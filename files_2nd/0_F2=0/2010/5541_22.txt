Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board on 15 November 2010.
Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and registered in England.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual Income Statement and related notes.
These accounts are for the Company and are not consolidated financial statements.
Separate consolidated financial statements for the Group are prepared under IFRS and are published separately within this document.
property, plant and equipment Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost.
The Companys licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset.
Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlords fixtures and fittings and short life landlords fixtures and fittings.
Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The useful economic life of additions to long life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and short life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 5 years.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment.
Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment.
Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.

Accounting policies continued Leases Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the Balance Sheet as intangible assets: lease premiums within non-current assets and are amortised over the lease term.
The Company enters into sale and leaseback transactions where a Pub has been sold and the Company has immediately entered into a lease agreement with the acquiree.
These Pubs have been classified as operating leases.
They are no longer included within Property, Plant and Equipment and the rentals paid are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of selling costs.
Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for disposal by the Company.
They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable.
These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Investments Fixed asset investments are initially recognised at fair value and then held at this value subject to an annual impairment test.
Current assets held for sale Current assets held for sale comprises tenants fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Financial instruments i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, debentures and secured bonds are measured at amortised cost.
This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.

Accounting policies continued iii Derivative financial instruments The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are subsequently re-stated to fair value at each reporting date.
Any change in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted.
Hedge accounting is only adopted where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it meets the Companys risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge, which meets the conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
To the extent that the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur any related cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective shall be reclassified from equity to the Income Statement as a reclassification adjustment.
iv Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in called up share capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in share premium.
v Trade debtors and creditors Trade debtors and creditors are held at amortised cost.
Net debt Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities not including trade receivables and trade payables less cash.
Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to off set current tax assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity.
Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
104 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
pension obligations The Company has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees own pension plans is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The net amount recognised in the Balance Sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the schemes assets.
This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit.
The net of the expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, re-issued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.
revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, volume rebates and VAT.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Sales of beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees.
Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 and applied its requirements to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each Balance Sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
The fair value of share options is measured using valuation models.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 105 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
New standards and interpretations During the year the Company has adopted the following new standards, interpretations and amendments: n Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items effective 1 July 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Statement Disclosures effective 1 October 2009 The revision to IAS 1 separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The Statement of Changes in Equity is now shown as a primary statement.
The Company has chosen to present the new Statement of Comprehensive Income as a linked statement to the Income Statement rather than as one single statement.
Other than the amendment to IAS 1 the above have not had a material impact on the results of the Company.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Company will be required to implement the standard: n IFRS 9: Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2013 not yet endorsed n IFRS 7: Financial Instrument Disclosures effective 1 July 2011 n Amendment to IAS 17 Leases effective for accounting periods starting after 1 January 2010 use of accounting estimates and judgements The Company makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: a property, plant and Equipment Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The valuation is based on market observations and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing.
Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub.
Further information about the valuation of the pub estate is provided in note 4 of these accounts.
The Company estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
106 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued b Valuation of interest rate swaps The Company measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each Balance Sheet date.
The swap valuation rates are derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the valuation rate for the period from the Balance Sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
c Taxation Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise.
The Company reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
d other The Company also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension liability.
However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

The land and buildings were valued at market value as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book, reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield.
The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies under which the properties are let.
Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and tenure.
The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by Humberts Leisure Limited 2,076 pubs.
The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc has been valued by the Head of Estates 1,423 pubs.
The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers.
This review ensured that the results are consistent.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are held at fair value less costs to sell.
This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds ERV which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: Licensed land and buildings m At 30 September 2010 Cost 1,798 Accumulated depreciation 28 Net book value 1,770 At 30 September 2009 Cost 1,949 Accumulated depreciation 30 Net book value 1,919 The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2010 was 103 million 2009 116 million.
Additions during the year include 1 million of property held under finance leases 2009 1 million.
At 30 September 2010, the Company had entered into contractual commitments to purchase 2 million 2009 2 million of property, plant and equipment.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Fair values The debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, independent valuers.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of the debenture and bonds is measured at market price.
The finance lease payables are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
The book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below: 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 Nominal Book Fair Nominal Book Fair value value value value value value Interest rate m m m m m m Bank borrowings LIBOR 1.2% 686 675 675 802 801 802 Corporate bonds: Debenture issued 3 February 1999 6% 60 60 55 60 60 51 Secured bond issued 9 May 2000 6.875% 125 124 100 125 124 93 Secured bond issued 15 February 2001 6.875% 125 124 105 125 124 95 Secured bond issued 26 February 2002 6.375% 275 272 201 275 272 197 Secured bond issued 3 March 2003 6.5% 600 601 513 600 601 483 1,185 1,181 974 1,185 1,181 919 Interest rate swaps: 275m swap expiring 1 June 2012 6.662% 32 32 350m swap expiring 30 September 2011 4.887% 22 22 54 54 1,871 1,856 1,649 1,987 2,036 1,775 Finance lease payables note 11 2 2 2 2 Intercompany: Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings 69 69 47 47 Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings 100 100 Total debt 1,871 1,789 1,582 1,987 2,091 1,830 Cash 8 8 11 11 Underlying net debt net debt 1,863 1,781 1,976 2,080 Bank borrowings, the corporate bonds and the amounts owed by and to subsidiary undertakings are held at amortised cost.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate swaps On 30 September 2010, the 350 million swap expiring 30 September 2011 was cancelled.
The Company paid 14 million to eliminate the fair value of the swap at the date of cancellation.
This swap was previously designated as an effective hedge.
On 27 May 2010, the 275 million swap expiring 1 June 2012 was cancelled.
The Company paid 30 million to eliminate the fair value of the swap at the date of cancellation.
This swap was not designated as an effective hedge.
Prior to cancelling a further 2 million was paid to restructure this interest rate swap.
On 29 September 2006 the Company designated the 350 million swap referred to above as an effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39.
As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap were recognised directly in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge recognised in the Income Statement.
In line with Company accounting policy, to the extent that the forecast transaction, being the underlying debt, is no longer expected to occur, any related cumulative losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified to the Income Statement.
As a result of the Group refinancing in May 2010 a significant portion of the debt against which the interest rate swap is hedged, is no longer expected to exist due to planned reductions in the level of the debt.
This has resulted in a reclassification from the cash flow hedge reserve to the Income Statement of 19 million.
After taking into account a 5 million fair value credit the net charge to the Income Statement in relation to this interest rate swap is 14 million.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 October 54 10 Cancellation of interest rate swaps 46 Fair value movements: ineffective portion and swaps not designated as effective hedges recognised in Income Statement 6 22 effective portion recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve 2 22 At 30 September 54 Financial instruments and risk The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Companys operations.
The Company has entered into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps.
The purpose of such transactions was to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Companys sources of finance.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 115 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2010 9.
Financial assets and liabilities continued The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in Sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows: Liquidity risk The Company has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due.
The Companys objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank loans and debentures.
This objective is achieved through the following processes: n Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function n Regular review of the Companys debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile n Maintenance of bank facilities At 30 September 2010, the nominal value of the Companys borrowings excluding interest rate swaps and finance lease payables comprised: 2010 2009 Bank borrowings 37% 40% Corporate bonds 63% 60% The maturity of the Companys debt and interest payments, including interest rate swap liabilities, is set out below: 2010 2009 Debt Interest Total Debt Interest Total m m m m m m In more than five years 1,125 534 1,659 1,125 608 1,733 In more than two years but not more than five years 685 250 935 60 235 295 In more than one year but not more than two years 104 104 802 101 903 In one year or less or on demand 61 104 165 115 115 1,871 992 2,863 1,987 1,059 3,046 The table above shows the contractual, undiscounted cash flows due in future periods to settle the Companys debt and interest payments, including interest rate swaps.
The book value of Company debt includes the fair value of the interest rate swaps which is based on discounted cash flow, and unamortised fees: this means that the total amount payable shown above differs from the total book value of Company debt.
The contractual maturity of trade and other payables is within one year.
An analysis of minimum lease payments due under finance leases is set out in note 11.

Financial assets and liabilities continued The Companys bank borrowings and secured bonds are repayable as follows: Bank borrowings 2011 Forward start facility 20122013 Corporate bonds 60 million 6% Debenture 2014 125 million 6.875% bond 2025 125 million 6.875% bond 2021 275 million 6.375% bond 2031 600 million 6.5% bond 2018 Details of undrawn borrowing facilities available at 30 September are as follows: 2010 2009 Expiring: m m In more than five years In more than two years but not more than five years In more than one year but not more than two years 198 In one year or less or on demand 114 114 198 The new Forward Start Facility that was signed in May 2010 is fully committed and will commence in May 2011 when the current bank facility matures.
The new facility of 625 million comprises a tranche of 206 million which expires in December 2012 and a tranche of 419 million which expires in December 2013.
The overall facility will amortise at an amount of 25 million every six months, commencing in December 2011.
A margin of 3.5% is now being paid on current borrowings by lenders who are participating in the new facility.
Interest rate risk The Company borrows its debenture and bonds at a fixed rate.
Bank debt is borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at a floating rate.
The Companys objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed through the monitoring of forecast interest rates.
At 30 September 2010, the Companys borrowings had an average interest rate of 6.4% for eight years 2009 average rate of 6.6% for eight years.
The interest payable was 63% fixed 2009 91% fixed after including the impact of interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest rates.
The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.

The Company is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances.
The Companys objective is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2010 the value of collateral is 24 million 2009 25 million.
This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by licensees.
2010 2009 m m Provision as at 1 October 2 2 Increase in provision during the year 1 2 Provision utilised during the year 1 1 Provision released during the year 1 1 Provision as at 30 September 1 2 There are no indications as at 30 September 2010 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired.
The maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables.
The Companys credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Company only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Security Senior debt finance is secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which comprise the Company, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries and Unique Pubs Limited and its subsidiaries.
The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such Group companies.
The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and secured bonds.
The value of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2010 is Property, Plant and Equipment 2,641 million 2009 2,885 million, operating lease premiums 6 million 2009 6 million and pubs held for sale 15 million 2009 20 million.
Covenants The Company is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities.
They include a covenant on net debt to EBITDA, minimum EBITDA to interest ratio and asset and debt ratios.
The Company tests these covenants on a regular basis and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting process.
These are reviewed at Board level.
Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The Company defines capital as total equity.
The capital structure is managed to support the Companys objective of maximising long-term shareholder value through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost-effective borrowing and flexibility to fund business and acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Company is based upon managements judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Companys operational and strategic requirements.
The overall financing strategy of the Company is presented to the Board annually for approval.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity.
Net debt is defined as the book value of the Companys debt less cash and cash equivalents note 9.
Equity is defined as total shareholders funds.
The Board considers capital structure when recommending dividends.
Given the current degree of market uncertainty, the Board does not consider that the resumption of dividends would now be appropriate.

Deferred tax The deferred tax in the Company Balance Sheet relates to the following: 2010 2009 m m Unrealised surplus on revaluation of fixed assets and rolled over gains 195 225 Accelerated capital allowances 84 84 Fair value of interest rate swaps 3 15 Share-based payments 2 2 Other temporary differences 1 274 293 In June 2010, the UK government announced its intention to propose Parliament reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 28% to 24% by 1 April 2014 by enacting, every year until 2014, a reduction of 1%.
At 30 September 2010 the first of these reductions, being a change in UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% on 1 April 2011, had been substantively enacted therefore the deferred tax assets and liabilities included within these Financial Statements have been calculated based on this reduced current UK corporation tax rate of 27%.
The forecast effect of the further above proposed reductions in rate by 2014 would be to decrease the net deferred tax liability by 31 million.
9 million is expected to be recognised in the Income Statement and 22 million in equity.
The government also announced that the main rate of capital allowances will fall from 20% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2012, with the rate in respect of integral features falling from 10% to 8%.
The impact on the timing of the capital allowance receipts has not been quantified as it is not practicable to do so.
The Company has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries on the basis that under current enacted law, no tax is payable on dividends payable and receivable within the Company.
