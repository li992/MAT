In addition to the ordinary business, four resolutions are proposed as special business, one as an ordinary resolution and three as special resolutions.
Ordinary Resolution 9 and Special Resolution 10: Authority to Allot Shares Resolution 9 is an Ordinary Resolution to seek authority for the Directors to allot up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital, this being an aggregate nominal amount of 4,877,918 as at 28 May 2010.
Resolution 10 is a Special Resolution which seeks authority to issue up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital pursuant to a rights issue or otherwise than in connection with a rights issue, dis-applying pre-emption rights.
This will allow shares to be issued to new shareholders, within the prescribed limits, without having to be offered to existing shareholders first, thus broadening the shareholder base of the Company.
The Directors will not use the authority to dilute the interests of existing shareholders by issuing shares at a price which is less than the Net Asset Value of the existing shares in issue at that time.
These authorities will expire at the next AGM of the Company or fifteen months after the passing of the resolutions, whichever is the earlier.
Special Resolution 11: Authority to Buy Back Shares Resolution 11 seeks to renew the Directors authority to purchase up to 14.99% of the Companys issued share capital, this being 29,247,998 ordinary shares as at 28 May 2010.
The authority will expire at the Companys next AGM or on 20 January 2012, if earlier.
The principal purpose of share buy backs is to enhance the net asset value for remaining shareholders and purchases will only be made if they enhance the net asset value for the remaining shareholders.
In accordance with the Financial Services Authority UK Listing Rules, the maximum price which can be paid is 5% above the average of the middle market values of the ordinary shares for the five business days before the purchase is made.
The minimum price which may be paid will be 25p per share, this being the nominal value of a share.
In making purchases, the Company will deal only with member firms of the London Stock Exchange.
The Company will finance the purchase of ordinary shares by using its existing cash balance or by selling securities in the Companys portfolio.
The Directors might consider holding repurchased shares as treasury shares with a view to possible resale.
Special Resolution 12: Notice Period for General Meetings The EU Shareholder Rights Directive, which was implemented in 2009, increased the notice period for general meetings of companies to 21 days unless certain conditions are met in which case it may be 14 days notice.
A shareholders resolution is required to ensure that the Companys general meetings other than Annual General Meetings may be held on 14 days notice.
Accordingly, Special Resolution 12 will propose that the period of notice for general meetings of the Company other than AGMs shall be not less than 14 days notice.
The Directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of all the resolutions.
