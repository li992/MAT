5 1 Cash which was transferred from Capital Shopping Centres Group to the Group prior to completion of the demerger.
2 Represents demerger and related costs which were allocated to the Group by Capital Shopping Centres Group.
3 Information in the prospectus was prepared using conventions commonly adopted for preparation of financial information for inclusion in investment circulars.
This resulted in certain departures from IFRS: the most significant being IAS 27.
The prospectus included assets under control of Capco management whereas the comparatives only include assets demerged from Capital Shopping Centres Group.
This was outlined on page 80 of the prospectus.
4 Debt due to Capital Shopping Centres Group was classied as Equity in the prospectus as these assets were to be demerged and form part of Capco equity.
On a comparative basis however these legally took the form of debt and are disclosed as such for the comparative period.
This was highlighted on page 80 of the prospectus.
5 Included in the prospectus was a pro forma allocation of overhead costs which had not historically been recharged by Capital Shopping Centres Group.
For the comparatives this pro forma allocation falls away.
This was highlighted on page 81 of the prospectus.
6 The objective of merger accounting is to report the consolidated financial position of the Group as if it had always been combined.
Consequently, the share capital issued for the purposes of the transaction is shown as if it has always been in issue.
