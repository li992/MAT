IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASBs predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC and its predecessor body.
The EU endorsed version of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relaxes some of the hedge accounting requirements: the Group has not taken advantage of this relaxation, and therefore there is no difference in application to the Group between IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, available-for-sale financial assets, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts.
As stated on page 113, the directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
During 2010, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee clarified the treatment of amounts previously recognised in equity in respect of assets that were transferred from the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category.
When an impairment loss is recognised in respect of such transferred financial assets, the unamortised balance of any available-for-sale revaluation reserve that remains in equity should be transferred to the income statement and recorded as part of the impairment loss.
The Group has changed its accounting policy to reflect this clarification.
Under the Groups previous accounting policy, when such a transferred financial asset became impaired, not all of the unamortised amounts previously transferred to equity were recycled to the income statement and therefore continued to be accreted over the expected remaining life of the financial asset.
This change is applied retrospectively and the effect has been to reduce retained profits and increase available-for-sale revaluation reserves by 131 million at 1 January 2009: shareholders equity is unchanged.
There was no material effect on the Groups income statement during 2009.
Also during 2010, the Group has classified assets as held-to-maturity for the first time.
Purchases of government debt securities of 4,228 million made in the second half of 2010 were classified as held-to-maturity on acquisition, were initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and are being measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Further, on 1 November 2010, government debt securities with a carrying value of 3,601 million, previously classified as available-for-sale, were reclassified to held-to-maturity.
Unrealised gains on the transferred securities of 223 million previously taken to equity continue to be held in the available-for-sale revaluation reserve and will be amortised to the income statement over the remaining lives of the securities using the effective interest method or until the assets become impaired.
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards which became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2010.
None of these standards or amendments have had a material impact on these financial statements.
This revised standard applies prospectively to business combinations from 1 January 2010.
The revised standard continues to require the use of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
All payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, some contingent payments are subsequently remeasured at fair value through income, goodwill may be calculated based on the parents share of net assets or it may include goodwill related to the non-controlling interest, and all transaction costs are expensed other than those in relation to the issuance of debt instruments or share capital.
ii IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
Requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control: any remaining interest in an investee is remeasured to fair value in determining the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss where control over the investee is lost.
iii IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners.
Provides accounting guidance for non-reciprocal distributions of non-cash assets to owners and those in which owners may elect to receive a cash alternative.
iv Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Eligible Hedged Items.
Clarifies how the principles underlying hedge accounting should be applied in particular situations.
v Improvements to IFRSs issued April 2009.
Sets out minor amendments to IFRS standards as part of the annual improvements process.
Details of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31 December 2010 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 58.
154 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups accounting policies are set out below.
A CONSOLIDATION The assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings including special purpose entities are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date.
Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries include entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies which generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in note 9 to the parent company financial statements.
Investment vehicles, such as Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs, where the Group has control, typically through acting as fund manager and the life funds having a beneficial interest greater than 50 per cent, are consolidated.
The non-controlling unitholders interest is reported in other liabilities.
Special purpose entities SPEs are consolidated if, in substance, the Group controls the entity.
A key indicator of such control, amongst others, is where the Group is exposed to the risks and benefits of the SPE.
The treatment of transactions with non-controlling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Change in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions: any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity.
Where the group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any non-controlling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value: the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments see E 5 below or share capital see R 1 below.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.
2 Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control under a contractual arrangement with other parties.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity and is normally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting share capital of the entity.
The Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business.
These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Otherwise, the Groups investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each year to reflect the Groups share of the post-acquisition results of the joint venture or associate based on audited accounts which are coterminous with the Group or made up to a date which is not more than three months before the Groups reporting date.
The share of any losses is restricted to a level that reflects an obligation to fund such losses.
B GOODWILL Goodwill arises on business combinations, including the acquisition of subsidiaries, and on the acquisition of interests in joint ventures and associates: goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment.
If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the Groups investment in joint ventures and associates.
At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal except where it has been written off directly to reserves in the past.

Intangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: Capitalised software enhancements up to 5 years Brands which have been assessed as having finite lives 10-15 years Customer-related intangibles up to 10 years Core deposit intangibles up to 8 years Purchased credit card relationships 5 years Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired.
If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately.
Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised.
Such intangible assets are reassessed annually to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate.
In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate a finite life is determined and an impairment review is performed on the asset.
D REVENUE RECOGNITION Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all interest-bearing financial instruments using the effective interest method, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
The effective interest rate is calculated on initial recognition of the financial asset or liability by estimating the future cash flows after considering all the contractual terms of the instrument but not future credit losses.
The calculation includes all amounts expected to be paid or received by the Group including expected early redemption fees and related penalties and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return.
Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account in the calculation.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss see H below.
Fees and commissions which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are generally recognised when the service has been provided.
Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan once drawn.
Where it is unlikely that loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised over the life of the facility.
Loan syndication fees are recognised as revenue when the syndication has been completed and the Group retains no part of the loan package for itself or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for all interest-bearing financial instruments, including loans and advances, as for the other participants.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Revenue recognition policies specific to life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below see O below.
E FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets, held-to-maturity investments or loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.
Purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.
1 Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading securities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss by management.
Derivatives are carried at fair value see F below.
Trading securities are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains.
Such securities are classified as trading securities and recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such by management upon initial recognition.
Such assets and liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss on acquisition in the following circumstances: 156 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS it eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets and liabilities or recognising gains or losses on different bases.
The main type of financial assets designated by the Group at fair value through profit or loss are assets backing insurance contracts and investment contracts issued by the Groups life insurance businesses.
Fair value designation allows changes in the fair value of these assets to be recorded in the income statement along with the changes in the value of the associated liabilities, thereby significantly reducing the measurement inconsistency had the assets been classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
the assets and liabilities are part of a group which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, with management information also prepared on this basis.
As noted in A 2 above certain of the Groups investments are managed as venture capital investments and evaluated on the basis of their fair value and these assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
where the assets and liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for.
The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively.
If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Fair value of financial instruments and note 55 3 Financial instruments: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
The Group is permitted to reclassify, at fair value at the date of transfer, non-derivative financial assets other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss by the entity upon initial recognition out of the trading category if they are no longer held for the purpose of being sold or repurchased in the near term, as follows: if the financial assets would have met the definition of loans and receivables but for the fact that they had to be classified as held for trading at initial recognition, they may be reclassified into loans and receivables where the Group has the intention and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity: if the financial assets would not have met the definition of loans and receivables, they may be reclassified out of the held for trading category into available-for-sale financial assets in rare circumstances.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets Debt securities and equity shares that are not classified as trading securities, at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or as loans and receivables are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs.
Available-for-sale financial assets are those intended to be held for an indeterminate period of time and may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold, becomes impaired or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
The Group is permitted to transfer a financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category where that asset would have met the definition of loans and receivables at the time of reclassification if the financial asset had not been designated as available-for-sale and where there is both the intention and ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future.
Reclassification of a financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the held-to-maturity category is permitted when the Group has the ability and intent to hold that financial asset to maturity.
Reclassifications are made at fair value as of the reclassification date.
Fair value becomes the new cost or amortised cost as applicable.
Effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to the loans and receivables and held-to-maturity categories are determined at the reclassification date.
Any previous gain or loss on a transferred asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the effective interest method or until the asset becomes impaired.
Any difference between the new amortised cost and the expected cash flows is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using the effective interest method.
When an impairment loss is recognised in respect of available-for-sale assets transferred, the unamortised balance of any available-for-sale reserve that remains in equity is transferred to the income statement and recorded as part of the impairment loss.
3 Loans and receivables Loans and receivables include loans and advances to banks and customers and eligible assets including those transferred into this category out of the fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale financial assets categories.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers at fair value inclusive of transaction costs or, for eligible assets transferred into this category, their fair value at the date of transfer.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method see D above less provision for impairment see H below.
The Group has entered into securitisation and similar transactions to finance certain loans and advances to customers.
These loans and advances to customers continue to be recognised by the Group, together with a corresponding liability for the funding.

These are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
5 Borrowings Borrowings which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Preference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities.
The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense.
An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
When a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the original carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in the profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
6 Sale and repurchase agreements Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained.
Funds received under these arrangements are included in deposits from banks, customer deposits, or trading liabilities.
Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos, where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are recorded as loans and receivables or trading securities.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained in the financial statements.
Securities borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
7 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred: or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished ie when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expire.
F DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING All derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including recent market transactions, and using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and option pricing models, as appropriate.
Derivatives are carried in the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that is not part of a hedging relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in financial instruments and insurance contracts unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, a policyholders option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount is not treated as an embedded derivative.
158 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of the same.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item and the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of the particular risks inherent in recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedges : 2 hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to recognised assets or liabilities cash flow hedges : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
These are accounted for as follows: 1 Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk: this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.
2 Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
3 Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.
G OFFSET Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.
H IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 1 Assets accounted for at amortised cost At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether, as a result of one or more events occurring after initial recognition of the financial asset and prior to the balance sheet date, there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has become impaired.
Where such an event has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, an impairment allowance is recognised.
The amount of impairment allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
If the asset has a variable rate of interest, the discount rate used for measuring the impairment allowance is the current effective interest rate.
Subsequent to the recognition of an impairment loss on a financial asset or a group of financial assets, interest income continues to be recognised on an effective interest rate basis, on the assets carrying value net of impairment provisions.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, such as an improvement in the borrowers credit rating, the allowance is adjusted and the amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment allowances are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant.
Such individual assessment is used primarily for the Groups wholesale lending portfolios in the Wholesale and Wealth and International divisions.
Impairment allowances for portfolios of smaller balance homogenous loans such as most residential mortgages, personal loans and credit card balances in the Groups retail portfolios in both the Retail and Wealth and International divisions that are below the individual assessment thresholds, and for loan losses that have been incurred but not separately identified at the balance sheet date, are determined on a collective basis.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 159 Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 14 Board of Directors 110 Report of the independent Shareholder information 284 Lloyds Banking Group auditors on the consolidated Group structure 2 Divisional results 26 Directors report 112 Glossary 285 Annual Report financial statements 144 Group performance 3 Other financial information 52 Corporate governance report 114 Abbreviations 290 and Accounts 2010 Consolidated Strategy and progress 4 Five year financial summary 56 Directors remuneration report 124 Index to annual report 291 financial statements 146 Chairmans statement 6 Our people 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 Group Chief Executives review 8 Corporate responsibility 60 Report of the independent Addressing the key issues 10 Risk management 65 auditors on the parent company Marketplace trends 12 financial statements 272 Parent company financial statements 273 Notes to the parent company financial statements 276 INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT In respect of individually significant financial assets in the Groups wholesale lending portfolios, assets are reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed on a watch list where greater monitoring is undertaken and any adverse or potentially adverse impact on ability to repay is used in assessing whether an asset should be transferred to a dedicated Business Support Unit.
Specific examples of trigger events that would lead to the initial recognition of impairment allowances against lending to corporate borrowers or the recognition of additional impairment allowances include i trading losses, loss of business or major customer of a borrower, ii material breaches of the terms and conditions of a loan facility, including non-payment of interest or principal, or a fall in the value of security such that it is no longer considered adequate, iii disappearance of an active market because of financial difficulties, or iv restructuring a facility with preferential terms to aid recovery of the lending such as a debt for equity swap.
For such individually identified financial assets, a review is undertaken of the expected future cash flows which requires significant management judgement as to the amount and timing of such cash flows.
Where the debt is secured, the assessment reflects the expected cash flows from the realisation of the security, net of costs to realise, whether or not foreclosure or realisation of the collateral is probable.
For impaired debt instruments which are held at amortised cost, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows.
A reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
COLLECTIVE ASSESSMENT In respect of portfolios of smaller balance, homogenous loans, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
Segmentation takes into account factors such as the type of asset, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the borrowers ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Generally, the impairment trigger used within the impairment calculation for a loan, or group of loans, is when they reach a pre-defined level of delinquency or where the customer is bankrupt.
Loans where the Group provides arrangements that forgive a portion of interest or principal are also deemed to be impaired and loans that are originated to refinance currently impaired assets are also defined as impaired.
In respect of the Groups secured mortgage portfolios, the impairment allowance is calculated based on a definition of impaired loans which are those six months or more in arrears or where the borrower is bankrupt or is in possession.
The estimated cash flows are calculated based on historical experience and are dependent on estimates of the expected value of collateral which takes into account expected future movements in house prices, less costs to sell.
For unsecured personal lending portfolios, the impairment trigger is generally when the balance is two or more instalments in arrears or where the customer has exhibited one or more of the impairment characteristics noted above.
While the trigger is based on the payment performance or circumstances of each individual asset, the assessment of future cash flows uses historical experience of cohorts of similar portfolios such that the assessment is considered to be collective.
Future cash flows are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the cohort and historical loss experience for similar assets.
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
The collective provision also includes provision for inherent losses, that is losses that have been incurred but have not been identified at the balance sheet date.
The loans that are not currently recognised as impaired are grouped into homogenous portfolios by key risk drivers.
An assessment is made, based on statistical techniques, of the likelihood of each account becoming recognised as impaired within an emergence period, with the economic loss that each portfolio is likely to generate were it to become impaired.
The emergence period is the time between the loss event and the date the impairment is recognised.
The emergence period is determined by local management for each portfolio.
In general the periods used across the Group vary between one month and twelve months based on historical experience.
LOAN RENEGOTIATIONS AND FORBEARANCE In certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customers loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower.
There are a number of different types of loan renegotiation, including the capitalisation of arrears, payment holidays, interest rate adjustments and extensions of the due date of payment.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will not recover the original carrying value of the asset, the asset continues to be reported as past due and is considered impaired.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will recover the original carrying value of the asset, the loan is no longer reported as past due or impaired provided that payments are made in accordance with the revised terms.
In other cases, renegotiation may lead to a new agreement, which is treated as a new loan.
WRITE OFFS A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement.
160 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DEBT FOR EQUITY EXCHANGES Equity securities acquired in exchange for loans in order to achieve an orderly realisation are accounted for as a disposal of the loan and an acquisition of equity securities.
Where control is obtained over an entity as a result of the transaction, the entity is consolidated: where the Group has significant influence over an entity as a result of the transaction, the investment is accounted for by the equity method of accounting see A above.
Any subsequent impairment of the assets or business acquired is treated as an impairment of the relevant asset or business and not as an impairment of the original instrument.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired.
In addition to the criteria for financial assets accounted for at amortised cost set out above, this assessment involves reviewing the current financial circumstances including creditworthiness and future prospects of the issuer assessing the future cash flows expected to be realised and, in the case of equity shares, considering whether there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost.
If an impairment loss has been incurred, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised, is reclassified from equity to the income statement.
For impaired debt instruments, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows: a reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, an amount not greater than the original impairment loss is credited to the income statement: any excess is taken to other comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
I INVESTMENT PROPERTY Investment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
The Groups investment property primarily relates to property held for long-term rental yields and capital appreciation within the life insurance funds.
Investment property is carried in the balance sheet at fair value, being the open market value as determined in accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices.
These valuations are reviewed at least annually by an independent valuation expert.
Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be measured at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement as net trading income.
J TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS Tangible fixed assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The value of land included in premises is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Premises excluding land : Freehold long and short leasehold premises: shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease Leasehold improvements: shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease Equipment: Fixtures and furnishings: 10-20 years Other equipment and motor vehicles: 2-8 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
K LEASES 1 As lessee The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the end of the lease period, any payment made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period of termination.
2 As lessor Assets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of provisions, within loans and advances to Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 161 Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 14 Board of Directors 110 Report of the independent Shareholder information 284 Lloyds Banking Group auditors on the consolidated Group structure 2 Divisional results 26 Directors report 112 Glossary 285 Annual Report financial statements 144 Group performance 3 Other financial information 52 Corporate governance report 114 Abbreviations 290 and Accounts 2010 Consolidated Strategy and progress 4 Five year financial summary 56 Directors remuneration report 124 Index to annual report 291 financial statements 146 Chairmans statement 6 Our people 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 Group Chief Executives review 8 Corporate responsibility 60 Report of the independent Addressing the key issues 10 Risk management 65 auditors on the parent company Marketplace trends 12 financial statements 272 Parent company financial statements 273 Notes to the parent company financial statements 276 banks and customers.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income.
Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.
Operating lease assets are included within tangible fixed assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values.
Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
The Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted for separately.
L PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions: there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
Full actuarial valuations of the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years: these valuations are updated to 31 December each year by qualified independent actuaries, or in the case of the Scottish Widows Retirement Benefits Scheme, by a qualified actuary employed by Scottish Widows.
For the purposes of these annual updates scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The Groups income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, the expected return on the schemes assets, net of expected administration costs, and the interest cost on the schemes liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are not recognised unless the cumulative unrecognised gain or loss at the end of the previous reporting period exceeds the greater of 10 per cent of the scheme assets or liabilities the corridor approach.
In these circumstances the excess is charged or credited to the income statement over the employees expected average remaining working lives.
Past service costs are charged immediately to the income statement, unless the charges are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Groups balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date adjusted for any cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains or losses.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes.
The Group recognises the effect of material changes to the terms of its defined benefit pension plans which reduce future benefits as curtailments: gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the curtailments occur.
The costs of the Groups defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
M SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised.
Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement over the remaining vesting period, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Groups Save As You Earn plans are treated as non-vesting conditions and in accordance with IFRS 2 Revised the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period.
Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the income statement over any remaining vesting period.
N TAXATION Current income tax which is payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
For the Groups long-term insurance businesses, the tax charge is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders returns and tax that is payable on equity holders returns.
This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under current UK tax rules.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset 162 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Income tax payable on profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which those profits arise.
The tax effects of losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred and current tax related to gains and losses on the fair value re-measurement of available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges, where these gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Such tax is subsequently transferred to the income statement together with the gain or loss.
Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both a legal right of offset and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
O INSURANCE The Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business.
Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: Insurance contracts these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk.
The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur.
These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features.
Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specified assets.
Non-participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature.
The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.
1 Life insurance business i ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE AND PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS Premiums and claims Premiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received.
Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.
Liabilities Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Groups with-profit funds Liabilities of the Groups with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Financial Services Authoritys realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus see below.
Further details on the realistic capital regime are given on page 103.
Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised through insurance claims.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Groups with-profit funds A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised.
The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.
Assumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.
Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked Liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate such as for any excess of future expenses over charges.
The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals.
Changes in the value of the liability are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims.
Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.

ii ACCOUNTING FOR NON-PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS The Groups non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked.
These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Groups unitised investment funds.
The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date.
Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to those contracts are recognised in insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.
The Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested.
These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract.
These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.
Costs which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred.
This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and is reviewed for impairment in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
iii VALUE OF IN-FORCE BUSINESS The Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The asset represents the present value of the shareholders interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date.
This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees.
Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the income statement.
The Groups contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts.
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.
2 General insurance business The Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products.
Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer: premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts and only credited to the income statement when earned.
Broking commission are recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer.
Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon past experience.
The underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts.
In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases.
Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
Claims liabilities are not discounted.
3 Liability adequacy test At each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business.
In performing these tests current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.
4 Reinsurance Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more contracts issued by the Group and that meet the classification requirements for insurance contracts are classified as reinsurance contracts held.
164 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The benefits to which the Group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as reinsurance assets.
These assets consist of short-term balances due from reinsurers as well as longer term receivables that are dependent on the expected claims and benefits arising under the related reinsured contracts.
Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment.
Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income.
Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
P FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on available-for-sale non-monetary financial assets, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.
The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments see F 3 above.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation are reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal.
Q PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
The Group recognises provisions in respect of vacant leasehold property where the unavoidable costs of the present obligations exceed anticipated rental income.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.
R SHARE CAPITAL 1 Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2 Dividends Dividends paid on the Groups ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.
3 Treasury shares Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory balances with central banks and amounts due from banks with a maturity of less than three months.

Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The significant judgements made by management in applying the Groups accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements, which together are deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, are as follows.
The estimates and judgements applied to these areas in the preparation of the Groups financial statements are summarised below.
ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LOANS AND RECEIVABLES At 31 December 2010 gross loans and receivables totalled 667,555 million 2009: 710,362 million against which impairment allowances of 18,951 million 2009: 15,380 million had been made see note 25.
The Groups accounting policy for losses arising on financial assets classified as loans and receivables is described in note 2 H 1 : this note also provides an overview of the methodologies applied.
The allowance for impairment losses on loans and receivables is managements best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
Impairment allowances are made up of two components, those determined individually and those determined collectively.
Individual impairment allowances are generally established against the Groups wholesale lending portfolios.
The determination of individual impairment allowances requires the exercise of considerable judgement by management involving matters such as local economic conditions and the resulting trading performance of the customer, and the value of the security held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.
In particular, significant judgement is required by management in the current economic environment in assessing the borrowers cash flows and debt servicing capability together with the realisable value of real estate collateral.
The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
Collective impairment allowances are generally established for smaller balance homogenous portfolios.
The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and in particular is sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions, including the interdependency of house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers behaviour, and consumer bankruptcy trends.
It is, however, inherently difficult to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
Given the relative size of the mortgage portfolio, a key variable is UK house prices which determine the collateral value supporting loans in such portfolios.
The value of this collateral is estimated by applying changes in house price indices to the original assessed value of the property.
If average house prices were 10 per cent lower than those estimated at 31 December 2010, the Retail divisions impairment charge would increase by approximately 250 million.
In addition, a collective unimpaired provision is made for loan losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
This provision is sensitive to changes in the time between the loss event and the date the impairment is specifically identified.
This period is known as the loss emergence period.
In the Wholesale division, an increase of one month in the loss emergence period in respect of the loan portfolio assessed for collective unimpaired provisions would result in an increase in the collective unimpaired provision of approximately 333 million.
UNWIND OF HBOS ACQUISITION FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS The acquisition of HBOS in January 2009 required the Group to recognise the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values.
The overall effect was to increase the book value of HBOSs net assets by 1,241 million primarily reflecting a reduction in the value of HBOSs debt securities and subordinated liabilities of 15,439 million, partially offset by a reduction in the carrying value of HBOSs loans and receivables of 14,880 million, including loans and advances to customers of 13,512 million see note 14.
In the periods subsequent to the acquisition, many of the fair value adjustments unwind and are recognised in the Groups income statement.
The fair value adjustments made to debt securities and subordinated liabilities unwind over the expected remaining life of the related securities except in the event that the liability is extinguished, in which case the remaining unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value adjustment relating to loans and receivables broadly comprises two elements: an element reflecting expected future impairment losses at the date of acquisition and an element reflecting market liquidity.
The element relating to market liquidity unwinds to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
However, significant management judgement is required to determine the timing of the unwind of the element relating to future credit losses.
This includes the identification of losses which were expected at the date of acquisition and assessing whether anticipated losses will still be incurred.
In 2010, a net credit of 3,118 million to the income statement relates to the unwind of HBOS acquisition fair value adjustments.
Of that amount, 2,229 million relates to impairment losses incurred which were expected at the date of acquisition and 845 million relates to a reassessment of future credit losses.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group categorises financial instruments carried on the balance sheet at fair value using a three level hierarchy.
Financial instruments categorised as level 1 are valued using quoted market prices and therefore there is minimal judgement applied in determining fair value.
However, the fair value of financial instruments categorised as level 2 and, in particular, level 3 is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and valuation models.
These require management judgement and contain significant estimation uncertainty.
166 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In particular, significant judgement is required by management in determining appropriate assumptions to be used for level 3 financial instruments.
At 31 December 2010, the Group classified 7,468 million of financial assets and 257 million of financial liabilities as level 3.
The effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions in determining the fair value of the Groups level 3 financial assets is set out in note 55.
RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS At 31 December 2010 the Group carried deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of 4,164 million 2009: 5,006 million and deferred tax liabilities of 247 million 2009: 209 million note 44.
This presentation takes into account the ability of the Group to net deferred tax assets and liabilities only where there is a legally enforceable right of offset.
Note 44 presents the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities by type.
The largest category of deferred tax asset relates to tax losses carried forward.
At 31 December 2010, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of 6,572 million 2009 5,925 million in respect of tax losses carried forward.
The recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses is permitted only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise the tax losses carried forward.
The assessment of future taxable profits involves significant estimation uncertainty, principally relating to managements projections of future taxable income which are based on business plans.
These projections include assumptions about the future strategy of the Group, the economic and regulatory environment in which the Group operates, future tax legislation, customer behaviour, and the ability of the Group to deliver expected integration benefits, amongst other variables.
At 31 December 2010, management has concluded that future taxable profits generated by the Group companies with tax losses carried forward are expected to be sufficient to utilise the tax losses carried forward in full.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The net asset recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 in respect of the Groups retirement benefit obligations was 313 million comprising an asset of 736 million and a liability of 423 million 2009: a liability of 780 million of which an asset of 479 million 2009: a liability of 619 million related to defined benefit pension schemes.
As explained in note 2 L, the Group adopts the corridor approach to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses in respect of its pension schemes and as a consequence has not recognised actuarial losses of 959 million 2009: 2,936 million.
The defined benefit pension schemes gross deficit totalled 480 million 2009: 3,555 million representing the difference between the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the related assets at the balance sheet date.
The value of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes liabilities requires significant management judgement in determining the appropriate assumptions to be used.
The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows and the expected lifetime of the schemes members.
The size of the deficit is sensitive to changes in the discount rate, which is affected by market conditions and therefore potentially subject to significant variation.
The cost of the benefits payable by the schemes will also depend upon the longevity of the members.
Assumptions are made regarding the expected lifetime of scheme members based upon recent experience, however given the rate of advance in medical science and increasing levels of obesity, it is uncertain whether they will ultimately reflect actual experience.
Assumptions used by management reflect recent longevity experience and extrapolate the improving trend.
The effect on the gross defined benefit pension scheme asset or liability and on the pension charge in the Groups income statement of changes to the principal actuarial assumptions is set out in note 43.
VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS At 31 December 2010, the Group recognised a value in-force business asset of 5,898 million 2009: 5,140 million and an acquired value in-force business asset of 1,469 million 2009: 1,545 million.
The value in-force business asset represents the present value of future profits expected to arise from the portfolio of in-force life insurance and participating investment contracts.
The acquired value in-force business asset represents the contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers.
The methodology used to value these assets is set out in note 2 O 1.
The valuation or recoverability of these assets requires assumptions to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to these assets.
The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value in-force business assets at 31 December 2010 are set out in note 30.
At 31 December 2010, the Group carried liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of 80,729 million 2009: 76,179 million.
The methodology used to value these liabilities is described in note 2 O 1.
Elements of the liability valuations require assumptions to be made about future investment returns, future mortality rates and future policyholder behaviour and are subject to significant management judgement and estimation uncertainty.
The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of these liabilities are set out in note 38.
The effect on the Groups profit before tax and shareholders equity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the life insurance assets and liabilities is set out in note 39.

The Group Executive Committee has been determined to be the chief operating decision maker for the Group.
The Groups operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures.
The Group Executive Committee reviews the Groups internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
This assessment includes a consideration of each segments net interest revenue and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented on a net basis.
The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided, by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities and by the geographical location of the customer.
The Groups activities continue to be organised into four financial reporting segments: Retail, Wholesale, Wealth and International and Insurance.
The segmental results and comparatives are presented on the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and as a consequence the comparatives for 2009 include the pre-acquisition results of HBOS for the period from 1 January 2009 to 16 January 2009.
Retail offers a broad range of retail financial service products in the UK, including current accounts, savings, personal loans, credit cards and mortgages.
It is also a major general insurance and bancassurance distributor, selling a wide range of long-term savings, investment and general insurance products.
The Wholesale division serves in excess of a million businesses ranging from start-ups and small enterprises to global corporations, with a range of propositions segmented according to customer need.
The division comprises Corporate Markets, Treasury and Trading and Asset Finance.
Wealth and International was created in 2009 to give increased focus and momentum to the Groups private banking and asset management activities and to closely co-ordinate the management of its international businesses.
Wealth comprises the Groups private banking, wealth and asset management businesses in the UK and overseas.
International comprises corporate, commercial, asset finance and retail businesses, principally in Australia and Continental Europe.
The Insurance division provides long-term savings, investment and protection products distributed through the retail branch network, intermediary and direct channels in the UK.
It is also a distributor of home insurance in the UK with products sold through the retail branch network, direct channels and strategic corporate partners.
The division consists of three business units: Life, Pensions and Investments UK: Life, Pensions and Investments Europe: and General Insurance.
Other includes the results of managing the Groups technology platforms, branch and head office property estate, operations including payments, banking operations and collections and procurement services, the costs of which are predominantly recharged to the other divisions.
It also reflects other items not recharged to the divisions, including hedge ineffectiveness and certain capital and wholesale liquidity funding costs.
Inter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, with the exception of the internal commission arrangements between the UK branch and other distribution networks and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group, where a profit margin is also charged.
Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.
For those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit retains the amount that would have been recognised on an accrual accounting basis an amount equal to the interest element of the next payment on the swap and transfers the remainder of the fair value of the swap to the central group segment where the resulting accounting volatility is managed though the establishment of hedge accounting relationships.
Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central group segment.
This allocation of the fair value of the swap and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and records volatility in the central group segment where it is managed.

These exchanges resulted in a gain on extinguishment of the existing liabilities of 423 million 2009: 1,498 million, being the difference between the carrying amount of the securities extinguished and the fair value of the new securities issued together with related fees and costs.
On 18 February 2010, as part of the Groups recapitalisation and exit from its proposed participation in the Government Asset Protection Scheme, Lloyds Banking Group plc issued 3,141 million ordinary shares in exchange for certain existing preference shares and preferred securities.
This exchange resulted in a gain of 85 million.
During March 2010 the Group entered into a bilateral exchange, under which certain Enhanced Capital Notes denominated in Japanese yen were exchanged for an issue of new Enhanced Capital Notes denominated in US dollars: the securities subject to the exchange were cancelled and a profit of 20 million arose.
In addition, during May and June 2010 the Group completed the exchange of a number of outstanding capital securities issued by Lloyds Banking Group plc and certain of its subsidiaries for ordinary shares in Lloyds Banking Group plc, generating additional core tier 1 capital for the Group.

In addition to this, during the second half of the year there was a change in commutation factors in certain defined benefit schemes.
The combined effect of these changes is a reduction in the Groups defined benefit obligation of 1,081 million and a reduction in the Groups unrecognised actuarial losses of 171 million, resulting in a net curtailment gain of 910 million recognised in the income statement and a reduction in the balance sheet liability.
2 52 million of the impairment of tangible fixed assets relates to integration activities.

The following types of services are included in the categories listed above: Audit fees: This category includes fees in respect of the audit of the Groups annual financial statements and other services in connection with regulatory filings.
Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to the costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act audit requirements together with the cost of the audit of the Groups Form 20-F filing.
Audit related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of prospectuses and circulars required by the UKLA listing rules.
Services relating to taxation: This category includes tax compliance and tax advisory services.
Other non-audit fees: This category includes due diligence relating to corporate finance, including venture capital transactions and other assurance and advisory services.
It is the Groups policy to use the auditors on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.
Such assignments typically relate to the provision of advice on tax issues, assistance in transactions involving the acquisition and disposal of businesses and accounting advice.
The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including that fees for audit and non-audit services are approved in advance.
This approval can be obtained either on an individual engagement basis or, for certain types of non-audit services, particularly those of a recurring nature, through the approval of a fee cap covering all engagements of that type provided the fee is below that cap.
All statutory audit work as well as non-audit assignments where the fee is expected to exceed the relevant fee cap must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis.
On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.
During the year, the auditors also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following: 2010 2009 m m Audits of Group pension schemes 0.3 0.3 Audits of the unconsolidated Open Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group 0.8 0.6 Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers 17.2 19.3 Acquisition due diligence and other work performed in respect of potential venture capital investments 1.2 1.4 178 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12 IMPAIRMENT 2010 2009 m m Impairment losses on loans and receivables: Loans and advances to banks 13 3 Loans and advances to customers 10,727 15,783 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 57 248 Total impairment losses on loans and receivables note 25 10,771 16,028 Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets 106 602 Other credit risk provisions note 45 75 43 Total impairment charged to the income statement 10,952 16,673 13 INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES The Groups share of results of and investments in joint ventures and associates comprises: Joint ventures Associates Total 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m m m Share of income statement amounts: Income 318 708 135 5 453 713 Expenses 209 544 91 96 300 640 Impairment 126 272 92 114 218 386 Insurance claims 465 465 Loss before tax 17 573 48 205 65 778 Tax 22 24 1 2 23 26 Share of post-tax results 39 549 49 203 88 752 Share of balance sheet amounts: Current assets 3,370 2,754 378 605 3,748 3,359 Non-current assets 2,868 4,662 1,184 1,611 4,052 6,273 Current liabilities 588 2,175 433 494 1,021 2,669 Non-current liabilities 5,324 4,871 1,026 1,613 6,350 6,484 Share of net assets at 31 December 326 370 103 109 429 479 Movement in investments over the year: At 1 January 370 55 109 479 55 Adjustment on acquisition 956 219 1,175 Additional investments 71 140 6 12 77 152 Acquisitions 3 60 63 Disposals 68 199 2 39 70 238 Share of post-tax results 39 549 49 203 88 752 Dividends paid 21 1 1 21 Exchange and other adjustments 8 15 40 60 32 45 Share of net assets at 31 December 326 370 103 109 429 479 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 179 Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 14 Board of Directors 110 Report of the independent Shareholder information 284 Lloyds Banking Group auditors on the consolidated Group structure 2 Divisional results 26 Directors report 112 Glossary 285 Annual Report financial statements 144 Group performance 3 Other financial information 52 Corporate governance report 114 Abbreviations 290 and Accounts 2010 Consolidated Strategy and progress 4 Five year financial summary 56 Directors remuneration report 124 Index to annual report 291 financial statements 146 Chairmans statement 6 Our people 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 Group Chief Executives review 8 Corporate responsibility 60 Report of the independent Addressing the key issues 10 Risk management 65 auditors on the parent company Marketplace trends 12 financial statements 272 Parent company financial statements 273 Notes to the parent company financial statements 276 13 INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES continued The Groups unrecognised share of losses of associates for the year is 8 million 2009: 64 million and of joint ventures is 180 million 2009: 424 million.
For entities making losses, subsequent profits earned are not recognised until previously unrecognised losses are extinguished.
The Groups unrecognised share of losses net of unrecognised profits on a cumulative basis of associates is 104 million 2009: 64 million and of joint ventures is 339 million 2009: 424 million.
The Groups principal joint venture investment at 31 December 2010 was in Sainsburys Bank plc: the Group owns 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Sainsburys Bank plc, whose business is banking and principal area of operation is the UK.
Sainsburys Bank plc is incorporated in the UK and the Groups interest is held by a subsidiary.
Where entities have statutory accounts drawn up to a date other than 31 December management accounts are used when accounting for them by the Group.
14 GAIN ON ACQUISITION IN 2009 On 16 January 2009, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of HBOS plc, which together with its subsidiaries undertakes banking, insurance and other financial services related activities in the UK and in certain overseas locations.
The table below sets out the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
At the time of the recommended offer for HBOS in September 2008, it had become increasingly difficult for HBOS to raise funds in wholesale markets and their Board sought to restore confidence and stability through an agreement to be acquired by Lloyds TSB Group plc announced on 18 September 2008 at the original terms of 0.833 Lloyds TSB Group plc shares for each HBOS share.
However turbulence in the markets continued and the UK Government decided in October 2008 that it would be appropriate for the UK banking sector to increase its level of capitalisation.
As a consequence of the recapitalisation of HBOS and the impact of the deteriorating market conditions the terms of the final agreed offer were revised down to a ratio of 0.605 per HBOS share.
As the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired was greater than the total consideration paid, negative goodwill arose on the acquisition.
The negative goodwill was recognised as a Gain on acquisition in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2009.
In accordance with accounting requirements, the measurement period for the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities ended on 15 January 2010 one year from the date of acquisition : no further fair value adjustments were made beyond those reflected in the Groups 31 December 2009 financial statements.

The fair value of the Lloyds Banking Group preference shares issued was deducted from the net assets acquired for the purposes of calculating the gain arising on acquisition.
2 The calculation of consideration was based on the closing price of Lloyds TSB ordinary shares of 98.4p on 16 January 2009: 12,852 million HBOS shares were exchanged for Lloyds Banking Group shares at a ratio of 0.605 shares per HBOS share.

In the first half of 2010, as a result of a deteriorating market, the Group impaired the oil drilling rigs under construction held by the business by 150 million to reflect their reduced value in use.
This impairment was recognised in the Wholesale segment.
In the second half of 2010, the Group reached agreement to dispose of its interests in the two wholly-owned subsidiary companies through which this business operates: the sale was completed in January 2011.
These companies, which had gross assets of 860 million, were sold to Seadrill Limited: a loss of 365 million arose on disposal.
The Group extended vendor financing, on normal commercial terms and negotiated on an arms length basis, to Seadrill to facilitate the acquisition of the rig holding companies.
The loan is not contingent on the performance of the oil rigs under construction.
Accordingly, as at 31 December 2010, the subsidiaries were derecognised.

For the calculation of diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, if any, that arise in respect of share options and awards granted to employees.
The number of shares that could have been acquired at the average annual share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined.
This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.
In December 2009, as part of the Groups recapitalisation and exit from the Government Asset Protection Scheme, the Group entered into an agreement with holders of certain existing liabilities to exchange these for ordinary shares or for cash on 18 February 2010.
The weighted average number of anti-dilutive shares arising from this transaction that have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 294 million at 31 December 2009.
On 18 February 2010, the above exchange completed and 3,141 million new ordinary shares in Lloyds Banking Group plc were issued.
The weighted-average number of anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 92 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 393 million.

The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value, cash flow and net investment hedge approaches as described in note 56: and Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds, Derivatives are classified as trading except those designated as effective hedging instruments which meet the criteria under IAS 39.
Derivatives are held at fair value on the Groups balance sheet.
A description of the methodology used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments and the effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions for those derivatives valued using unobservable inputs is set out in note 55.
The principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows: Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.
Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future.
An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.
Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options.
A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies: the exchange of principal can be notional or actual.
A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.
Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk.
A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place.
The Group also uses credit default swaps to securitise, in combination with external funding, 4,149 million 2009: 6,455 million of corporate and commercial banking loans.
Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity based retail product activity to eliminate the Groups exposure to fluctuations in various international stock exchange indices.
Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date.

The goodwill held in the Groups balance sheet is tested at least annually for impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit: of the total balance of 2,016 million 31 December 2009: 2,016 million, 1,836 million or 91 per cent of the total has been allocated to Scottish Widows in the Groups Insurance division and 170 million or 8 per cent of the total to Asset Finance in the Groups Wholesale division.
The recoverable amount of Scottish Widows has been based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period, and a discount rate of 12 per cent gross of tax.
The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity.
The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 3 per cent growth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.
In 2009, the markets in which the Consumer Finance unit of Asset Finance operates had deteriorated further with both macroeconomic and market conditions worsening, leading to a fall off in demand and increasing arrears.
This, together with continuing uncertainties over the likely short-term macroeconomic environment, had resulted in a reassessment of the carrying value of the consumer finance cash generating unit and the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge of 240 million during 2009, reflecting the write down of the entire balance of goodwill allocated to the Consumer Finance unit of Asset Finance and leaving goodwill of 170 million in the Autolease unit of Asset Finance.
The recoverable amount of Asset Finance has also been based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period and a discount rate of 15 per cent gross of tax.
The cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 0.5 per cent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which Asset Finance participates.

Economic variance is the element of earnings which is generated from changes to economic experience in the period and to economic assumptions over time.
The presentation of economic variance includes the impact of financial market conditions being different at the end of the reporting period from those included in assumptions used to calculate new and existing business returns.
The principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below: ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
In practice, to achieve the same result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the certainty equivalent approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate.
A market consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date.
The risk-free rate used for the value of financial options and guarantees is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant government bond yield curve in line with FSA realistic balance sheet assumptions.
Further information on options and guarantees can be found on page 107.
The liabilities in respect of the Groups UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds.
The value of the in-force business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of these corporate bond holdings.
The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 75 basis points as at 31 December 2010 31 December 2009: 75 basis points.
The risk-free rate assumed in valuing the non-annuity in-force business is the 15 year government bond yield for the appropriate territory.
The risk-free rate assumed in valuing the in-force asset for the UK annuity business is presented as a single risk-free rate to allow a better comparison to the rate used for other business.
That single risk-free rate has been derived to give the equivalent value to the UK annuity book, had that book been valued using the UK gilt yield curve increased to reflect the illiquidity premium described above.
The table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31 December for UK business: 2010 2009 % % Risk-free rate value of in-force non-annuity business 3.99 4.45 Risk-free rate value of in-force annuity business 4.66 5.05 Risk-free rate financial options and guarantees 0.63 to 4.50 0.87 to 4.76 Retail price inflation 3.56 3.64 Expense inflation 4.20 4.42 196 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 VALUE OF IN-FORCE BUSINESS continued NON-MARKET RISK s An allowance for non-market risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for non-market risk is required.
However, in the case of operational risk, reinsurer default and the with-profit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.
NON-ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS Future mortality, morbidity, lapse and paid-up rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on managements view of future experience.
These assumptions are intended to represent a best estimate of future experience.
Further information about the effect of changes in key assumptions is given in note 39.

At 31 December 2010 there was a cumulative 11 million increase in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit spread risk: this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of Lloyds TSB Bank plc, the issuing entity within the Group.
Of the 11 million increase, none arose in 2010 and 11 million arose in 2009.
Liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss represent debt securities in issue which either contain substantive embedded derivatives which would otherwise need to be recognised and measured at fair value separately from the related debt securities, or which are accounted for at fair value to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch.

The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the with-profit funds is to provide a long-term smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against short-term market fluctuations.
With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90 per cent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance.
The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at maturity.
II METHOD OF CALCULATION OF LIABILITIES With-profit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are: With-profit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for with-profit policies: Cost of options and guarantees: Deductions levied against asset shares: Planned enhancements to with-profits benefits reserve: and Impact of the smoothing policy.
The realistic assessment is carried out using a stochastic simulation model which values liabilities on a market consistent basis.
The calculation of realistic liabilities uses best estimate assumptions for mortality, persistency rates and expenses.
These are calculated in a similar manner to those used for the value of in-force business as discussed in note 30.

This is achieved by the use of a valuation model which values liabilities on a basis calibrated to tradable market option contracts and other observable market data.
The with-profit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the risk-free yield and all cash flows are discounted using the risk-free yield.
The risk-free yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant government bond yield curve.
Further information on significant options and guarantees is given on page 107.
Guaranteed annuity option take-up rates Certain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract.
For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take up rates of other options.
The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.
Investment volatility The calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.
Mortality The mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.
Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques.
As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a best estimate view of what persistency will be.
In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
Non-profit fund liabilities I BUSINESS DESCRIPTION The Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds.
Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.
Unit-linked business This includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.
Life insurance The policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts.
Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.
Annuities The policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.
German insurance business is written through the Groups subsidiary Heidelberger Leben and comprises policies similar to the UK definitions above, except that there is participation by the policyholder in the investment, insurance and expense profits of Heidelberger Leben.
A minimum level of policyholder participation is prescribed by German law.
The following types of life insurance contracts are written: Traditional and unit linked endowment or pensions business: and Life insurance business.
II METHOD OF CALCULATION OF LIABILITIES The non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and consistent with the approach required by regulatory rules.
The methods used involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
202 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 38 LIABILITIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS continued III ASSUMPTIONS Generally, assumptions used to value non-profit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation.
This margin for adverse deviation is based on managements judgement and reflects managements views on the inherent level of uncertainty.
The key assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are: Interest rates The rates used are derived in accordance with the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies.
These limit the rates of interest that can be used by reference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuation date.
Margins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates.
These are derived from the limits in the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.
Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.
For German business appropriate industry tables have been considered.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates are allowed for on some non-profit fund contracts.
The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.
Maintenance expenses Allowance is made for future policy costs explicitly.
Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation.
Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.
For German business appropriate cost assumptions have been set in accordance with the rules of the local regulatory body.
Key changes in assumptions A detailed review of the Groups assumptions in 2010 resulted in the following key impacts on profit before tax: Change in persistency assumptions 38 million decrease Change in the assumption in respect of future mortality rates 40 million increase These amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.

Assumptions are intended to be neutral estimates of the most likely or expected outcome.
There has been no significant change in the assumptions and methodologies used for setting reserves.
The reserving methodology and associated assumptions are set out below: The unearned premium reserve is determined on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of each contract.
Claims outstanding comprise those claims that have been notified and those that have been incurred but not reported.
Claims incurred but not reported are determined based on the historical emergence of claims and their average cost.
The notified claims element represents the best estimate of the cost of claims reported using projections and estimates based on historical experience.
The movements in non-life insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets over the year have been as follows: Gross Reinsurance Net m m m Provisions for unearned premiums At 1 January 2009 472 472 Adjustment on acquisition 487 4 483 Increase in the year 1,267 101 1,166 Release in the year 1,438 75 1,363 Change in provision for unearned premiums charged to income statement note 8 171 26 197 Exchange and other adjustments 1 1 At 31 December 2009 788 31 757 Increase in the year 1,230 104 1,126 Release in the year 1,386 113 1,273 Change in provision for unearned premiums charged to income statement note 8 156 9 147 Exchange and other adjustments At 31 December 2010 632 22 610 204 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 38 LIABILITIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS continued These provisions represent the liability for short-term insurance contracts for which the Groups obligations are not expired at the year end.

206 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 39 LIFE INSURANCE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The following table demonstrates the effect of changes in key assumptions on profit before tax and equity disclosed in these financial statements assuming that the other assumptions remain unchanged.
In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
These amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The impact is shown in one direction but can be assumed to be reasonably symmetrical.

1 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing mortality and morbidity rates on non-annuity business to 95 per cent of the expected rate.
2 This sensitivity shows the impact on the annuity and deferred annuity business of reducing mortality rates to 95 per cent of the expected rate.
3 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing lapse and surrender rates to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
4 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing maintenance expenses and investment expenses to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
5 This sensitivity shows the impact on the value of in-force business, financial options and guarantee costs, statutory reserves and asset values of reducing the risk-free rate by 25 basis points.
6 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 5 per cent addition to the expected rate.
7 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 1 per cent addition to the expected rate.
8 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values.
Government bond yields, the risk-free rate and illiquidity premia are all assumed to be unchanged.
9 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 10 basis point increase in the allowance for illiquidity premia.
It assumes the overall corporate bond spreads are unchanged and hence market values are unchanged.
Government bond yields and the non-annuity risk-free rate are both assumed to be unchanged.
The increased illiquidity premium increases the annuity risk-free rate.

These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a percentage of final salary depending upon the length of service: the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31 December 2010 was generally 55 although certain categories of member are deemed to have a contractual right to retire at 50.
The latest full valuations of the two Lloyds TSB schemes were carried out as at 30 June 2008: the latest full valuation of the HBOS scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2008.
The results have been updated to 31 December 2010 by qualified independent actuaries.
The last full valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31 December 2010 by qualified independent actuaries or, in the case of the Scottish Widows Retirement Benefits Scheme, by a qualified actuary employed by Scottish Widows.
The Groups obligations in respect of its defined benefit schemes are funded.
During 2009, the Groups contributions to its defined benefit schemes of 1,859 million included one-off contributions to the Lloyds TSB Group Pension Scheme No 1 and Lloyds TSB Group Pension Scheme No 2 of approximately 1 billion in aggregate.
These contributions took the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which contained assets of approximately 5 billion in aggregate entitling the schemes to annual payments of approximately 215 million in aggregate until 31 December 2014.
Thereafter, assuming that all distributions have been made, the value of the partnership interests will equate to a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2010, the limited liability partnerships held assets of approximatey 4.9 billion: cash payments of 215 million were made to the pension schemes during the year.
The limited liability partnerships are fully consolidated in the Groups balance sheet see note 23.
The Group currently expects to pay contributions of approximately 625 million to its defined benefit schemes in 2011.

The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 as at 31 December 2010 is assumed to live for, on average, 27.2 years for a male and 28.3 years for a female.
In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members.
It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now.
This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve.
To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60.

The expected return on plan assets was determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields at the balance sheet date at a term and credit rating broadly appropriate for the bonds held.
Expected returns on equity and property investments are long-term rates based on the views of the plans independent investment consultants.
The expected return on equities allows for the different expected returns from the private equity, infrastructure and hedge fund investments held by some of the funded plans.
Some of the funded plans also invest in certain money market instruments and the expected return on these investments has been assumed to be the same as cash.

In addition to this, during the second half of the year there was a change in the commutation factors in certain defined benefit schemes.
The combined effect of these changes is a reduction in the Groups defined benefit obligation of 1,081 million and a reduction in the Groups unrecognised actuarial losses of 171 million, resulting in a net curtailment gain of 910 million recognised in the income statement and an equivalent reduction in the balance sheet liability.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally the defined contribution sections of the Lloyds TSB Group Pension Schemes Nos 1 and 2.
During the year ended 31 December 2010 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 173 million 2009: 208 million, representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each schemes rules.
OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits and concessionary mortgages to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants.
The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees and their dependants who retired prior to 1 January 1996.
The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.
For the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 30 June 2008: this valuation has been updated to 31 December 2010 by qualified independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 7.54 per cent 2009: 7.33 per cent.

2 Act 2010 includes legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28 per cent to 27 per cent with effect from 1 April 2011.
This resulted in a reduction in the Groups net deferred tax asset at 31 December 2010 of 132 million.
The proposed further reductions in the rate of corporation tax by 1 per cent per annum to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year starting in 2011.
The effect of these further changes upon the Groups deferred tax balances and leasing business cannot be reliably quantified at this stage.
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Group companies have recognised deferred tax assets of 6,572 million 2009: 5,925 million in relation to trading tax losses carried forward.
After reviews of medium-term profit forecasts, the Group considers that there will be sufficient profits in the future against which these losses will be offset.
Deferred tax assets of 396 million 31 December 2009: 487 million have not been recognised in respect of capital losses carried forward as there are no predicted future capital profits.
Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets of 227 million 31 December 2009: 349 million have not been recognised in respect of trading losses carried forward, mainly in certain overseas companies as there are limited predicted future trading profits.
Trading losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unrelieved foreign tax carried forward as at 31 December 2010 of 62 million 31 December 2009: 53 million, as there are no predicted future taxable profits against which the unrelieved foreign tax credits can be utilised.
These tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES Future transfers from Scottish Widows plcs long-term business funds to its Shareholder Fund will be subject to a shareholder tax charge.
Under IAS 12, no provision is required to be made to the extent that the timing of such transfers is under Scottish Widows plcs control.
Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities of 90 million 2009: 90 million have not been recognised.
Scottish Widows plc has a taxable difference of 152 million 2009: 152 million in respect of its holding of a life insurance subsidiary.
No deferred tax liability is required to be recognised in respect of this taxable temporary difference under IAS 12 as Scottish Widows plc does not intend to dispose of this subsidiary company.

CUSTOMER REMEDIATION PROVISIONS The Group establishes provisions for the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers in respect of past product sales, in those cases where the original sales processes have been found to be deficient.
During 2010 management has again reviewed the adequacy of the provisions held having regard to current complaint volumes and the level of payments being made and 83 million has been charged to the income statement.
At 31 December 2010 the remaining provisions held relate to past sales of a number of products, including mortgage endowment policies, sold through the branch networks.
CUSTOMER GOODWILL PAYMENTS Lloyds Banking Group has been in discussion with the FSA regarding the application of an interest variation clause in certain Bank of Scotland plc variable rate mortgage contracts where the wording in the offer documents received by certain customers had the potential to cause confusion.
The relevant mortgages were written between 2004 and 2007 by Bank of Scotland plc under the Halifax brand.
In February 2011, the Group reached agreement with the FSA in relation to initiating a customer review and contact programme and making goodwill payments to affected customers.
In order to make these goodwill payments, Bank of Scotland plc has applied for a Voluntary Variation of Permission to carry out the customer review and contact programme to bring it within section 404F 7 of FSMA 2000.
The Group has made a provision of 500 million in relation to this programme.
RESTRUCTURING Provisions are made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes irrevocably committed to the expenditure.
VACANT LEASEHOLD PROPERTY Vacant leasehold property provisions are made by reference to a prudent estimate of expected sub-let income, compared to the head rent, and the possibility of disposing of the Groups interest in the lease, taking into account conditions in the property market.
These provisions are reassessed on a biennial basis and will normally run off over the period of under-recovery of the leases concerned, currently averaging five years: where a property is disposed of earlier than anticipated, any remaining balance in the provision relating to that property is released.
OTHER Other provisions include the provisions which the Group carries in respect of its obligations arising from the liquidation of UIC Insurance Company Limited UIC.
The Group has indemnified a third party against losses arising from a reinsurance contract written by UIC which is subject to asbestos and pollution claims in the US.
The ultimate cost and timing of payments under the indemnity remain uncertain.
The provision held represents managements current best estimate of the cost after having regard to actuarial estimates of future losses.

The subordination of specific subordinated liabilities is determined in respect of the issuer and any guarantors of that liability.
The claims of holders of preferred shares and securities are generally junior to those of the holders of undated subordinated liabilities, which in turn are junior to the claims of holders of the dated subordinated liabilities.
The subordination of the dated enhanced capital notes ranks equally with that of the dated subordinated liabilities.
The Group has not had any defaults of principal, interest or other breaches with respect to its subordinated liabilities during the year 2009: none.
No repayment or purchase by the issuer of the subordinated liabilities may be made prior to their stated maturity without the consent of the Financial Services Authority.

3 SHARE CAPITAL AND CONTROL There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company other than as set out in the articles of association and: certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by law and regulations for example, insider trading laws : pursuant to the UK Listing Authoritys listing rules where directors and certain employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Companys shares: and pursuant to the rules of some of the Companys employee share plans where certain restrictions may apply while the shares are subject to the plans.
Where, under an employee share plan operated by the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant.
Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
In addition, the Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and or voting rights.
Information regarding significant direct or indirect holdings of shares in the Company can be found on page 284.
The directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and preference shares as granted at the annual general meeting on 6 May 2010.
The authority to issue shares and the authority to make market purchases of shares will expire at the annual general meeting.
Shareholders will be asked, at the annual general meeting, to give similar authorities.
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present and entitled to vote has one vote for every share held.
Further details regarding voting at the annual general meeting can be found in the notes to the notice of the annual general meeting.
Ordinary shares The holders of ordinary shares excluding the limited voting ordinary shares, who held 99.9 per cent of the total ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2010, are entitled to receive the Companys report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights.
Holders of ordinary shares excluding the limited voting ordinary shares may also receive a dividend subject to the provisions of the Companys articles of association and the restrictions noted below and on a winding up may share in the assets of the Company.
224 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 47 SHARE CAPITAL continued In November 2009, as part of the restructuring plan that was a requirement for European Commission approval of state aid received by the Group, the Group agreed to suspend the payment of coupons and dividends on certain of the Groups preference shares and preferred securities for the two-year period from 31 January 2010 to 31 January 2012.
Consequently, the terms of these instruments prevent the Company from making dividend payments on ordinary shares.
Limited voting ordinary shares The limited voting ordinary shares are held by the Lloyds TSB Foundations the Foundations.
The holders of the limited voting ordinary shares, who held 0.1 per cent of the total ordinary shares as at 31 December 2010, are entitled to receive copies of every circular or other document sent out by the Company to the holders of other ordinary shares.
These shares carry no rights to dividends but rank pari passu with the ordinary shares in respect of other distributions and in the event of winding up.
These shares do not have any right to vote at general meetings other than on resolutions concerning acquisitions or disposals of such importance that they require shareholder consent, or for the winding up of the Company, or for a variation in the class rights of the limited voting ordinary shares.
In the event of an offer for more than 50 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, each limited voting ordinary share will convert into an ordinary share and shall rank equally with the ordinary shares in all respects from the date of conversion.
Preference shares The Company has in issue various classes of preference shares which are all classified as liabilities under IFRS and details of which are shown in note 46.

A total share premium of 1,808 million was recorded in respect of these transactions.
2 Distributable reserves of 1,000 million arose on the issue of preference shares in January 2009 which were classified as debt.
In June 2009, these preference shares were redeemed out of the proceeds of the placing and compensatory open offer of ordinary shares and the distributable element of this issue was transferred from the share premium account to the merger reserve.
3 In January 2010, the Company repurchased and cancelled certain preference shares amounting to 14 million.
This resulted in a transfer of 3 million from the merger reserve to the capital redemption reserve and a transfer of 11 million from the merger reserve to the share premium account.
In December 2009, the Group redeemed eight issues of preference shares in exchange for the issuance of enhanced capital notes.
This resulted in a transfer of 26 million from the merger reserve to the capital redemption reserve and a transfer of 2,684 million from the merger reserve to the share premium account.

LLOYDS BANKING GROUP EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES The executive share option schemes were long-term incentive schemes available to certain senior executives of the Group, with grants usually made annually.
Options were granted within limits set by the rules of the schemes relating to the number of shares under option and the price payable on the exercise of options.
The last grant of executive options was made in August 2005.
These options were granted without a performance multiplier and the maximum limit for the grant of options in normal circumstances was three times annual salary.
Between April 2001 and August 2004, the aggregate value of the award based upon the market price at the date of grant could not exceed four times the executives annual remuneration and, normally, the limit for the grant of options to an executive in any one year would be equal to 1.5 times annual salary with a maximum performance multiplier of 3.5.
Prior to 18 April 2001, the normal limit was equal to one years remuneration and no performance multiplier was applied.
Performance conditions for executive options FOR OPTIONS GRANTED UP TO MARCH 2001 The performance condition was that growth in earnings per share must be equal to the aggregate percentage change in the Retail Prices Index plus three percentage points for each complete year of the relevant period together with a further condition that Lloyds Banking Group plcs ranking based on total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price over the relevant period should be in the top fifty companies of the FTSE 100.
The relevant period for the performance conditions began at the end of the financial year preceding the date of grant and continued until the end of the third subsequent year following commencement or, if not met, the end of such later year in which the conditions were met.
Once the conditions were satisfied the options remained exercisable without further conditions.
If they were not satisfied by the tenth anniversary of the grant the options would lapse.
FOR OPTIONS GRANTED FROM AUGUST 2001 TO AUGUST 2004 The performance condition was linked to the performance of Lloyds Banking Group plcs total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price against a comparator group of 17 companies including Lloyds Banking Group plc.
The performance condition was measured over a three year period which commenced at the end of the financial year preceding the grant of the option and continued until the end of the third subsequent year.
If the performance condition was not then met, it was measured at the end of the fourth financial year.
If the condition was not then met, the options would lapse.
To meet the performance conditions, the Groups ranking against the comparator group was required to be at least ninth.
The full grant of options only became exercisable if the Group was ranked first.
A performance multiplier of between nil and 100 per cent was applied below this level to calculate the number of shares in respect of which options granted to Executive Directors would become exercisable, and were calculated on a sliding scale.
If Lloyds Banking Group plc was ranked below median the options would not be exercisable.
Options granted to senior executives other than Executive Directors were not so highly leveraged and, as a result, different performance multipliers were applied to their options.
For the majority of executives, options were granted with the performance condition but with no performance multiplier.
Options granted in 2004 became exercisable as the performance condition was met on the re-test.
The performance condition vested at 14 per cent for Executive Directors, 24 per cent for Managing Directors, and 100 per cent for all other executives.
FOR OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2005 The same conditions applied as for grants made up to August 2004, except that: the performance condition was linked to the performance of Lloyds Banking Group plcs total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price against a comparator group of 15 companies including Lloyds Banking Group plc: if the performance condition was not met at the end of the third subsequent year, the options would lapse: and the full grant of options became exercisable only if the Group was ranked in the top four places of the comparator group.
A sliding scale applied between fourth and eighth positions.
If Lloyds Banking Group was ranked below the median ninth or below the options would lapse.
Options granted in 2005 became exercisable as the performance condition was met when tested.
The performance condition vested at 82.5 per cent for all options granted.

Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the plan, with the limits determining the maximum number of shares that can be awarded equating to three times annual salary.
In exceptional circumstances this may increase to four times annual salary.
The performance conditions for awards made in March and August 2007 are as follows: i For 50 per cent of the award the EPS Award the percentage increase in earnings per share of the Group on a compound annualised basis over the relevant period needed to be at least an average of 6 percentage points per annum greater than the percentage increase if any in the Retail Prices Index over the same period.
If it was less than 3 per cent per annum the EPS Award would lapse.
If the increase was more than 3 per cent but less than 6 per cent per annum then the proportion of shares released would be on a straight line basis between 17.5 per cent and 100 per cent.
The relevant period commenced on 1 January 2007 and ended on 31 December 2009. ii For the other 50 per cent of the award the TSR Award it was necessary for the Groups total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price to exceed the median of a comparator group 14 companies over the relevant period by an average of 7.5 per cent per annum for the TSR Award to vest in full.
17.5 per cent of the TSR Award would vest where the Groups total shareholder return was equal to median and vesting would occur on a straight line basis in between these points.
Where the Groups total shareholder return was below the median of the comparator group, the TSR Award would lapse.
The relevant period commenced on 8 March 2007 and ended on 7 March 2010.
As a consequence of the acquisition of HBOS and the general market turmoil, in March 2009 the Remuneration Committee decided that the performance test for the 2007 awards should be based on the performance of the Group up to 17 September 2008, the date prior to the announcement of the HBOS acquisition.
The performance test was on a fair value basis, on the estimated probability, as at that date, of achieving the performance conditions.
As a consequence, for all participants, other than those who were Executive Directors at the time the award was granted and a small number of other senior executives, the share awards vested at 31 per cent in March 2010.
The performance conditions for awards made in March, April and August 2008 are as follows: i For 50 per cent of the award the EPS Award the performance condition is as described for the 2007 awards with the relevant performance period commencing on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2010. ii For the other 50 per cent of the award the TSR Award the performance condition is as described for the 2007 awards, except that the comparator group comprises of 13 companies, with the relevant performance period commencing on 6 March 2008 the date of the first award and ending on 5 March 2011.
The current LTIP rules allow for awards to be made of up to 400 per cent of base salary.
Under normal circumstances awards are made of 300 per cent of salary with the additional 100 per cent available for circumstances that the Remuneration Committee deems to be exceptional.
In 2008, awards were made of 375 per cent of base salary to the Group Chief Executive and two of the Executive Directors for retention purposes, and in light of data reviewed by the committee which showed total remuneration to be behind median both for the FTSE 20, and the other major UK banks.
As for the 2007 LTIP awards, as a consequence of the acquisition of HBOS and the general market turmoil, in March 2009 the Remuneration Committee decided that the performance test for the 2008 awards should be based on the performance of the Group up to 17 September 2008, the date prior to the announcement of the HBOS acquisition.
As a consequence, for all participants, other than those who were Executive Directors at the time the award was granted and a small number of other senior executives, the share awards will vest at 29 per cent in March 2011.
The performance conditions for awards made in April, May and September 2009 are as follows: i EPS: relevant to 50 per cent of the award.
Performance will be measured based on EPS growth over a three-year period from the baseline EPS of 2008.
If the growth in EPS reaches 26 per cent, 25 per cent of this element of the award, being the threshold, will vest.
If growth in EPS reaches 36 per cent, 100 per cent of this element will vest.
ii Economic Profit: relevant to 50 per cent of the award.
Performance will be measured based on the extent to which cumulative Economic Profit targets are achieved over the three-year period.
If the absolute improvement in adjusted Economic Profit reaches 100 per cent, 25 per cent of this element of the award, being the threshold, will vest.
If the absolute improvement in adjusted Economic Profit reaches 202 per cent, 100 per cent of this element will vest.
The EPS and economic profit performance measures applying to this 2009 LTIP award were set on the basis that the Group would enter into the Government Asset Protection Scheme.
As the Group is not participating in the Government Asset Protection Scheme, in June 2010 the Remuneration Committee approved restated performance measures on a basis consistent with the EPS and economic profit measures used for the 2010 LTIP awards.
232 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 52 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued An additional discretionary award was made in April, May and September 2009.
The performance conditions for those awards are as follows: i Synergy savings: The release of 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the achievement of target run-rate synergy savings in 2009 and 2010 as well as the achievement of sustainable synergy savings of at least 1.5 billion by the end of 2011.
The award will be broken down into three equally weighted annual tranches.
Performance will be assessed at the end of each year against annual performance targets based on a trajectory to meet the 2011 target.
The extent to which targets have been achieved will determine the proportion of shares to be banked each year.
Any release of shares will be subject to the Remuneration Committee judging the overall success of the delivery of the integration programme.
ii Integration balanced scorecard: The release of the remaining 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the outcome of a Balanced Scorecard of non-financial measures of the success of the integration in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The Balanced scorecard element will be broken down into three equally weighted tranches.
The tranches will be crystallised and banked for each year of the performance cycle subject to separate annual performance targets across the four measurement categories of Building the Business, Customer, Risk and People and Organisation Development.
Performance against the first two years of the award has been assessed and all targets have been met or exceeded.
The performance conditions for awards made in March and August 2010 are as follows: i EPS: relevant to 50 per cent of the award.
Performance will be measured based on EPS growth over a three-year period from the baseline EPS of 2009.
If the absolute improvement in adjusted EPS reaches 158 per cent, 25 per cent of this element of the award, being the threshold, will vest.
If absolute improvement in adjusted EPS reaches 180 per cent, 100 per cent of this element will vest.
Vesting between threshold and maximum will be on a straight line basis.
Performance will be measured based on the compound annual growth rate of adjusted Economic Profit over the three financial years starting on 1 January 2010 relative to an adjusted 2009 Economic Profit base.
If the compounded annual growth rate of adjusted Economic Profit reaches 57 per cent per annum, 25 per cent of this element of the award, being the threshold, will vest.
If the compounded annual growth rate of adjusted Economic Profit reaches 77 per cent per annum, 100 per cent of this element will vest.
For awards made to Executive Directors, a third performance condition was set, relating to Absolute Share Price, relevant to 28 per cent of the award.
Performance will be measured based on the Absolute Share Price on 26 March 2013, being the third anniversary of the award date.
If the share price at the end of the performance period is 75 pence or less, none of this element of the award will vest.
If the share price is 114 pence or higher, 100 per cent of this element will vest.
Vesting between threshold and maximum will be on a straight line basis, provided that shares comprised in the Absolute Share Price element may only be released if both the EPS and Economic Profit performance measures have been satisfied at the threshold level or above.
The EPS and Economic Profit performance conditions will each relate to 36 per cent of the total award.
Conditional awards of shares made under this plan were adjusted on 2 July 2009 as a result of the Placing and Compensatory Open Offer and on 13 August 2010 as a result of the Capitalisation Issue and Rights Issue of 2009.
The adjustments were made, where applicable, using a standard HMRC formula, to negate the dilutionary impact of the above corporate actions.
Performance share plan Under the performance share plan, introduced during 2005, participating executives were eligible for an award of free shares, known as performance shares, to match the bonus shares awarded as part of their 2004 and 2005 bonus.
The maximum match was two performance shares for each bonus share, awarded at the end of a three year period.
The actual number of shares awarded was dependent on the Groups total shareholder return performance measured over a three year period, compared to other companies in the comparator group.
The maximum of two performance shares for each bonus share would be awarded only if the Groups total shareholder return performance placed it first in the comparator group: one performance share for each bonus share would be granted if the Group was placed fifth: and one performance share for every two bonus shares if the Group was placed eighth median.
Between first and fifth position, and fifth and eighth position, sliding scales would apply.
If the total shareholder return performance was below median, no performance shares would be awarded.

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option.
The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market traded options in the Groups shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN Free shares An award of shares may be made annually to employees based on a percentage of each employees salary in the preceding year up to a maximum of 3,000.
The percentage is normally announced concurrently with the Groups annual results and the price of the shares awarded is announced at the time of award.
The shares awarded are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employees behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares.
The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves the Group within this three year period for other than a good reason, all of the shares awarded will be forfeited.
No free shares were awarded in 2009 or 2010.
Matching shares The Group undertakes to match shares purchased by employees up to the value of 30 per month: these shares are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employees behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares.
The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves within this three year period for other than a good reason, 100 per cent of the matching shares are forfeited.
Similarly if the employees sell their purchased shares within three years, their matching shares are forfeited.
The number of shares awarded relating to matching shares in 2010 was 17,411,651 2009: 16,746,310, with an average fair value of 0.63 2009: 0.69, based on market prices at the date of award.

Lending commitments On 23 March 2010, the Company entered into a deed poll in favour of HM Treasury, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Departments for Communities and Local Government confirming its lending commitments for the 12 month period commencing 1 March 2010.
The Company agreed, subject to, amongst other things, sufficient customer demand, to provide gross new lending to UK businesses of 44,000 million and to adjust the undertakings but not the level of lending agreed in 2009 given in connection with lending to homeowners for the 12 month period.
This additional lending is expressed to be subject to the Groups prevailing commercial terms and conditions including pricing and risk assessment and, in relation to mortgage lending, the Groups standard credit and other acceptance criteria.
Credit Guarantee Scheme HM Treasury launched the Credit Guarantee Scheme in October 2008 as part of a range of measures announced by the UK Government intended to ease the turbulence in the UK banking system.
It charges a commercial fee for the guarantee of new short and medium-term debt issuance.
The fee payable to HM Treasury on guaranteed issues is based on a per annum rate of 50 basis points plus the median five-year credit default swap spread.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had 45,308 million 2009: 49,954 million of debt issued under the Credit Guarantee Scheme.
During 2010, the Group redeemed 4,987 million of bonds.
The Groups income statement includes fees of 454 million 2009: 498 million payable to HM Treasury in respect of guaranteed funding.
There were no other material transactions between the Group and HM Treasury during 2010 that were not made in the ordinary course of business or that were unusual in their nature or conditions.
OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Pensions funds The Group provides banking and some investment management services to certain of the Group pension funds.
At 31 December 2010, customer deposits of 64 million 2009: 99 million and investment and insurance contract liabilities of 850 million 2009: 691 million related to the Groups pension funds.
Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs The Group manages 402 2009: 382 OEICs, and of these 111 2009: 108 are consolidated.
The Group invested 1,460 million 2009: 1,271 million and redeemed 982 million 2009: 1,076 million in the unconsolidated OEICs during the year and had investments, at fair value, of 7,920 million 2009: 6,954 million at 31 December.
The Group earned fees of 271 million from the unconsolidated OEICs 2009: 217 million.
The Company held no investments in OEICs at any time during 2009 or 2010.
Joint ventures and associates The Group provides both administration and processing services to its principal joint venture, Sainsburys Bank plc.
The amounts receivable by the Group during the year were 31 million 2009: 34 million, of which 8 million was outstanding at 31 December 2010 2009: 10 million.
At 31 December 2010, Sainsburys Bank plc also had balances with the Group that were included in loans and advances to banks of 1,277 million 2009: 1,218 million and deposits by banks of 1,358 million 2009: 1,405 million.
At 31 December 2010 there were loans and advances to customers of 5,660 million 2009: 12,235 million outstanding and balances within customer deposits of 151 million 2009: 254 million relating to other joint ventures and associates.
In addition to the above balances, the Group has a number of other associates held by its venture capital business that it accounts for at fair value through profit or loss.
At 31 December 2010, these companies had total assets of approximately 12,216 million 2009: 14,840 million, total liabilities of approximately 11,937million 2009: 15,300 million and for the year ended 31 December 2010 had turnover of approximately 3,829 million 2009: 10,570 million and made a net profit of approximately 182 million 2009: net loss of 572 million.

At the same time, it commenced a market study into wider questions about competition and price transparency in the provision of personal current accounts.
The Supreme Court published its judgment in respect of the fairness of unarranged overdraft charges on personal current accounts on 25 November 2009, finding in favour of the litigant banks.
On 22 December 2009, the OFT announced that it will not continue its investigation into the fairness of these charges.
The Group is working with the regulators to ensure that outstanding customer complaints are concluded as quickly as possible and anticipates that most cases in the county courts will be discontinued.
The Group expects that some customers will argue that despite the test case ruling they are entitled to a refund of unarranged overdraft charges on the basis of other legal arguments or challenges.
It is not practicable to quantify the claims.
The Group is robustly defending any such complaints or claims and does not expect any such complaints or claims to have a material adverse effect on the Group.
The OFT however continued to discuss its concerns in relation to the personal current account market with the banks, consumer groups and other organisations under the auspices of its Market Study into personal current accounts.
In October 2009, the OFT published voluntary initiatives agreed with the industry and consumer groups to improve transparency of the costs and benefits of personal current accounts and improvements to the switching process.
On 16 March 2010 the OFT published a further update announcing several further voluntary industry wide initiatives to improve a customers ability to control whether they used an unarranged overdraft and to assist those in financial difficulty.
However, in light of the progress it noted in the unarranged overdraft market since July 2007 and the progress it expects to see over the next two years, it has decided to take no further action at this time and will review the unarranged overdraft market again in 2012.
INTERCHANGE FEES The European Commission has adopted a formal decision finding that an infringement of European Commission competition laws has arisen from arrangements whereby MasterCard issuers charged a uniform fallback interchange fee in respect of cross-border transactions in relation to the use of a MasterCard or Maestro branded payment card.
The European Commission has required that the fee be reduced to zero for relevant cross-border transactions within the European Economic Area.
This decision has been appealed to the General Court of the European Union the General Court.
Lloyds TSB Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc along with certain other MasterCard issuers have successfully applied to intervene in the appeal in support of MasterCards position that the arrangements for the charging of a uniform fallback interchange fee are compatible with European Commission competition laws.
MasterCard has announced that it has reached an understanding with the European Commission on a new methodology for calculating intra-European Economic Area multi-lateral interchange fees on an interim basis pending the outcome of the appeal.
Meanwhile, the European Commission and the UKs OFT are pursuing investigations with a view to deciding whether arrangements adopted by other payment card schemes for the levying of uniform fallback interchange fees in respect of domestic and or cross-border payment transactions also infringe European Commission and or UK competition laws.
As part of this initiative, the OFT will also intervene in the General Court appeal supporting the European Commissions position and Visa reached an agreement with the European Commission to reduce the level of interchange for crossborder debit card transactions to the interim levels agreed by MasterCard.
The ultimate impact of the investigations on the Group can only be known at the conclusion of these investigations and any relevant appeal proceedings.
PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE There has been extensive scrutiny of the Payment Protection Insurance PPI market in recent years.
In October 2010, the UK Competition Commission Competition Commission confirmed its decision to prohibit the active sale of PPI by a distributor to a customer within seven days of a sale of credit.
This followed the completion of its formal investigation into the supply of PPI services other than store card PPI to non-business customers in the UK in January 2009 and a referral of the proposed prohibition to the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Following an earlier decision to stop selling single premium PPI products, the Group ceased to offer PPI products to its customers in July 2010.
On 1 July 2008, the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS referred concerns regarding the handling of PPI complaints to the Financial Services Authority FSA as an issue of wider implication.
On 29 September 2009 and 9 March 2010, the FSA issued consultation papers on PPI complaints handling.
The FSA proposed new guidance on the fair assessment of a complaint and the calculation of redress and a new rule requiring firms to reassess historically rejected complaints.
The FSA published its Policy Statement on 10 August 2010, setting out a new set of rules for PPI complaints handling and redress which had to be implemented by 1 December 2010.
On 8 October 2010, the British Bankers Association BBA, the principal trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector, filed an application for permission to seek judicial review against the FSA and the FOS.
The BBA is seeking an order quashing the FSA Policy Statement and an order quashing the decision of the FOS to determine PPI sales in accordance with the guidance published on its website in November 2008.
The Judicial hearing was held in late January 2011 and the judgment which may be subject to appeal is expected shortly.
This legal challenge has affected the implementation of the Policy Statement, since the challenge has called into question the standards to be applied when assessing PPI complaints.
As a result of that challenge, a large number of complaints cannot be decided until the outcome of the legal challenge is clear and implemented.
The ultimate impact on the Group of the FSAs complaints handling policy if implemented in full and the FOSs most recent approach to PPI complaints could be material to the Groups financial position, although the precise effect can only be assessed once the legal proceedings have been finally determined and the steps the Group may be required to take identified and implemented.
In addition, it is not practicable to quantify the potential financial impact of the implementation of the Policy Statement given the material uncertainties around, for example, applicable time 238 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 54 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS continued periods, the extent of application of root cause analysis, the treatment of evidence and the ultimate emergence period for complaints, driven in large part by the activities of the claims management companies, all of which will significantly affect complaints volumes, uphold rates and redress costs.
No provision has been made in these financial statements to reflect implementation of the FSAs complaint handling policy in its current form.
Following concerns expressed by the FSA, it announced in its statement on 29 September 2009 that several firms had agreed to carry out reviews of past sales of single premium loan protection insurance.
Lloyds Banking Group has agreed in principle that it will undertake a review in relation to sales of single premium loan protection insurance made through its branch network since 1 July 2007.
The precise details of the review are still being discussed with the FSA.
The ultimate impact on Lloyds Banking Group of any review could be material but can only be known at the conclusion of these discussions.
US SANCTIONS In January 2009 Lloyds TSB Bank plc announced the settlement it had reached with the US Department of Justice and the New York County District Attorneys Office in relation to their investigations into historic US dollar payment practices involving countries, persons or entities subject to the economic sanctions administered by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC.
On 22 December 2009 OFAC announced the settlement it had reached with Lloyds TSB Bank plc in relation to its investigation and confirmed that the settlement sum due to OFAC had been fully satisfied by Lloyds TSB Bank plcs payment to the Department of Justice and the New York County District Attorneys Office.
No further enforcement actions are expected in relation to the matters set out in the settlement agreements.
On 26 February 2009 a purported shareholder filed a derivative civil action in the Supreme Court of New York, Nassau County against certain current and former directors, and nominally against Lloyds TSB Bank plc and Lloyds Banking Group plc, seeking various forms of relief.
The derivative action is at an early stage and settlement is being discussed and the ultimate outcome is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
EUROPEAN UNION GENDER DIRECTIVE An opt-out clause to the European Union Gender Directive currently permits insurers to take gender into account as a risk factor when pricing contracts.
In March 2011, the European Court of Justice is expected to rule on whether this infringes fundamental European rights for equal treatment.
If the European Court of Justice rules that the opt-out clause does infringe such rights, it could alter the market and alter prices for insurance products to a significant extent.
At the date of these financial statements, no provision has been made for the potential costs of rectifying contracts in existence at 31 December 2010, should this ultimately be required.
The ultimate impact on the Group can only be known following the European Court of Justices ruling.
However, the Group does not expect the final outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial position.
OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS AND REGULATORY MATTERS In the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the FSA in relation to a range of conduct of business matters, especially in relation to retail products including packaged bank accounts, mortgages, structured products and pensions.
The Group is keen to ensure that any regulatory concerns regarding product governance or contract terms are understood and addressed.
The ultimate impact on the Group of these discussions can only be known at the conclusion of such discussions.
In addition, during the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other threatened and actual legal proceedings which may include class action lawsuits brought on behalf of customers, shareholders or other third parties, regulatory investigations, regulatory challenges and enforcement actions, both in the UK and overseas.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisors where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to managements best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, either because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case and no provisions are held against such matters.
However the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial position.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS ARISING FROM THE BANKING BUSINESS Acceptances and endorsements arise where Lloyds Banking Group agrees to guarantee payment on a negotiable instrument drawn up by a customer.
Other items serving as direct credit substitutes include standby letters of credit, or other irrevocable obligations, where Lloyds Banking Group has an irrevocable obligation to pay a third party beneficiary if the customer fails to repay an outstanding commitment: they also include acceptances drawn under letters of credit or similar facilities where the acceptor does not have specific title to an identifiable underlying shipment of goods.
Performance bonds and other transaction-related contingencies which include bid or tender bonds, advance payment guarantees, VAT Customs and Excise bonds and standby letters of credit relating to a particular contract or non-financial transaction are undertakings where the requirement to make payment under the guarantee depends on the outcome of a future event.
Lloyds Banking Groups maximum exposure to loss is represented by the contractual nominal amount detailed in the table below.
Consideration has not been taken of any possible recoveries from customers for payments made in respect of such guarantees under recourse provisions or from collateral held.

Some of these operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rent escalation clauses, although the effect of these is not material.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
CAPITAL COMMITMENTS Excluding commitments in respect of investment property note 28, capital expenditure contracted but not provided for at 31 December 2010 amounted to 339 million 2009: 203 million.
Of this amount, 282 million 2009: 198 million related to assets to be leased to customers under operating leases.
The Groups management is confident that future net revenues and funding will be sufficient to cover these commitments.

Given the long-term nature of this portfolio, the Group concluded that certain of these securities will be able to be held until they reach maturity.
Consequently, on 1 November 2010, government securities with a fair value of 3,601 million were reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to held-to-maturity investments reflecting the Groups positive intent and ability to hold them until maturity.
In 2009, no financial assets were reclassified.
In 2008, in accordance with the amendment to IAS39 that became applicable during that year, the Group reviewed the categorisation of its financial assets classified as held for trading and available-for-sale.
On the basis that there was no longer an active market for some of those assets, which are therefore more appropriately managed as loans, with effect from 1 July 2008, the Group transferred 2,993 million of assets previously classified as held for trading into loans and receivables.
With effect from 1 November 2008, the Group transferred 437 million of assets previously classified as available-for-sale financial assets into loans and receivables.
At the time of these transfers, the Group had the intention and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
As at the date of reclassification, the weighted average effective interest rate of the assets transferred was 6.3 per cent with the estimated recoverable cash flows of 3,524 million.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
Fair value information is not provided for items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument.
These items include intangible assets, such as the value of the Groups branch network, the long-term relationships with depositors and credit card relationships: premises and equipment: and shareholders equity.
These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that the fair value information presented does not represent the underlying value of the Group.
Valuation control framework The key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification.
These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.
Model validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models.
In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted preand post-trading.
Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Groups systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade life cycle.
Post-trade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external sources.
Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value.
The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum.
Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management.
The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.
Formal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, over-the-counter options and the Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA reserve.
244 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 55 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost LOANS AND RECEIVABLES The Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates.
The carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.
For fixed rate lending, several different techniques are used to estimate fair value, as considered appropriate.
For commercial and personal customers, fair value is principally estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions.
The fair value for corporate loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.
Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period.
The fair values of asset-backed securities and secondary loans, which were previously within assets held for trading and were reclassified to loans and receivables, are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.
DEPOSITS FROM BANKS AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS The fair value of deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value.
The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
DEBT SECURITIES IN ISSUE AND SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.
Fair value for other debt securities and for subordinated liabilities is estimated using quoted market prices.
HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS The fair values of government securities are based on market prices.
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value The valuations of financial instruments have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.
LEVEL 1 PORTFOLIOS Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise treasury bills and other government securities.
LEVEL 2 PORTFOLIOS Level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data.
Examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.
LEVEL 3 PORTFOLIOS Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Such instruments would include the Groups venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows.
Certain of the Groups asset-backed securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3.
The table below provides an analysis of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group that are carried at fair value in the Groups consolidated balance sheet, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.

Asset-backed securities are then classified as either level 2 or level 3 depending on whether there is more than one consistent independent source of data.
If there is a single, uncorroborated market source for a significant valuation input or where there are materially inconsistent levels then the security is reported as level 3.
Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise certain residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralised loan obligations and collateralised debt obligations.
Equity investments including venture capital Unlisted equities and fund investments are accounted for as trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or as available-for-sale financial assets.
These investments are valued using different techniques as a result of the variety of investments across the portfolio in accordance with the Groups valuation policy and are calculated using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Depending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.
A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The particular multiple selected being appropriate for the type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple.
Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple.
Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return.
Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple.
For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Groups valuation policy.
Unquoted equities and property partnerships in the life funds Third party valuations are used to obtain the fair value of unquoted investments.
Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary.
Derivatives Where the Groups derivative assets and liabilities are not traded on an exchange, they are valued using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and options pricing models, as appropriate.
The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include: Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models: the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.
Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources.
Credit derivatives, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap CDS curves: the Group uses standard models with observable inputs.
Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities: option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service.
For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data: where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-the-money positions using a market standard consensus pricing service.
Complex interest rate and foreign exchange products where there is significant dispersion of consensus pricing or where implied funding costs are material and unobservable are classified as level 3.
Where credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on asset-backed securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis asset-backed security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying asset-backed security.

The embedded equity conversion feature is valued by comparing the market price of the enhanced capital notes with the market price of similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The latter is calculated by discounting the expected enhanced capital note cash flows in the absence of a conversion using prevailing market yields for similar capital securities without the conversion feature.
The market price of the enhanced capital notes was calculated with reference to multiple broker quotes.
Movements in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in net trading income.
Level 3 derivative assets also include 96 million 31 December 2009: 140 million in respect of credit default swaps written on level 3 negative basis asset-backed securities calculated as set out in the table below: 2010 2009 m m Fair value before credit valuation adjustment 114 346 Less: credit valuation adjustment 18 206 Carrying value 96 140 SENSITIVITY OF LEVEL 3 VALUATIONS Asset-backed securities Reasonably possible alternative valuations have been calculated for asset-backed securities by using alternative pricing sources and calculating an absolute difference.
The pricing difference is defined as the absolute difference between the actual price used and the closest, alternative price available.
Derivative financial instruments i In respect of the embedded equity conversion feature of the enhanced capital notes, the sensitivity was based on the absolute difference between the actual price of the enhanced capital note and the closest, alternative broker quote available plus the impact of applying a 10 bps increase decrease in the market yield used to derive a market price for similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The effect of interdependency of the assumptions is not material to the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions to the valuations of derivative financial instruments.
ii In respect of credit default swaps written on level 3 negative basis asset-backed securities, reasonably possible alternative valuations have been calculated by flexing the spread between the underlying asset and the credit default swap, or adjusting market yields, by a reasonable amount.
The sensitivity is determined by applying a 60 bps increase decrease in the spread between the asset and the credit default swap.
Venture capital and equity investments The valuation techniques used for unlisted equities and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment.
Third party valuers have been used to determine the value of unlisted equities and property partnerships included in the Groups life insurance funds.
As these factors differ for each investment, depending on the nature of the valuation technique used and the inputs, there is no single common factor that could be adjusted to provide a reasonable alternative valuation for these investment portfolios.
250 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 55 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued DERIVATIVE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS Derivative financial instruments which are carried in the balance sheet at fair value are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk, market liquidity and other risks.
i Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments, excluding monoline counterparties The following table summarises the movement on this revaluation adjustment account during 2010.
Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments m At 31 December 2009 662 Income statement charge 20 Transfers 112 At 31 December 2010 570 Represented by: 2010 2009 m m Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA 671 892 Debit Valuation Adjustment DVA 298 230 Funding Valuation Adjustment 197 570 662 Valuation adjustments are applied to the Groups over-the-counter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to standard interbank collateral arrangements.
These valuation adjustments reflect the different credit and funding exposures that such counterparties represent.
A Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA is applied to the Groups over-the-counter uncollateralised derivative exposures to adjust the derivative valuations provided by standard interbank interest rate curves.
The Group uses a bilateral simulation model to develop expected future exposures.
This calculates a CVA for scenarios where the Group has a positive future exposure asset and a Debit Valuation Adjustment DVA where the Group has a negative future exposure liability.
In circumstances where a counterparty becomes impaired, any associated derivative valuation adjustment is transferred and assessed for specific loss alongside other non-derivative assets and liabilities the counterparty may have with the Group.
Market Credit Default Swap CDS spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties.
For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used.
The Loss Given Default LGD is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.
The combination of a one notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a 10 per cent increase in LGD increases the CVA by 120 million.
Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes.
For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis in total contributing 29 million of the overall CVA balance at 31 December 2010.
The Debit Valuation Adjustment DVA is sensitive to the Groups own CDS spread.
A 1 per cent rise in this spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of 65 million to 363 million.
The risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates.
Due to the nature of the Groups business the CVA DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise.
A 1 per cent rise in interest rates would lead to a 109 million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to 461 million.
The CVA model used by the Group does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.
In addition, in 2010 the Group has included a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding certain uncollateralised derivative positions where the Group considers that this cost is included in market pricing.
This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds.
A 10 bps increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by 5 million.
ii Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments monoline counterparties The Group has no significant derivative exposures remaining against monoline counterparties as shown in note 56 3.
The remaining valuation adjustment on these limited positions is shown in the table below.

At 31 December 2010, the Groups derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of 66 million 31 December 2009: 70 million.
iv Libor Overnight Index Swap OIS basis The Groups derivative trading business applies 70 million 31 December 2009: nil of valuation adjustments against the changing market approach to valuing derivatives that are subject to daily collateral margin, where standard market practice is to pay interest on an Overnight Index Swap OIS basis rather than a Libor rate.
No credit valuation adjustment is taken on collateralised swaps 31 December 2009: 25 million.
56 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT As a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Groups activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.
The primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: credit risk: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk: and liquidity risk.
Information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital can be found on pages 65 to 108.
The following additional disclosures, which provide quantitative information about the risks within financial instruments held or issued by the Group, should be read in conjunction with that earlier information.
1 INTEREST RATE RISK In the Groups retail banking business interest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities.
Liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Groups discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the Bank of Englands base rate.
There is a relatively small volume of deposits whose rate is contractually fixed for their term to maturity.
Many banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements: there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities.
However, a significant proportion of the Groups lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed for periods of up to five years or longer.
The Group establishes two types of hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk: fair value hedges and cash flow hedges.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt.
The majority of the Groups hedge accounting relationships are fair value hedges where interest rate swaps are used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in the fixed rate mortgage portfolio.
At 31 December 2010 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was 75,831 million 2009: 80,085 million with a net fair value asset of 3,166 million 2009: asset of 3,004 million note 19.
The gains on the hedging instruments were 280 million 2009: losses of 995 million.
The losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were 452 million 2009: gains of 1,181 million.
In addition the Group has cash flow hedges which are primarily used to hedge the variability in the cost of funding within the wholesale business.
Note 19 shows when the hedged cash flows are expected to occur and when they will affect income for designated cash flow hedges.
The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2010 was 112,507 million 2009: 222,548 million with a net fair value liability of 843 million 2009: 2,536 million note 19.
In 2010, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a gain of 160 million 2009: nil.
There were no transactions for which cash flow hedge accounting had to be ceased in 2010 or 2009 as a result of the highly probable cash flows no longer being expected to occur.
2 CURRENCY RISK Foreign exchange exposures comprise those originating in treasury trading activities and structural foreign exchange exposures, which arise from investment in the Groups overseas operations.
The corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are transferred to the trading area where they are monitored and controlled.
These risks reside in the authorised trading centres who are allocated exposure limits.
The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London.
Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed on page 89.
252 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 56 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Risk arises from the Groups investments in its overseas operations.
The Groups structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches.
Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves.
The Group hedges part of the currency translation risk of the net investment in certain foreign operations using currency borrowings and cross currency derivatives.
At 31 December 2010 the aggregate notional principal of these currency borrowings was 5,135 million: the aggregate notional principal of the cross currency derivatives was 86 million 2009: cross currency swaps 2,507 million with a net fair value asset of 2 million 2009: asset of 25 million and they were designated on an after-tax basis as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
In 2010, an ineffectiveness loss of 28 million before tax and 20 million after tax 2009: ineffectiveness of nil before tax and nil after tax was recognised in the income statement arising from net investment hedges.
56 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups main overseas operations are in the Americas, Asia, Australasia and Europe.

The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below.
No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.

2 See note 54 Contingent liabilities and commitments for further information.
A general description of collateral held in respect of financial instruments is disclosed on page 77.
Loans and advances to banks the Group may require collateral before entering into a credit commitment with another bank, depending on the type of the financial product and the counterparty involved, and netting agreements are obtained whenever possible and to the extent that such agreements are legally enforceable.
Available-for-sale debt securities, treasury and other bills, held-to-maturity investments, and trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss the credit quality of the Groups available-for-sale debt securities, treasury and other bills, held-to-maturity investments, and the majority of the Groups trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held is set out below.
An analysis of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is included in note 18 and a similar analysis for available-for-sale financial assets is included in note 26.
The Groups held-to-maturity investments are all government debt securities.
The Groups non-participating investment contracts are all unit-linked.
Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which back those investment contracts were 129,702 million 2009: 118,573 million.
Movements in the fair value of such assets, including movements arising from credit risk, are borne by the contract holders.
Derivative assets the Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
An analysis of derivative assets is given in note 19.
Of the net derivative assets of 19,037 million 31 December 2009: 28,230 million, cash collateral of 1,429 million 31 December 2009: 6,645 million was held and a further 8,385 million was due from OECD banks 31 December 2009: 13,004 million.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held of the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held at 31 December 2010 of 2,146 million 31 December 2009: 1,875 million, 671 million 31 December 2009: 510 million were due from insurers with a credit rating of AA or above.
254 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 56 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Financial guarantees these represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customers obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do so.
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit.
The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less: most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.
Reverse repo and repo transactions for reverse repo transactions which are accounted for as collateralised loans, it is the Groups policy to seek collateral which is at least equal to the amount loaned.
At 31 December 2010, the fair value of collateral accepted under reverse repo transactions that the Group is permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge was 21,195 million 2009: 26,731 million.
Of this, 3,161 million 2009: 14,963 million was sold or repledged as at 31 December 2010.
The fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repo transactions, accounted for as secured borrowings, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was 53,781 million 31 December 2009: 96,409 million.
Stock lending in addition to financial assets on the balance sheet which are subject to repurchase agreements, there were financial assets on the balance sheet pledged as collateral as part of securities lending transactions which amounted to 124,139 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 92,449 million.
Stock borrowing Securities held as collateral as stock borrowed or under reverse repurchase agreements amounted to 93,419 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 95,881 million, of which 55,554 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 77,455 million had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Groups own transactions.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods immediately following a significant acquisition such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this combined businesses basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition date on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The remaining acquisition-related fair value adjustments in respect of this lending are therefore identified separately in this table.
The analysis of lending between retail and wholesale has been prepared based upon the type of exposure and not the business segment in which the exposure is recorded.
Included within retail are exposures to personal customers and small businesses, whilst included within wholesale are exposures to corporate customers and other large institutions.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss are disclosed in note 2 H. All impaired loans which exceed certain thresholds, principally within the Groups Wholesale division, are individually assessed for impairment by reviewing expected future cash flows including those that could arise from the realisation of security.
Included in loans and receivables are advances individually determined to be impaired with a gross amount before impairment allowances of 51,608 million 31 December 2009: 44,675 million which have associated collateral with a fair value of 14,869 million 31 December 2009: 10,217 million.

Wholesale lending has been classified using internal probability of default rating models mapped so that they are comparable to external credit ratings.
Good quality lending comprises the lower assessed default probabilities, with other classifications reflecting progressively higher default risk.
Classifications of retail lending incorporate expected recovery levels for mortgages, as well as probabilities of default assessed using internal rating models.

Collateral held against retail mortgage lending is principally comprised of residential properties: their fair value has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowance for indexation error and dilapidations.
The resulting valuation has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to provide a clearer representation of the Groups credit exposure.
Lending decisions are based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values for non-mortgage lending are assessed more rigorously at the time of loan origination or when taking enforcement action and may fluctuate, as in the case of floating charges, according to the level of assets held by the customer.
Whilst collateral is reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with business unit credit policy, this varies according to the type of lending and collateral involved.
It is therefore not practicable to estimate and aggregate current fair values of collateral for non-mortgage lending.
Renegotiated loans and advances Loans and advances that were renegotiated during the year and that would otherwise have been past due or impaired at 31 December 2010 totalled 5,475 million 31 December 2009: 3,919 million.

Further details of these schemes is set out in the risk report on pages 78 and 79.
The Group operates schemes that allow customers to repay a monthly amount which is lower than their contractual monthly payment for a short period.
These forbearance arrangements include short-term reduced or nil payment arrangements and transfers to interest only mortgages, as described on page 79.
During the period of forbearance, there is no clearing down of arrears such that, unless the customer is paying more than their contractual minimum payment, arrears balances will remain and the loan will continue to be reported as impaired.
When customers come to the end of their arrangement period they will continue to be managed as a mainstream collections case and if unable to recover then will move toward possession.
Under the Groups contractual repayment scheme, also described on page 79, customers can have their arrears balance capitalised once they have demonstrated they can pay the original contractual minimum payment, but are unable to clear their arrears.
This is usually demonstrated by the customer making six consecutive contractual monthly payments.
Customers are not, however, able to recapitalise more than twice in a five year period.
Such recapitalised loans are not considered to be impaired as the Group continues to expect to recover the original carrying amount of the loan.
Consequently, recapitalised mortgages will return to the non-impaired book and will be managed in accordance with the recapitalised terms of the mortgage.
In addition, the Group participates in a number of UK Government sponsored programmes designed to support households, which are described on page 78.
Where these schemes provide borrowers with a state benefit that is used to service the loan, there is no change in the reported status of the loan which is managed and reported in accordance with its original terms.

Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations.
In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against wholesale lending.
In such cases, the assets are carried on the Groups balance sheet and are classified according to the Groups accounting policies.
