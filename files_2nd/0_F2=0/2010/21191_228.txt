The review resulted in a reclassification of 1,890 million of insurance liabilities previously included as unit-linked non-participating liabilities as at 31 December 2009 to other non-participating liabilities.
As a result of this reclassification, assets held to cover linked liabilities have also decreased by 1,890 million see note 28. b Long-term business liabilities i Business description The Group underwrites long-term business in a number of countries as follows: In the UK mainly in: New With-Profits sub-fund NWPSF of Aviva Life & Pensions UK UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account RIEESA see below.
Old With-Profits sub-fund OWPSF, With-Profits sub-fund WPSF and Provident Mutual sub-fund PMSF of UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Non-profit funds of Aviva Annuity UK and UKLAP, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
The RIEESA of UKLAP, which is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the lock-in criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met.
RIEESA will be used to write non-profit business and also to provide capital support to NWPSF.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the Netherlands, the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders and after tax, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits that are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
Financial statements IFRS 249 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 39 Insurance liabilities continued In the United States, there are two main types of business protection products and accumulation products.
Protection products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies.
The accumulation product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business customers.
In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary companies.
All products are classified as insurance contracts except for the funding agreements and term certain immediate annuities, which are classified as non-participating investment contracts.
ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policyrelated liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
In the Provident Mutual and With-Profits sub-funds in UKLAP, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy-related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK government securities, plus a margin of 0.1% is used.
The rates vary, according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2010 being 3.78% 2009: 4.35% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
250 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 39 Insurance liabilities continued Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.
These are term-dependent, with specimen values for ten-year terms as follows: Volatility 2010 2009 Equity returns 26.1% 26.6% Property returns 15.0% 15.0% Fixed interest yields 13.2% 14.4% The table above shows the volatility of fixed interest yields, set with reference to 20 year at-the-money swaption volatilities.
Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2011 have been set consistently with the year-end 2010 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2010 2009 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or Axx00 adjusted Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement Non-profit business Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Valuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows: Valuation discount rates 2010 2009 Assurances Life conventional non-profit 2.8% to 3.5% 3.0% to 3.8% Pensions conventional non-profit 3.5% to 3.7% 3.8% to 4.0% Deferred annuities Non-profit in deferment 3.9% 4.2% Non-profit in payment 3.5% to 3.7% 3.8% to 4.0% Annuities in payment Conventional annuity 3.9% to 5.4% 4.2% to 5.7% Non-unit reserves Life 3.1% 3.3% Pensions 3.8% 4.1% Financial statements IFRS 251 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 39 Insurance liabilities continued Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality tables used 2010 2009 Assurances Non-profit AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 adjusted adjusted for smoker status and for smoker status and age sex age sex specific factors specific factors Pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting AM00 AF00 adjusted AM00 AF00 adjusted Pensions business after vesting PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement Annuities in payment General annuity business IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement b France The majority of reserves arise from a single premium savings product and is based on the accumulated fund value, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
Valuation discount rates Mortality tables used 2010 and 2009 2010 and 2009 Life assurances 0% to 4.5% TD73-77, TD88-90, TH00-02, TGF05 TGH05: H AVDBS, F AVDBS, H SSDBS and F SSDBS in 2010 Annuities 0% to 4.5% TPRV prospective table c Netherlands On transition to IFRS, the valuation of most long-term insurance and participating investment contracts was changed from existing methods that used historic assumptions to an active basis using current market interest rates.
A liability adequacy test is performed in line with IFRS requirements.
Where liabilities are based on current market interest rates and assets are valued at market value, the margin in the liability adequacy test is determined by comparison of the liabilities with the present value of best estimate cash flows.
The yield curve is constructed from yields on collateralised AAA bonds.
Annuitant mortality assumptions were revised in 2010.

The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values.
The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2010 was 4.50% 2009: 4.47%.
252 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 39 Insurance liabilities continued Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.
For the indexed products, the liability held is calculated based on the option budget method and is equal to the host contract and the calculated value of the derivative.
The value of the derivative is based on the present value of the difference between the projected fund value and the underlying fund guarantee.
The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, the largest component of the US business, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 1.00% to 5.20% in 2010 2009: 2.00% to 6.00%.
An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality.
The additional liability represents the present value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions.
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain indices.
A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum guaranteed value.
A further portion of the premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices.
Both the derivatives and the options embedded in the policy are valued at their fair value.
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years.
The excess charges are deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs.
Shadow adjustments may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities.
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income so that unrealised gains or losses on investments that are recognised directly in other comprehensive income affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same way as realised gains or losses.
e Other countries In all other countries, local generally accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the long-term business provisions during the year: 2010 2009 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 154,058 156,188 Provisions in respect of new business 12,502 11,105 Expected change in existing business provisions 9,259 7,625 Variance between actual and expected experience 1,858 2,154 Impact of other operating assumption changes 520 121 Impact of economic assumption changes 1,959 404 Exceptional strengthening of longevity assumptions see below 483 Other movements 197 1,112 Change in liability recognised as an expense 6,826 6,221 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 1,117 67 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,055 8,284 Carrying amount at 31 December 160,946 154,058 The variance between actual and expected experience of 1.9 billion in 2010 was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment markets, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values.
Equity markets increased, government bond yields fell in major markets and credit spreads on corporate bonds were broadly unchanged.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
A strengthening of longevity assumptions was made in the Netherlands, following the publication of new mortality tables, which is separately identified as an exceptional item.
The reduction in liabilities from other operating assumption changes mainly relates to assurance mortality assumptions in the UK and Ireland, with a corresponding reduction made to reassurance assets.
The 2.0 billion impact of economic assumption changes reflects reductions in valuation interest rates.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
