The address of the registered ofce is Debenhams plc, 1 Welbeck Street, London W1G 0AA.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or the Debenhams Group is the sale of fashion clothing and accessories, cosmetics and products for use in the home.
The Group trades from department stores and small store formats in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, on the internet and has international franchise stores.
The Group prepares its Financial Statements for the financial year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31 August of a given calendar year.
The principal companies within the Group during the financial year ended 28 August 2010 are disclosed in note 35.
Basis of Preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended 28 August 2010 and 29 August 2009 have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of the Financial Statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these results are based on managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates see note 5.
2 Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies are described below.
Consolidation The Financial Statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries include all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has the power to control.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
On consolidation, inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries have been changed where these have a significant impact on the Groups Income Statement or Balance Sheet to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
66 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 2 Accounting Policies continued Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, and is stated net of value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession and consignment sales are recognised when goods are sold to the customer.
Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit or debit card.
Internet sales are recognised when the goods are despatched to the customer.
Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group are recognised on the redemption of the gift card or gift voucher.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the end customer with a right of return.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
Segmental Reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segment information to be presented based on what is reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has identied the executive management board as its Chief Operating Decision Maker and has identied one operating segment, Retail.
Interest Recognition Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.
Dividend Distribution A final dividend distribution to the Company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company and Groups Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Retirement benefit Costs The liability or asset recognised in respect of dened benefit schemes is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the dened obligation at the balance sheet date.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling and that have terms to maturity which approximate to the terms of the related pension liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes in pension plans are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates a dened contribution scheme in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark and a stakeholder scheme in the UK.
Contributions to these pension schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
67 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the financial year ended 28 August 2010 2 Accounting Policies continued Share-Based Payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The Group measures the fair value using the valuation technique most appropriate to value each class of award, a Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or Binomial pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital at nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Exceptional Items Exceptional items are events or transactions which, by virtue of their size or nature, have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the Financial Statements.
Foreign Exchange a Functional and Presentational Currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
b Group Companies The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet: t income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the t cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transaction : and resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
t c Transactions and Balances Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on exchange are taken to the Income Statement.
68 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 2 Accounting Policies continued Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profits for the financial period using tax rates that are in force during the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
If deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeablefuture.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leased Assets a Finance Leases Leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classied as finance leases.
Finance leases are classied as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life or the period of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
b Operating Leases All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed xed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
69 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the financial year ended 28 August 2010 2 Accounting Policies continued Business Combinations The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
All costs directly attributable to an acquisition are expensed to the Income Statement.
Identiable assets and liabilities acquired in a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date: provided they meet the conditions set out in IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations.
The excess of cost over the Groups share of identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
If, after reassessment, the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of assets acquired, the excess is immediately recognised in the Income Statement.
Intangible Assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets of the acquired subsidiary.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which have been allocated to groups of cash-generating units on a regional basis for the purpose of impairment testing.
b Other Intangible Assets Acquired licences and trademarks are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, not to exceed ten years.
Internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and that the software generated will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
The software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, being three to eight years.
Property, Plant and Equipment It is the Groups policy to hold properties at cost less accumulated depreciation, subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 1 per cent Long leasehold land and buildings including landlords xtures and ttings 1 per cent or life of lease if shorter Short leasehold land and buildings including landlords xtures and ttings Life of lease Retail xtures and ttings 4 25 per cent Ofce equipment 10 12.5 per cent 1 Computer equipment 14 33 per cent 3 Vehicles 25 per cent or life of lease The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the Income Statement.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise stores, which are under construction, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use.
Transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment are made when the store opens.
No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction.
70 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 2 Accounting Policies continued Impairment Testing Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash generating units.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal of the impairment.
Available-for-Sale Investments The Group classies its investments as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Available-for-sale financial investments are non-derivative assets.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Investments are recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs.
The fair value of available-for-sale investments denominated in a foreign currency is calculated in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the reporting date.
An impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in equity.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method and represent goods for resale.
Concession inventories are not included within inventory held by the Group.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash ows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs that are facility costs are recognised initially at fair value, and are amortised over the term of the facilities using the effective interest rate on the committed amount of each facility.
Debt Repurchase The nominal value of debt repurchased has been accounted for as a loan redemption, reducing net borrowings at the balance sheet date.
71 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the financial year ended 28 August 2010 2 Accounting Policies continued Trade Payables Trade payables, dened as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely than not an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Promotional activities Provisions for promotional activities such as the cosmetics loyalty scheme are recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to provide a customer with goods or services.
Restructuring Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Derivatives Derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash ow hedges.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash ows of hedged items.
i Cash Flow Hedges The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the Income Statement which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
Forward exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges are fide-designated and subsequently classied as held for trading when the underlying forecast transaction is recognised in the Financial Statements.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassied and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the Balance Sheet or in the Income Statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is held in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately reclassied to the relevant line of the Income Statement, which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
ii Derivatives That Do Not Qualify For Hedge Accounting Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Income Statement within interest payable and other charges.
72 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 2 Accounting Policies continued New Standards and Interpretations During the year the Group adopted the following new standards, which have had an impact on the Group: IAS 1 revised Presentation of Financial Statements requires that the Group presents either one performance statement t Statement of Comprehensive Income: or two statements Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Group has elected to present two statements.
IAS 1 also requires the presentation of a Statement of Changes in Equity to be presented with the same prominence as all other statements.
The Financial Statements have been prepared using these reviseddisclosures.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires a management approach to the reporting of segmental information.
Further details regarding t the adoption of this standard and the new disclosures required are set out in note 3.
IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations requires some significant changes to the way business combinations are accounted for.
t All costs associated with business combinations are expensed directly to the Income Statement.
Additionally any changes to contingent consideration classied as debt must now be dealt with through the Income Statement subsequent to acquisition.
The amendment requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurement and t liquidity risk.
Full disclosures are set out in these Financial Statements.
Transitional provisions of the amendment to IFRS 7 have been applied, i. e. comparatives have not been disclosed for the fair value hierarchy.
The following new standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time this year: however these have no significant impact on the Group: IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements t IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction t IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate t IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation t IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners t IFRS 2 amendment Share-based Payments Amendment to Vesting Conditions and Cancellations.

These standards and interpretations are not effective for and have not been applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements: Effective date International Accounting Standards IFRS IFRS 2 amendment Share-based Payments Group settled share-based payment transactions 1 January 2010 IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2013 IAS 32 amendment Presentation on classication of rights issue 1 February 2010 IAS 24 amendment Related party disclosures 1 January 2011 Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009 IFRIC Interpretations IFRIC 14 amendment Prepayments on a minimum funding requirement 1 January 2011 IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers 31 October 2009 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments 1 July 2010 IFRS 9 has not yet been adopted by the European Union.
The Group is currently considering the implications of the adoption of these standards and interpretations.
They are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
3 Segmental Reporting The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 30 August 2009.
IFRS 8 requires disclosure of the operating segments which are reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identied as the executive management board, which includes the executive directors and other key management.
It is the executive management board that has responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group.
The Groups reportable segment has been identied as Retail.
The operating segment Magasin is not a reportable segment as it does not exceed 10 per cent of Group revenues, profits or gross assets: however, this information has been presented voluntarily within the segmental analysis below.
The segments are reported to the CODM to operating profit level, using the same accounting policies as applied to the Group accounts.
The Group has elected to adopt early the 2009 amendment to IFRS 8, which is effective for periods commencing on 1 January 2010.
This amendment states that an entity should only disclose a measure of segment assets when one is provided to the CODM.
No analysis is provided to the executive management board of the assets and liabilities of each operating segment within the monthly reporting pack.

Management believes that gross transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, consignments, staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, represents a good guide to the overall activity of the Group.
28 August 29 August 2010 2009 m m Gross transaction value 2,564.3 2,339.7 5 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Estimated Impairment of Goodwill The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The method requires an estimate of future cash ows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash ows.
Taxation and Deferred Taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.
At each financial period end, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
significant judgement is also required in determining the deferred tax on developers contributions, fair value losses and gains, retirement benefit assets and liabilities and other provisions.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the best estimate at the balance sheet date.
Where the final tax outcome of the above matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The final outcome of some of these tax items may give rise to material profit or loss and or cash ow movements.
Share-Based Payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated level of vesting being reviewed annually by management.
The key assumptions of this model are set out in note 30.
Pension Liability The Groups dened benefit schemes pension liability, which are assessed each period by actuaries, are based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, ination, future salary and pension costs.
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions: additional information relating to this is disclosed in note 24.
Estimated Useful Life of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group estimates the useful life of property, plant and equipment and reviews this estimate at each financial period end.
The Group also tests for impairment whenever a trigger event occurs.

The Finance No2 Act 2010, which was substantially enacted on 20 July 2010, included legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28 per cent to 27 per cent from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1 per cent per annum to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014.
These further changes had not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in these Financial Statements.
As at the balance sheet date, the effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate enacted in the Finance No 2 Act 2010 has been to reduce the net deferred tax asset recognised at 28 August 2010 by approximately 0.3 million.
This 0.3 million decrease has been recognised partly as an increase to profits in the Income Statement 0.1 million and partly as a loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income of 0.4 million in line with the treatment of the assets and liabilities giving rise to the net deferred tax asset.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1 per cent per year to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 27 per cent to 24 per cent, if applied to the deferred tax balances at 28 August, would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by approximately 0.8 million.

The final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 August 2008, which was paid in the year ended 29 August 2009, absorbed 4.3 million of shareholders funds.
13 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

Amortisation of Intangible Assets Amortisation on the Groups intangible assets has been charged to the Income Statement as follows for the financial years ended: 28 August 29 August 2010 2009 m m Included within: cost of sales 7.1 6.7 distribution costs 0.6 0.5 administrative expenses 1.6 0.9 9.3 8.1 Impairment Test for Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of Cash-Generating Units CGUs split on a regional basis according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
This allocation was primarily undertaken subsequent to the acquisition in December 2003 of the Debenhams stores by Debenhams plc.
The CGUs are set out below: North Midlands South-East South-West South Other Total m m m m m m m Goodwill 159.3 184.3 180.1 185.3 102.8 6.9 818.7 81 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the financial year ended 28 August 2010 14 Intangible Assets continued For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These cash ow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used in these projections are sales growth and discount rates.
The projections also assume that the change in sales mix from concessions to own bought stock will result in improved gross margins.
The five-year plan is built up using managements previous experience and incorporates managements view of current economic conditions and trading expectations.
Cash ows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of no growth after year five.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value-in-use was 8.0 per cent 2009: 8.0 per cent and reects the specic risks in the retail business.
Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance of individual stores and its expectations for the market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and risk-free rates.
Based on the value-in-use calculations, there is substantial headroom on a region by region basis, and a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would not cause an impairment write down to goodwill.
As a result of the impairment review, as at 28 August 2010, no impairment of goodwill has been required 2009: nil.

The Group has also taken advantage of current credit market conditions to buy back its debt in the market.
During the year the Group purchased debt with a par value of 30.2 million 2009: 61.4 million.
During the year the Group has complied with its covenants relating to its credit facilities.
Issue costs, which mainly relate to facility costs, are being amortised over the term of the facilities at the effective interest rate based on the committed amount of the term loan.
The amortisation charge relating to the issue costs of the credit facilities for the year ended 28 August 2010 was 5.7 million 2009: 4.4 million.

The Group subsequently entered into full tenant and landlord repairing sub-leases for 125 years.
At the year-end the following amounts remained outstanding under theleases: 28 August 29 August 2010 2009 m m Principal 37.7 37.7 Accrued interest 5.0 8.1 Outstanding liability 42.7 45.8 The rentals payable are structured so as to give the lessors a nancing return linked to LIBOR in the first 25 years and, in the following ten years, a LIBOR linked return together with the repayment of capital.
Thereafter, market rentals are payable subject to revision every five years.
In the early years, the amounts payable are below LIBOR and in the later years are in excess of LIBOR.
The nancing costs are, however, allocated over the 25-year period so as to achieve an annual funding cost which is consistent with LIBOR.
The Group has limited rights up to the 25th year of the leases to vary the terms of the leases to buy out the rental obligations based on the properties original sales proceeds.
The leases are reected in xed assets at their cost to the Group.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group disposed of six of the nine properties.
Further details of the disposal can be found in note 36 to the accounts.
ii Other Lease Obligations Other lease obligations relate mainly to security systems, print machinery and vehicles leased under hire purchase contracts.

The board delegates its responsibility for reviewing and approving Treasury Policy to the Audit Committee.
Reports are prepared monthly covering all areas of treasury activity and policy compliance and are reviewed by the Finance Director.
The board and Audit Committee receive regular reporting covering Treasury activities and policy compliance.
Group Treasury manages the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, available-for-sale assets, trade receivables and trade payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise finance for the Group.
Group Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Groups nancing and currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
The derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: funding and liquidity risk: t credit risk: t foreign exchange risk: and t interest rate risk.
t The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: i Funding and Liquidity Risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain exibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group nances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
The objective is to ensure that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash ow requirements of the Group for its current business plan.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the Groups net contractual undiscounted cash ows in respect of non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards, wholesale sales of products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with counterparties with a credit rating of Aor A3 or higher as assigned by Standard and Poors or Moodys respectively.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements net of any provision for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
iii Foreign Exchange Risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, the euro and to a lesser extent the Danish kroner.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with a settlement of up to two years.
Forecast cash ows are hedged to the extent that those cash ows are deemed highly probable.
The Group regularly reviews the need to hedge foreign exchange exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of its non-sterling businesses, hedging those exposures to the extent that they are considered appropriate for hedging.
A gain of 4.3 million 2009: 27.9 million was reclassied from equity to the Income Statement within cost of sales during the year in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges.
The notional value of open forward foreign exchange contracts at 28 August 2010 was 425.0 million 2009: 258.5 million.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts at 28 August 2010 are 6.4 million 2009: losses of 1.6 million.
This will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next two years.
During the year there were no contracts reclassied to held for trading due to cash ow hedges being ineffective.
iv Interest Rate Risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
The Groups current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The aim is to reduce exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the exibility to minimise early termination costs.
The Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target xed percentage of 75 per cent, with a 15 per cent tolerance 60-90 per cent.
88 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 22 Financial Risk Management continued a Financial Risks and Treasury Management continued iv Interest Rate Risk continued The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of oating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
These are usually matched with specic loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Groups main interest rate exposure is from the oating rate loans under the credit facilities.
At the year end the Groups hedged borrowings amounted to 302.5 million, being 51 per cent of the Groups total borrowings.
Following the renancing in July 2010, the Group is currently reviewing its longer term interest rate hedging arrangements and as part of this process, subsequent to 28 August 2010, additional hedging has been put in place such that the hedging level has increased to above the minimum 60 per cent required bypolicy.
Interest Rate Swaps The Groups interest rate swaps switch interest from oating rates to xed rates.
The Groups interest rate swap portfolio is summarised as follows: Notional Rate m % Maturity Interest rate swaps 302.5 1.6545.373 November 2011 to October 2013 The notional principal amount of interest rate swaps at 29 August 2009 was 727.5 million.
The net gains and losses on these swaps, which are deferred in equity, will reverse through interest in the Income Statement over the life of the swaps.
During the year a loss of 6.8 million was transferred from equity to the Income Statement within interest payable in respect of a portion of an interest rate swap that was closed during the year.
Financial Liabilities and Assets The interest rate proles of financial liabilities after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from oating to xed rates, used to manage interest were as follows: At 28 August 2010 At 29 August 2009 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m Financial liabilities 1 Sterling 306.5 290.6 597.1 730.2 56.9 787.1 1 Debt issue costs of 10.8 million 2009: 8.6 million are excluded from the financial liabilities above.
Fixed sterling financial liabilities comprise the hedged portion of the term loan of 302.5 million and 4.0 million of accrued interest at 28 August 2010.
The weighted average interest rate on the xed rate borrowings as at 28 August 2010 was 5.2 per cent 2009: 7.4 per cent, with the weighted average time for which rates are xed being 2.9 years 2009: 1.0 years.
Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR.
Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on LIBID or relevant base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.
Floating rate borrowings have been classied as xed if there were derivative financial instruments hedging the oating rate interest for more than one year.
The interest rate proles of financial assets were as follows: At 28 August 2010 At 29 August 2009 Non-interest Non-interest Fixed Floating bearing Total Fixed Floating bearing Total m m m m m m m m Financial assets Sterling 25.8 22.9 48.7 157.6 22.7 180.3 Euro 11.8 1.2 13.0 6.6 1.3 7.9 US dollars 3.3 3.3 Danish kroner 3.0 1.5 4.5 Total financial assets 43.9 25.6 69.5 157.6 6.6 24.0 188.2 89 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the financial year ended 28 August 2010 22 Financial Risk Management continued a Financial Risks and Treasury Management continued v Other Price Risk The Group is exposed to equity risk arising from equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
At the year end, if the valuations had been 10 per cent higher lower when all other variables were held constant: net profit would have been unaffected as the equity investments were classied as available-for-sale investments: and t other reserves would decrease increase by 0.3 million 2009: 0.4 million for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value t of available-for-sale investments.
b Capital Management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, provide returns for shareholders and benets to other stakeholders and to maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider: the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, the return of capital to shareholders, the issue or sale of shares: or the sale of assets to reduce debt.
The Group routinely monitors its capital and liquidity requirements through leverage ratios consistent with industry-wide borrowing standards, maintaining suitable headroom to bank facility covenants and credit market requirements to ensure nancing requirements continue to be serviceable.
c Fair Value Estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on discounted market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities to their fair values at the year end.
d Sensitivity Analysis The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on profit of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The range of sensitivities chosen, being 1 per cent movement in the interest rate or 5 per cent movement in sterling when compared to US dollar and euro, reects the Groups view of potential changes to these risk variables which existed at the year end.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments.
The analysis has been produced assuming no changes in the borrowings and existing interest rate swaps portfolio when considering the interest rate movement.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments that are expressed in currencies different to that of the functional currency.

An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment is required for the grant of an award.
An award under the PSP will comprise an option to receive free shares or nil cost options with performance conditions attached.
Awards under the scheme have been made since May 2006.
Options Granted on 7 May 2008 The vesting of half of the shares granted is dependent on Earnings Per Share EPS growth.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payments this is classied as a non-market condition and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value.
The vesting of the remaining half of the shares is dependent upon Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three-year period when compared to total shareholder return of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.
The fair value of the PSP options granted for this proportion of the award is calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation model assuming the inputs shown in the table below.
