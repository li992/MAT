Cynthia Carroll did not receive a BSP award in 2007 in respect of the 2006 financial year and consequently no shares vested in 2010.
Ren Mdori was awarded BSP shares in 2007 which vested in 2010.

44% of the Enhancement Shares would vest if EPS growth was RPI 9%, and 100% would vest if EPS growth was RPI 15%.
As the EPS growth was below the threshold target over the period, nil vesting of the Enhancement Shares occurred.
2 Where permitted by finance legislation, awards of Bonus Shares under the BSP are granted as forfeitable shares, which would be forfeited in the event that an executive director leaves service, other than as a good leaver, before the shares are released.
The number of Bonus Shares awarded in 2010 was reduced to meet income tax liabilities.
The reduction in respect of Cynthia Carroll was 19,231 shares and in respect of Ren Mdori was 12,088 shares at a value of 529,419 and 332,776 respectively.
3 In accordance with her terms upon joining, Cynthia Carroll was granted 132,718 forfeitable shares, in compensation for long-term incentives forgone at her previous employer.
The market price of the shares at the date of this award was 24.91.
These shares are forfeitable in the event that she leaves service before they are released to her.
As a result of the share consolidation following the demerger of Mondi, 11,945 shares lapsed and the resultant forfeitable award was 120,773 forfeitable shares, of which 72,464 were released to her in February 2008, 24,155 were released to her in February 2009 and 24,154 were released to her in February 2010, as follows: Beneficial interest in Number of forfeitable Number of forfeitable Beneficial interest in Latest forfeitable shares at shares vested during shares lapsed during forfeitable shares at performance Interests 31 December 2009 the year the year 31 December 2010 period end date Cynthia Carroll 24,154 24,154 n a Market price Market price Market value Shares vested Number of shares vested Date of conditional award at date of award at date of vesting at date of vesting Cynthia Carroll 24,154 21 02 2007 24.91 26.66 643,945 Figure 18: Long Term Incentive Plan Number of shares Number Number Total beneficial conditionally of shares of shares Total beneficial Latest interest in LTIP at awarded during vested lapsed interest in LTIP at performance 1 2 LTIP interests 1 January 2010 2010 during 2010 during 2010 31 December 2010 period end date Cynthia Carroll 262,295 87,582 44,858 28,680 276,969 31 12 2012 Ren Mdori 168,885 55,040 30,403 19,439 174,083 31 12 2012 1 The LTIP awards made in 2010 are conditional on two performance conditions as outlined on pages 101 to 103: the first is based on the Companys TSR relative to a weighted group of international mining companies and to the constituents of the FTSE 100: the second is based on the value delivered from AOSC initiatives during the medium term.
Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2010 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 101 to 103.
The market price of the shares at the date of award was 25.69.
2 The performance period applicable to each award is three years.
The performance period relating to the LTIP awards in 2007 which were granted on 23 March ended on 31 December 2009.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Companys TSR relative to a weighted group of international mining companies and the FTSE 100: the second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Companys ROCE in the medium term.
Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.
These awards are as follows: Number of shares Dates of conditional Market price at date Market price at date Money value at date Shares vested vested award of award of vesting of vesting Cynthia Carroll 44,858 23 03 2007 24.63 29.27 1,312,994 Ren Mdori 30,403 23 03 2007 24.63 29.27 889,896 In the case of the LTIP awards granted in 2007, the determinants for vesting were 50% on relative TSR and 50% on meeting specified Group ROCE targets.
The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period.
The entry-level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period.
In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long-term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects e. g. translation windfalls, capital in progress to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before producing a return, relevant changes in the composition of the Group e. g. significant acquisitions and disposals and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The threshold blended target i. e. the target on existing and new capital for the performance period for the 2006 LTIP was 37.46% and the upper blended target 39.46%.
The ROCE achieved was 43.20% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%.
On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three-year performance period of -25% which generated a nil% vesting in terms of the 2006 Sector Index Comparator Group against a median target of 23% and a 44% vesting against the FTSE 100 being between the 50th percentile and 90th percentile.
The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 25% Sectoral TSR and 25% FTSE 100 TSR split was therefore 61%.

2 Cynthia Carroll and Ren Mdori contractually agreed with AAS that supplementary pension contributions should be made into their respective defined-contribution pension arrangements in return for reductions in their future basic salaries and reductions in the cash elements payable under the BSP.
These supplementary contributions of 187,000 2009: nil and 450,000 2009: nil respectively, are included in Figure 15: Executive directors emoluments on page 105.
