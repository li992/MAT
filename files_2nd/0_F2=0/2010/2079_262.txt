These awards take the form of Performance Shares, Deferred Shares and or Options, and Restricted Shares in either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc.
Awards made are subject to performance hurdles LTIP and service conditions all plans.
Subject to the performance conditions and service conditions being met and the extent to which they are met, the awards will vest and the participant will become entitled to the appropriate number of ordinary shares or, if relevant, entitled to exercise options over the relevant number of ordinary shares.
A description of the plans follows: i GIS and GSTIP The GIS awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
The GSTIP is a replacement plan to the GIS for certain employees below the GMC and was first introduced during the year ended 30 June 2009.
Awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
Deferred Shares and or Options are subject to a two-year vesting period before they can be exercised.
If, during that period, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement is forfeited.
Deferred Shares and or Options in respect of the year ended 30 June 2010 will be awarded during the year ending 30 June 2011. ii LTIP and MAP The LTIP awards are in the form of Performance Shares, and are awarded annually.
The performance hurdle applicable to the awards granted requires the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR over a five-year performance period to be greater than the weighted average TSR of a peer group of companies.
To the extent that the performance hurdle is not achieved, awards are forfeited.
For all Performance Shares to vest, the Groups TSR must exceed the weighted average TSR of the Index by a specified percentage, determined each year by the Remuneration Committee.
Since the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this percentage has been set each year at 5.5 per cent.
For performance between the weighted average TSR of the Index and 5.5 per cent per annum above the Index, vesting occurs on a sliding scale.
The MAP is a replacement plan to the LTIP for employees below the GMC.
Under the MAP participants receive an Award of Restricted Shares, the number of which is determined by role, performance and organisational level.
There are no performance conditions attached to the Award and all the shares that have been granted will vest at the end of three years providing participants remain in employment over that time.
Participants in all award plans are eligible to receive a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the underlying shares represented by the Deferred Shares, Options, Restricted Shares and Performance Shares awarded to those participants the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
The Dividend Equivalent Payment is made to the participants once the underlying shares are issued or transferred to them.
No Dividend Equivalent Payment is made in respect of Deferred Shares, Options and Performance Shares that lapse.
b Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan, commenced in April 2007.
Employees may contribute up to US$5,000 to acquire shares Acquired Shares in any Plan year.
On the third anniversary of the start of a Plan year, the Company will match the number of Acquired Shares held by the employee at that time with Matched Shares.
The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the Matched Shares until they are awarded.
Acquired Shares are purchased on a quarterly basis.
Employees can sell their Acquired Shares at any time.
If, prior to the third anniversary, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement to Matched Shares is forfeited.
