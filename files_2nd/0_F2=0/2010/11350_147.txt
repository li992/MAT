Financial instruments a Group strategy The level of capital expenditure which the Group is obliged to incur is such that it cannot be wholly financed by internally generated sources.
As a result, the Group must rely upon raising additional finance on a regular basis, to be principally used to fund the long term assets required in its regulated business.
The Groups strategy is to finance such investment by raising medium to long term debt, to provide a balance sheet match with long term assets and to fix a major proportion of interest rates.

Financial instruments continued b Treasury operations The main purpose of the Groups treasury function is to assess the Groups ongoing capital requirement and to raise funding on a timely basis, taking advantage of any favourable market opportunities.
It also invests any surplus funds the Group may have, based upon its forecast requirements and in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
On occasions, derivatives are used as part of this process but the Groups policies prohibit their use for speculation.
c Risks arising from the Groups financial instruments The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
All treasury activities are conducted in accordance with these policies.
d Liquidity risk As regards day to day liquidity, the Groups policy is to have available standby committed bank borrowing facilities with a value of no less than 50.0 million and with a bank agreement availability period of no less than three months.
At 31 March 2010, the Group had 75.0 million of undrawn committed bank facilities 2009: 75.0 million.
These facilities matured in May 2010 and have not been renewed.
However, given the level of surplus cash available to fund the Groups operations, the Board have agreed to allow the current facilities to lapse, and to review the position in March 2011. e Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
It borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and, accordingly, uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups policy is to keep a minimum 60% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 31 March 2010, 75% 2009: 75% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates of interest.
Index linked borrowings are treated as variable rate debt.
f Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is that any foreign currency exposure in excess of 100,000 sterling equivalent of a transactional nature, or 3.0 million sterling equivalent of a translation nature, should be covered immediately on identification.
Any exposures are covered through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
g Market price risk The Groups exposure to market price risk principally comprises interest rate exposures.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk.
The following table shows the impact on profit and equity of an increase in the variable cost of borrowing.
The range is considered reasonable based on the forecast variable rates of borrowing and all other elements being consistent for the next 12 months and highlights this is not material to the Group: Effect on profit equity Increase in basis points m 2010 50 0.9 100 1.9 150 2.8 2009 50 0.8 100 1.5 150 2.3 113 Financial Auditors report Consolidated Consolidated Consolidated Consolidated Consolidated Notes to the Directors Auditors report Company balance Notes to the Shareholder Statements Group income statement statement of statement of balance sheet cash flow consolidated responsibilities Company sheet Company information comprehensive changes in equity statement financial Company financial income statements statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Financial instruments continued h Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Managements assessment of the maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date see o.
A significant proportion of the trade debtor balances are with domestic customers who are unlikely to have a published credit rating.
i Counterparty risk The treasury strategy, which is approved by the Board, requires that investments are limited to certain money market and treasury instruments, and that the Groups exposure to any single bank, building society or market is controlled, with maximum deposits allowed with any single counterparty.
The investment criteria cover credit rating and asset size, including sovereign and political risk.
Current market conditions have resulted in closer monitoring of counterparties and cancellation or suspension of deposits.
j Capital risk The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group monitors capital using gearing ratios for the Group and NWL.
For NWL, this is net debt divided by the RCV as determined and published by Ofwat, and for the Group, RCV plus a pro forma RCV for the Kielder securitisation and the PFI contracts at the level of associated debt included in the Groups net debt relating to those assets.
The Groups policy is to keep the gearing ratio less than 75% and 70% for the Group and NWL, respectively.
k Contractual maturity of financial liabilities principal and future interest payments The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March based on contractual undiscounted payments: Year ended 31 March 2010 Less than More than On demand 3 months 3-12 months 1-5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 1.5 40.3 118.0 824.4 4,381.8 5,366.0 Trade and other payables 0.1 10.8 0.1 11.0 1.6 51.1 118.1 824.4 4,381.8 5,377.0 Year ended 31 March 2009 Less than More than On demand 3 months 3-12 months 1-5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 16.5 40.7 113.9 671.6 4,632.9 5,475.6 Trade and other payables 63.0 27.6 0.2 90.8 16.5 103.7 141.5 671.8 4,632.9 5,566.4 114 Consolidated Notes to the Notes to the statement of Consolidated Consolidated consolidated Directors Company Financial Auditors report Consolidated comprehensive statement of Consolidated cash flow financial responsibilities Auditors report Company balance financial Shareholder Statements Group income statement income changes in equity balance sheet statement statements Company Company sheet statements information 20.

All the other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
In the absence of an openly traded market value for the index linked bonds with a book value of 455.4 million 2009: 462.0 million, the fair value at the balance sheet date has been calculated by considering the remaining debt maturity, the relevant UK index linked gilt rate and an appropriate credit spread by reference to market evidence for conventional bonds.
The difference between the principal value of 2,424.1 million 2009: 2,452.2 million and the carrying value of 2,458.7 million 2009: 2,491.4 million are unamortised issue costs of 14.7 million 2009: 15.4 million and a credit of 49.3 million 2009: 54.6 million in excess of the original loan proceeds to reflect the fair value of loans owed by subsidiaries acquired in 2003.

q Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
All other financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost.
Liabilities measured at fair value 31.3.
