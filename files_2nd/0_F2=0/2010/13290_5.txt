OPERATING RESULTS This year has seen the introduction of a number of new products Revenues continued to increase strongly during the second half including the QC20-W wireless Ballbar for checking the servoof the year and amounted to a 57% increase over the ing performance of three-axis machine tools: the RMP40, RLP40 comparable period in 2009 and 46% over revenues in the first and OLP40 compact probes with radio and optical signal half of the year.
This was supported by a superb performance by transmissions for multi-axis and mill-turn machine tools and our manufacturing teams.
Total revenues for the year were lathes: and the PH20 probe head for co-ordinate measuring 181.6m 2009 171.2m, which includes a currency benefit of machines was successfully launched at the Control Show in 8.1m when compared with the previous years exchange rates.
Geographically, there was a comparative reduction in turnover in continental Europe and the UK, but modest growth in the Americas and particularly strong growth in the Far East, largely China, and other territories, including India.
After reporting a first half year operating profit of 6.9m 2009 11.9m, Group operating profit for the year was 28.1m 2009 6.0m before an exceptional deduction of 1.7m for impairment costs of the investment in associates.
Profit before tax, including 6.8m currency benefit, amounted to 27.1m compared with 4.7m for the previous year and profit after tax was 21.3m 2009 3.6m resulting in earnings per share of 29.3p 2009 4.9p.
Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the exceptional impairment write-down this year and redundancy costs last year, were 31.6p, compared with 9.3p last year.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS As reported at the half year, the Group has divided its operating, research and development and reporting activities into two main GREEN ENERGY GIANT GRINDS WITH segments: the traditional Metrology business, the cornerstone of Renishaw, and, more recently, the as yet smaller Healthcare MICRON PRECISION activities into which parts of Renishaw have migrated or which Wind turbines are a striking sight, some might say beautiful, some an have been established or acquired.
eye-sore, but there is no escaping the fact that they are increasingly in demand to generate renewable power.
Producing enormous Metrology components such as the bearings presents new engineering Metrology revenue grew to 162.1m from 152.9m in 2009, with challenges, which KMT Lidkping have solved very successfully.
operating profits, prior to exceptional items, of 31.5m Based in the town of Lidkping in the centre of Sweden, its new hard-turning VTG4000 Vertical Turning Grinding machine uses a compared with 10.3m in 2009.
Particular growth was TM combination of Renishaw SiGNUM optical linear and angle encoders experienced in the Far East and, in terms of products, there was to achieve the accuracy required, and robust Renishaw magnetic strong demand for our encoder and laser scale products.
encoders on the exposed axes of the cutting heads.
This sector continues to invest heavily in development of new Eive Johansson is Lidkpings VTG Chief Designer, Our largest machine products.
Research and Development, including associated used to accommodate parts up to 600 mm diameter, but the VTG4000 can handle diameters in excess of 4000 mm, the size of the largest wind turbine engineering costs, was 22.0m 2009 26.2m.
This is hard turning and grinding which can be very demanding, and the positioning accuracy is very important, with a direct effect on the quality of the finished bearings.
A standard size machine, using ballscrews on the axes, will manage to maintain a 3 !m form deviation, yet despite the considerable difference in relative size, the VTG4000 has been proven to achieve an exceptional form deviation of less than 1 !m, with feed resolution in 0.1 !m steps.
