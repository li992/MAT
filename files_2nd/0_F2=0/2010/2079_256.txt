While the annual financial reporting date may be different to the Groups, financial information is obtained as at 30 June in order to report on a consistent annual basis with the Groups reporting date.
b While the Group holds a 57.5 per cent interest in Minera Escondida Limitada, the entity is subject to effective joint control due to participant and management agreements which results in the operation of an Owners Council, whereby significant commercial and operational decisions are determined on aggregate voting interests of at least 75 per cent of the total ownership interest.
Accordingly the Group does not have the ability to unilaterally control, and therefore consolidate, the investment in accordance with IAS 27 AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
c Richards Bay Minerals comprises two legal entities, Richards Bay Mining Proprietary Limited and Richards Bay Titanium Proprietary Limited, in each of which the Group has a 50 per cent interest and which function as a single economic entity.
After deducting non-controlling interests in subsidiaries of Richards Bay Minerals, the Groups economic interest in the operations of Richards Bay Minerals is 37.76 per cent.
