Explanatory Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting The notes on the following pages give an explanation of the Resolutions.
Resolutions 1 to 9 are proposed as ordinary resolutions.
This means that for each of those Resolutions to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the Resolution.
Resolutions 10 to 12 are proposed as special resolutions.
This means that for each of those Resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the Resolution.
Resolution 1: Annual Report and Accounts 2010 The purpose of this Resolution is to receive the Companys Accounts and the Reports of the Directors and Auditors for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Resolution 2: Remuneration Report The purpose of this Resolution is to approve the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2010.
This can be found on pages 33 to 37 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 3 to 6: Directors Biographical details of the Directors presenting themselves for election or re-election can be found on pages 28 and 29 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 7 and 8: Auditors The purpose of these Resolutions is to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as Auditors of the Company and to authorise the Directors to agree the remuneration of the Auditors.
Resolution 9: General power to allot The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph A of Resolution 9 to grant options under the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and the SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan.
Options granted pursuant to this authority will nevertheless count towards limits on the number of new Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options.
Paragraph B of this resolution would give the Directors the authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities into shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to 103,469,307 representing 103,469,307 ordinary shares.
This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company as at 18 February 2011, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice.
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, paragraph C of this resolution would give the Directors authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities into shares in connection with a rights issue in favour of Shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to 206,938,615 representing 206,938,615 ordinary shares, as reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued under paragraph B of this resolution.
This amount before any reduction represents approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 18 February 2011, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise any of the authorities sought under paragraphs B and C of this Resolution.
However, if they do exercise the authorities, the Directors intend to follow recommendations from the Association of British Insurers concerning their use including as regards the Directors standing for re-election in certain cases.
The authorities sought under paragraphs A, B and C of this Resolution will expire at the earlier of 30 June 2012 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2012.
As at the date of this notice, no Shares are held by the Company in treasury.
Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2010 94 Notice of Annual General Meeting Resolution 10: Notice of general meetings Changes made to the Companies Act 2006 by the Shareholders Rights Regulations increase the notice period required for general meetings of the Company to 21 days unless Shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days.
Annual general meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days notice.
Before the coming into force of the Shareholders Rights Regulations on 3 August 2009, the Company was able to call general meetings other than an annual general meeting on 14 clear days notice without obtaining such Shareholder approval.
In order to preserve this ability, Resolution 10 seeks such approval.
The approval will be effective until the Companys next annual general meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of Shareholders as a whole.
Note that the changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days notice, the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all Shareholders for that meeting.
Resolution 11: General power to disapply pre-emption rights This Resolution will be proposed as a special resolution, which requires a 75% majority of the votes to be cast in favour.
It would give the Directors the authority to allot shares or sell any shares which the Company may elect to hold in treasury for cash without first offering them to existing Shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph A of Resolution 11 to grant options under the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and the SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph B of Resolution 11 whenever they believe it is advantageous to Shareholders to do so.
The Directors are seeking the authority referred to in paragraph C of Resolution 11 in order to provide flexibility in raising monies to take advantage of opportunities arising through the launch of new funds and for general corporate purposes.
It is the intention of the Board that any equity securities allotted under this authority will be allotted at an effective premium to the estimated net asset value per Share at the date of pricing of the issue of the relevant equity securities.
The authority in paragraphs B and C would be limited to allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those securities or as the Board otherwise considers necessary, or otherwise up to a nominal amount of 15,520,396 representing 15,520,396 shares.
This nominal amount represents approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 18 February 2011, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice.
The authority will expire at the earlier of 30 June 2012 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2012.
Resolution 12: Authority to undertake market purchase of own Shares Authority is sought for the Company to purchase up to 14.99% of its issued Shares, renewing the authority granted at previous annual general meetings.
The Company did not purchase any Shares in the period from the last annual general meeting to the date of this notice under the existing authority.
The Directors would consider exercising the authority provided by this resolution to acquire shares to hold in treasury to satisfy share options.
The Directors believe holding such shares as treasury shares will provide the Company with increased flexibility in managing its share capital.
Otherwise the Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to make market purchases, however the authority provides the flexibility to allow them to do so in the future as they keep under review the share price discount to net asset value.
The Directors will exercise this authority only when to do so would be in the best interests of the Company, and of its Shareholders generally, and could be expected to result in an increase in the net asset value per Share taking into account relevant factors and circumstances at the time.
The minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for a Share is 1.00.
The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for a Share is the highest of i an amount equal to 5% above the average market value for a Share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase and ii the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out.
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding at 18 February 2011 was 11,998,960, which represented approximately 3.9% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date.
If the Company were to purchase the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted by this resolution then the options outstanding at 18 February 2011 would represent approximately 4.5% of the issued ordinary share capital.
However, the Directors do not presently intend to exercise the existing authority prior to its expiry on 31 March 2011.
