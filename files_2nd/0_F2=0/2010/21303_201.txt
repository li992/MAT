SVP awards are granted to participants in the form of a provisional allocation of Barclays shares which vest over a period of three years in equal annual tranches.
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares.
Awards under the SVP qualify for dividends.
Performance Share Plan PSP The Performance Share Plan PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM to replace the ISOP scheme.
Performance shares are free Barclays shares for which no exercise price is payable and which qualify for dividends.
Performance share awards are communicated to participants as an initial allocation.
Barclays performance over a three-year period determines the final number of shares that may be released to participants.
Incentive Share Plan ISP The Incentive Share Plan Incentive Shares was introduced in March 2008.
Incentive Shares are granted to participants in the form of a provisional allocation of Barclays shares which vest upon achieving continued service after three years.
Incentive Shares qualify for dividends.
Executive Share Award Scheme ESAS For certain employees of the Group an element of their annual bonus is in the form of a deferred award of a provisional allocation of Barclays PLC shares under ESAS.
The total value of the bonus made to the employee, of which ESAS is an element, is dependent upon the business unit, Group and individual employee performance.
The ESAS element of the annual bonus must normally be held for at least three years.
Additional bonus shares are subsequently awarded to recipients of the provisional allocation and vest upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date of award.
ESAS awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes under JSAP Joiners Share Award Plan.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the individual resigns and commences work with a competitor business.
LTIP plans are cash and equity performance plans which after 3 years dependant on performance pay half in cash and the remaining half in shares which are placed into ESAS for a further 1 or 2 years.
Sharesave Eligible employees in the UK, Spain and Ireland may participate in the Barclays Sharesave scheme.
Under this scheme, employees may enter into contracts to save up to 250 per month Ireland: 300, Spain: 225 and at the expiry of a xed term of three, five or seven years Spain: three years have the option to use these savings to acquire shares in the Company at a discount, calculated in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
The discount is currently 20% of the market price at the date the options are granted.
Participants in the scheme have six months from the date of vest in which the option can be exercised.
UK Sharepurchase Sharepurchase was introduced in January 2002.
It is an HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee share plan.
The plan is open to all eligible UK employees, including executive Directors.
Under the plan, participants are able to purchase up to 1,500 worth of Barclays PLC ordinary shares per tax year, which if kept in trust for five years can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free.
Matching shares were introduced to the scheme during 2005 where the purchase of Barclays shares by the participant are matched equally by the Company up to a maximum value of 600 per tax year.
Shares in the plan will earn dividends in the form of additional shares, which must normally be held by the trustee for three years before being eligible for release.

com annualreport10 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31st December 2010 continued 39 Share-based payments continued Other schemes In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a number of other schemes including schemes operated by and settled in the shares of subsidiary undertakings, none of which are individually or in aggregate material in relation to the charge for the year or the numbers of issued shares.
Share option plans As noted above, the Groups schemes include a number of share option schemes including grants of nil cost options.
The weighted average fair value per option granted during the year is as follows: 2010 2009 m m SVP 3.54 ESAS 2.88 1.08 PSP 3.55 2.81 ISP 3.55 2.58 Sharepurchase 3.07 1.82 Sharesave 1.29 1.43 Sharepurchase, ISP, SVP and ESAS are nil cost awards on which the performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value at that date.
As described above, the terms of the ESAS scheme require shares to be held for a set number of years from the date of vest.
The calculation of the vest date fair value of such awards includes a reduction for this post-vesting restriction.
This discount is determined by calculating how much a willing market participant would rationally pay to remove the restriction using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Fair values for Sharesave and PSP are calculated at the date of grant using either a Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulation.
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted from 2007 to 2010 under the Groups major share schemes are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average Expected Expected share price exercise price volatility option life 2010 PSP 3.55 3.46 45% 2 years Sharesave 3.21 2.67 45% 4 years 2009 PSP 2.34 1.77 45% 2 years Sharesave 3.51 2.70 45% 4 years 2008 PSP 5.45 2.07 37% 3 years Sharesave 3.11 2.51 37% 4 years 2007 PSP 7.07 25% 3 years Sharesave 5.82 4.81 25% 4 years Expected Volatility Expected volatility and dividend yield on the date of grant have been used as inputs into the respective valuation models for Sharesave and PSP.
The assumed dividend yield for Barclays PLC is the average annual dividend yield on the date of grant of 2% 2009: 2%.
Discount Rate The yield on UK government bonds with a commensurate life has been used to determine the risk-free discount rate of 2% 2009: 3% for Sharesave and PSP.
Option life is estimated based upon historical data for the holding period of options between grant and exercise dates.
Expected option life and number expected to vest For the purposes of determining the expected life and number of options to vest, historical exercise patterns have been used, together with an assumption that a certain percentage of options will lapse due to leavers.
