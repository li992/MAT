The summary is quali ed in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act 2006 of Great Britain the Act, as amended, and the Companys Articles of Association.

INCORPORATION The Company is incorporated under the name Michael Page International plc and is registered in England and Wales with registered number 3310225.
SHARE CAPITAL The Act abolished the concept of, and requirement for a company to have, an authorised share capital.
As such, the Company no longer has an authorised share capital.
ALTERATION OF CAPITAL The Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution: a consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares: b sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of a smaller amount than its existing shares: and c determine that, as between the shares resulting from such a sub-division, any of them may have any preference or advantage as compared with the others.
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account, in any way.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may purchase its own shares, including redeemable shares.
The Company proposes to renew its authority to purchase its own shares for another year in item 17 of the Annual General Meeting notice.
GENERAL MEETINGS AND VOTING RIGHTS The Directors may call general meetings whenever and at whatever time and location they so determine.
Subject to the provisions of the Act, an annual general meeting and all general meetings which shall be called extraordinary general meetings shall be called by at least 21 clear days notice.
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may resolve to reduce the notice period for general meetings other than annual general meetings to 14 days on an annual basis.
The Company proposes to renew its authority to hold general meetings on 14 days notice for another year in item 18 of the Annual General Meeting notice.
Two persons entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted shall be a quorum.
The Articles of Association provide that subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands every member and every duly appointed proxy present shall have one vote.
Every corporate representative present who has been duly authorised by a corporation has the same voting rights as the corporation would be entitled to.
On a poll every member present in person or by a duly appointed proxy or corporate representative shall have one vote for every share of which he is a holder or in respect of which his appointment as proxy or corporate representative has been made.
No member shall be entitled to vote in respect of any share held by him if any call or other sum payable by him to the Company remains unpaid.
If a member or any person appearing to be interested in shares held by a member has been duly served with a notice under the Act and is in default for the prescribed period in supplying to the Company information thereby required, unless the Directors otherwise determine, the member shall not be entitled in respect of the default shares to be present or to vote either in person or by representative or proxy at any general or class meeting of the Company or on any poll or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to such meeting or poll.
In certain circumstances, any dividend due in respect of the default shares shall be withheld and certain certi cated transfers may be refused.
A member entitled to more than one vote need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.
A member is entitled to appoint another person as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend and speak and vote at a meeting of the Company.
A proxy need not be a member.
A member may appoint more than one proxy to attend on the same occasion.
This does not preclude the member from attending and voting at the meeting or at any adjournment of it.
Michael Page International 93 LIMITATIONS AND NON-RESIDENT OR FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS English law treats those persons who hold the shares and are neither UK residents nor nationals in the same way as UK residents or nationals.
They are free to own, vote on and transfer any shares they hold.
VARIATION OF RIGHTS If at any time the capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class of may be varied either: a in such manner if any as may be provided by those rights: or b in the absence of any such provision, with the consent in writing of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class, but not otherwise, and may be so varied either whilst the Company is a going concern or during, or in contemplation of, a winding-up.
At every such separate general meeting the necessary quorum shall be at least two persons together holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares, save that at any adjourned meeting any holder of shares of the class other than treasury shares present or by proxy shall be a quorum.
Unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights attached to any class of shares, those rights shall be deemed not to be varied by the purchase by the Company of any of its own shares or the holding of such shares as treasury shares.
DIVIDEND RIGHTS Holders of the Companys ordinary shares may by ordinary resolution declare dividends but no such dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the Directors.
If, in the opinion of the Directors, the pro ts of the Company available for distribution justify such payments, the Directors may, from time to time, pay interim dividends on the shares of such amounts and on such dates and in respect of such periods as they think t. The pro ts of the Company available for distribution and resolved to be distributed shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid.
The members may, at a general meeting declaring a dividend upon the recommendation of the Directors, direct that it shall be satis ed wholly or partly by the distribution of speci c assets.
No dividend shall be paid otherwise than out of pro ts available for distribution as speci ed under the provisions of the Act.
Any dividend unclaimed after a period of twelve years from the date of declaration of such dividend shall, if the Directors so resolve, be forfeited and shall revert to the Company.
CALLS ON SHARES Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may make calls upon members in respect of any amounts unpaid on their shares whether in respect of nominal value or premium and each member shall pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on his shares.
TRANSFER OF SHARES Any member may transfer all or any of his shares in certi cated form by instrument of transfer in the usual common form or in any other form which the Directors may approve.
The transfer instrument shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and, except in the case of fully-paid shares, by or on behalf of the transferee.
Where any class of shares is for the time being a participating security, title to shares of that class which are recorded as being held in uncerti cated form, may be transferred to not more than four transferees by the relevant system concerned.
The Directors may in their absolute discretion refuse to register any transfer of shares being shares which are not fully paid or on which the Company has a lien, provided that if the share is listed on the Of cial List of the UK Listing Authority such refusal does not prevent dealings in the shares from taking place on an open and proper basis.
The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer of shares whether fully paid or not unless the transfer instrument: a is lodged at the registered of ce, or such other place as the Directors may appoint, accompanied by the relevant share certi cate s : b is in respect of only one class of share: and c is in favour of not more than four transferees.
The Directors of the Company may refuse to register the transfer of a share in uncerti cated form to a person who is to hold it thereafter in certi cated form in any case where the Company is entitled to refuse or is excepted from the requirements under the Uncerti cated Securities Regulations 2001 to register the transfer.
