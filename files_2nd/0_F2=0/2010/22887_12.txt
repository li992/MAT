DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2010 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information Dexion Absolute Limited the Company was incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey, Channel Islands as a closed-ended investment company on 26 November 2002.
The Companys ordinary shares were initially listed on the London Stock Exchange on 19 December 2002.
The Company is authorised in Guernsey, Channel Islands under The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Significant accounting policies a Statement of Compliance The financial statements which give a true and fair view are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and are in compliance with The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Determination and presentation of operating segments IFRS 8 Operating segments requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The Board has considered the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, and is of the view that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in hedge funds.
The Board, as a whole, has been determined as constituting the chief operating decision maker of the Company.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Companys performance and to allocate resources is the total return on the Companys net asset value, as calculated under IFRS, and therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in these financial statements.
The Board of Directors have overall management and control of the Company.
Material changes to the investment objective or investment policy can only be made by Shareholders.
The Board of Directors have delegated the day to day implementation of this strategy to its Investment Adviser but retain responsibility to ensure that adequate resources of the Company are directed in accordance with their decisions.
The investment decisions of the Investment Adviser are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the policies and legal responsibilities of the Board.
The Investment Adviser has been given full authority to act on behalf of the Company, including the authority to purchase and sell securities and other investments on behalf of the Company and to carry out other actions as appropriate to give effect thereto.
Whilst the Investment Adviser may make the investment decisions on a day to day basis re the allocation of funds to different investments, any changes to the investment strategy or major allocation decisions have to be approved by the Board, and any material changes to the investment strategy have to be approved by Shareholders, even though they may be proposed by the Investment Adviser and Manager.
The Board therefore retains full responsibility as to the major allocations decisions made on an ongoing basis.
The Investment Adviser will always act in accordance with the investment policy and investment restrictions set out in the Company's latest Prospectus which cannot be radically changed without the approval of the Shareholders.
Applicable new standards and interpretations not yet effective In November 2009, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
This represents the first of a three part project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
The objective of the standard is to enhance the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the accounting of financial assets and to reduce complexity.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential effect of this standard.
The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements since the majority of the Companys financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
b Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency, rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.
They are prepared on a fair value basis for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and derivative financial instruments.
Other financial assets and financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost.

Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of preparation continued The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements: c Revenue recognition Interest income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Income distributions from investment funds are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as dividend income when declared.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss i Classification The Company designates all of its investments upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.
These include financial assets that are not held for trading purposes and which may be sold and represent a group of financial assets which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the entitys key management personnel.
These are principally investments in unlisted open-ended hedge funds.
Financial instruments held for trading include forward foreign currency deals awaiting settlement.
Financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables include sales awaiting settlement and other receivables.
Financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss include purchases awaiting settlement, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The table in Note 3 details the categories of financial assets and liabilities held by the Company at the reporting date.
ii Recognition The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities on the date it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A regular way purchase and sale of financial instruments is recognised using trade date accounting.
From this date any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities are recorded.
iii Measurement Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value transaction price.
Transaction costs on financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are expensed immediately.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes in their fair value recognised in the statement in of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less impairment losses, if any.
Financial liabilities, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Significant accounting policies continued e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss continued iv Fair value measurement principles Investments in underlying funds which are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange or other trading facility are valued at the NAVs provided by such entities or their administrators.
These values may be unaudited or may themselves be estimates.
In addition, these entities or their administrators may not provide values at all or in a timely manner and, to the extent that values are not available, those investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser using valuation techniques appropriate to those investments.
In determining fair value, the Investment Adviser takes into consideration, where applicable, the impact of suspensions, of redemptions, liquidation proceedings, investments in side pockets and other significant factors.
Actual values may differ from these estimates.
Open forward foreign currency contracts at the reporting date are valued at forward currency rates at that point.
The unrealised appreciation or depreciation on open forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to the difference between the contracted rate and the rate to close out the contract.
Options are fair valued at last traded market prices.
For open option contracts, changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognised as unrealised gains or losses by fair valuing the contract at the reporting date and are included in the movement in unrealised gain or loss on securities in the statement of comprehensive income.
When the contract is closed, the difference between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transaction is recorded as a realised gain or loss.
For open futures contracts, changes in fair value of the contracts are recognised as unrealised gains or losses by marking to market the value of the contract at the reporting date.
When the contract is closed, the difference between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transactions and the original transaction is amended as a realised gain or loss.
v Realised and unrealised gains and losses Realised gains and losses arising on disposal of investments are calculated by reference to the proceeds received on disposal and the average cost attributable to those investments, and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Unrealised gains on investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
vi Impairment Financial assets that are stated at cost or amortised cost are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
If any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets effective interest rate.
If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the write-down, the write-down is reversed through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
vii Derecognition The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
The Company uses average cost method to determine the gain or loss on derecognition.

Significant accounting policies continued f Foreign currency transactions The financial statements of the Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates its functional currency.
The Directors have considered the primary economic currency of the Company and considered the currency in which the original capital was raised, distributions are to be made and ultimately the currency capital would be returned on a break up basis.
The Directors have also considered the currency to which the underlying investments are exposed.
On balance, the Directors believe that pounds sterling best represents the functional currency.
For the purpose of the financial statements the results and financial position of the Company are expressed in sterling which is the presentation currency of the Company.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
Realised and unrealised gains or losses on currency translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Foreign currency differences relating to investments at fair value through profit or loss are included in gains and losses on investments note 3. g Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents, which include bank overdrafts, are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
Cash, deposits with banks and bank overdrafts are stated at their principal amount.
h Issue costs Expenses associated with the issue of ordinary shares other than those arising on the issue or conversion of C shares are borne exclusively by the holders of ordinary shares.
These expenses, when incurred, are written off against share capital.
During the year, there were no ordinary shares issued.
i Treasury Shares Where the Company purchases its own share capital whether into treasury or for cancellation, the consideration paid, which includes any directly attributable costs net of income taxes is recognised as a deduction from equity shareholders funds through the special reserve, which is a distributable reserve.
When such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to from the special reserve.
Shares held in treasury are not taken into account in determining NAV per share detailed in Note 9 and earnings per share detailed in Note 12.

Financial Risk Management The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in an actively managed portfolio of hedge funds, diversified by investment strategy, style and manager, in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, with little correlation to equity and fixed interest benchmarks.
a Capital risk management The company manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to equity holders through the optimisation of equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of shareholders equity which comprises issued share capital, and other reserves.
The Company adheres to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The techniques and instruments utilised for the purposes of efficient portfolio management are those which are reasonably believed by the Investment Adviser to be economically appropriate to the efficient management of the Company.
The Companys financial instruments include cash and currency hedging.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to moderate certain risk exposures.
b Market price risk management Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents both gains and losses suffered through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Investment Adviser in pursuance of its investment objective and policy.
Adherence to the Companys investment restrictions set out on pages 14 and 15 in the Directors Report mitigates the risk of excessive exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio at the reporting date are disclosed in summary form in the Managers Report.
Details of the nature and terms of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the statement of financial position date are set out in note 13.
Price Sensitivity Analysis If the price of the underlying hedge funds increased decreased by 10% the NAV of the Company would increase decrease by 85,767,449 2009: 79,047,419.
Actual trading results may differ from the above sensitivity analysis and these differences may be material.
c Interest rate risk management Substantially all of the Companys assets are non-interest bearing investments and its exposure to interest rate changes is limited.
The Company has cash and cash equivalents of 36,112,343 2009: 64,885,640, and has a bank overdraft of 64,176,666 2009: 10,326,047 at the year end and is therefore subject to cashflow interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The short term investments included within cash equivalents and bank overdraft have an overnight maturity, and as a result they have a limited exposure to fair value interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

The Company has a secured variable funding note agreement with Credit Suisse International of up to a maximum of 200 million or 25% of Net Assets whichever is the lower.
This secured variable funding note matured on 30 August 2010 and the Company delivered an extension request to roll the secured variable funding note for a further 12 months with effect from 30 August 2010.
In March 2011 the Board performed a review of potential credit providers that resulted in a further request to Credit Suisse to roll the facility for another 12 months with effect from 30 August 2011.
The Board expects the facility will have been rolled over by this date.
Secured variable funding note fees incurred amounted to 1,718,457 2009: 968,582.
The secured variable funding note is secured against the Companys cash accounts, cash balances, custody accounts, the custodial agreement and any derivative asset.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal and opposite effect.
d Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
Credit risk is generally higher when a non-exchange traded financial instrument is involved because the counterparty for non-exchange traded financial instruments is not backed by an exchange clearing house.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk on the financial assets with its brokers.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the statement of financial position date.
This relates also to financial assets carried at amortised cost, as they have a short-term to maturity.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2010 2009 000 000 Financial assets at fair value 857,674 790,474 Cash and cash equivalents 36,112 64,886 Forward currency contracts 927,858 899,017 Options 1,386 276 Sales awaiting settlement 62,956 118,561 Other receivables 4 68 Total 1,885,990 1,873,282 36 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2010 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 4.
Financial Risk Management continued d Credit risk management continued Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are usually with counterparties with whom the Company has signed master netting agreements.
Master netting agreements provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default.
Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved and the credit quality of the brokers used.
Investments made by the Company and the funds in which it invests may not be regulated by the rules of any stock exchange or investment exchange or other regulatory body or authority.
The counterparties to such investments have no obligation to make markets in such investments.
Furthermore, the Company will be subject to the risk of bankruptcy of, or the inability or refusal to perform with respect to such investments by, the counterparties with which the Company deals.
The Investment Adviser carries out due diligence procedures before investing in an underlying managers fund.
Procedures are also in place to monitor the managers on a regular basis, thereby ensuring that the Company limits its exposure to credit risk on its underlying funds.
The Company monitors the credit rating and financial positions of the brokers used to further mitigate this risk.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by Northern Trust Guernsey Limited.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the Custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit quality and financial position of the Custodian.
Depending on the requirements of the jurisdictions in which the investments of the fund are issued, the custodian may use the services of one or more sub-custodians.
All of the cash held by the Company is held by the Custodian and certain other financial institutions.
Bankruptcy or insolvency by the Custodian and financial institutions may cause the Companys rights with respect to the cash held by the Custodian and financial institutions to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit rating of the Custodian and other financial institutions.
If the credit quality or the financial position of the Custodian deteriorates significantly the Investment Adviser may move the cash holdings to another bank.
The credit rating of the Northern Trust Company at the year end was AA 2009: AA per Standard and Poors.
Credit Suisse have a charge over assets of the Company in the event of default of payment.
The Investment Adviser analyses credit concentration based on the counterparty of the financial assets that the Company holds.
Details of the Companys ten largest holdings at 31 December 2010 are detailed in the Managers Report on page 11.
The Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk were concentrated in the following industries: 2010 2009 %% Banks 4.96 7.31 Hedge Funds 95.04 92.68 Other 0.01 Total 100.00 100.00 e Currency risk The Company may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.
Consequently the Company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The Companys operating activities include investing in derivative financial instruments that involve varying degrees of currency risk.
The derivative contracts that the Company holds from time to time are forward contracts on foreign currencies for hedging non-sterling share classes, an index option and futures contracts.
Details of forward contracts on foreign currencies, the index options and futures contracts held at 31 December 2010 are set out in note 13.
The Companys currency risk is managed on a daily basis by the Investment Adviser in accordance with policies and procedures in place as outlined in the prospectus of the fund.
The Companys overall currency positions and exposures are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Directors.

Sensitivity Analysis At 31 December 2010, had sterling strengthened by 5% in relation to the above currencies, with all other variables held constant, net assets attributable to shareholders and the change in net assets attributable to shareholders per the statement of comprehensive income would have decreased by the amounts shown below.

f Liquidity risk management The Company may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in instruments at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet liquidity requirements.
From time to time, the counterparties with which the Company effects transactions might cease making markets or quoting prices in certain of the instruments.
In such instances, the Company might be unable to enter into a desired transaction in currencies or other financial instruments, or to enter into any offsetting transaction with respect to an open position, which might adversely affect its performance.
Similarly, it may not always be possible for the Company to execute a buy or sell order on exchanges at the desired price or to liquidate an open position either due to market conditions or due to the operation of daily price fluctuation limits the maximum fluctuation permitted by some exchanges in the price of a futures or options contract during any trading day.
If trading on an exchange is suspended or restricted, the Company may not be able to execute trades or close out positions on terms which the Investment Adviser believes are desirable.

On a quarterly basis or more frequently, if deemed appropriate the Board reviews and considers the overall liquidity risk of the portfolio.
The Company has a secured variable funding note from Credit Suisse International of up to a maximum of 200 million or 25% of net assets whichever is the lower.

Financial Risk Management continued g Fair value measurements IFRS 7 requires the Company to classify fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
IFRS 7 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurements.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgment by the Company.
