Annual Report 2010 Explanation of Share Buy-Backs The impact of the Company buying in its own shares at a discount Shareholders have in the past questioned the benefit of buying in shares for cancellation.
Below is a hypothetical example of how buying in shares can improve the share price of an investment trust.
Typically, this happens in two ways: first, the buy-back, because it takes place at a discount, increases the NAV net asset value per share which, all other things being equal, leads to a rise in the share price: and, secondly, because a seller has been removed the discount may narrow, again leading to a rise in the share price.
Take an investment trust ABC whose shares are priced at 320p but which has a NAV per share of 400p.
There are 100 shares in the company.
NAV per share of ABC Investment Trust 400p Price per share of ABC Investment Trust 320p Discount of ABC Investment Trust 20% Value of ABC Investment Trust assets 100 x 400p 400 Market value of ABC Investment Trust 100 x 320p 320 If the company then buys back 15 shares at 320p the following happens: Value of buy-back 15 x 320p 48 As these shares are cancelled the value of the Companys total assets falls.
Value of Assets 400 48 352 But there are now only 85 shares in issue so the NAV per share is 352 85 414p, a rise of 14p 3.5%.
If the discount remains at 20% then the share price will rise to 80% x 414p 331p, an increase of 11p 3.4%.
In practice because a large seller has been removed, the discount may well fall.
Therefore, the share price may rise even more, benefiting all the remaining shareholders who will retain exactly the same number of shares.
