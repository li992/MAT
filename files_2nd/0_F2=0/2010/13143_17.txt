Deloitte Accountants B. V. A Sandler Auditors responsibility Amsterdam Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the parent company The Netherlands financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit 16 February 2011 in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing.
This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the parent company financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the parent company financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
