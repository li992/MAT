In addition, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense has been replaced with the Consolidated Statement of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures revised 1 January 2011 Comprehensive Income.
The revised standard requires this statement to present IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in Statements revised January 2008 1 July 2009 two linked statements.
The Group has elected to present two statements.
IAS 32 Amendment to IAS 32: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment.
The amended standard Classification of Rights Issues 1 February 2010 requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items 1 July 2009 Fair value measurements related to items recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for Improvements to IFRS issued April 2009 Various dates all financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The fair value measurement disclosures are presented in Note 22.

In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date Amendments consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Groups discretion to early adopt standards.

Discontinued operations On 21 September 2007 the Group disposed of the substantial proportion of its investment property and related business.
The remaining joint venture and associate undertakings with investment property interests are classified as discontinued operations.
The Directors intend to sell these properties within one year of the statement of financial position date and are looking for purchasers.
These assets remain classified as discontinued operations for an extended period as their potential commercial disposal has been adversely affected by the downturn in the commercial property market which is outside the control of the Group.
The Group remains committed to the plan to sell the assets and expects to sell them within one year.
The investment property at Debden was classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the prior year but has been reclassified in to continued operations in the current year because the property is expected to be held for more than 12 months before it will be disposed.
The comparative income statement balances have been restated where appropriate.
Discontinued rail services are also included in discontinued activities.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 10p shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of shares that would have been issued on exercise of all the dilutive options into ordinary shares.
The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations: Restated Restated Continuing Discontinued Total Continuing Discontinued Total Operations Operations Operations Operations 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 Numerator Profit used for basic earnings 28,992 770 28,222 19,342 28,113 8,771 Effect on earnings of dilutive potential ordinary shares 304 - 304 304 -- Diluted earnings 29,296 770 28,526 19,646 28,113 8,771 Report and Accounts 2010 68 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year to 28 February 2010, continued The adjusted earnings per share before the profit on disposal of the Widnes assets is 8.6p 2009: 7.7p.
The numerator used in calculating the normalised earnings per share before the profit on disposal of the Widnes assets of 20,557,000 2009: 16,600,000 is the profit before tax from continuing operations of 34,063,000 2009: 22,139,000 less the net profit on disposal of the Widnes assets after costs of 8,258,000 2009: nil less the credit for business purchase of nil 2009: 3,609,000, less impairment of investment property of nil 2009: 1,803,000 plus the restructuring costs of 2,746,000 2009: 2,722,000 and allowing for tax at 28% of 7,994,000 2009: 6,455,000.

These are potentially dilutive instruments but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive for the year and prior period as the average market price of the shares was lower than the exercise price.
The Income Shareholders had an option to convert their Income Shares into Ordinary shares at a rate of 0.854 Ordinary shares for each Income Share around 31 March 2010.
These are therefore dilutive instruments at the year end date.
On 9 April, 3,628,158 Income Shares were converted into 3,098,440 Ordinary shares.
On 10 March 2008, 3 July 2008 and 20 August 2009 respectively, 2.84m, 2.25m and 2.4m share options were granted to Directors and management under the Stobart Executive Incentive Plan with an exercise price of nil.
1,420,000 of these share options are included as dilutive instruments because all of the vesting conditions are met.
The remaining share options are not dilutive instruments as the vesting conditions have not been met unconditionally at the year end date.
This is not recognised as a liability as at 28 February 2010.

This brand name is considered to have an indefinite useful life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which it is expected to generate cash flows for the Group.
The Group invests significant amounts to support the brand profile and development.
Further details of the accounting for the acquisition in the year are set out in note 12.
Report and Accounts 2010 76 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year to 28 February 2010, continued Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives The goodwill and brands with indefinite lives from business combinations have been allocated to three cash-generating units.
Carrying amounts of goodwill and brands with indefinite lives allocated to each cash generating unit are set out below: Eddie Stobart Stobart Rail Stobart Ports Total 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Carrying amount of goodwill 141,642 133,614 4,375 4,375 25,269 25,269 171,286 163,258 Carrying amount of brands with indefinite useful lives 60,000 60,000 -- - - 60,000 60,000 Eddie Stobart cash-generating unit The recoverable amount of the goodwill in the Eddie Stobart cash-generating unit has been based on value in use calculations using projections from financial forecasts approved by senior management covering a 5-year 2009: 5 year period.
The main assumptions on which the forecasts were based include sales volumes and profit margins.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 7.3% 2009: 9.0%, taking in to account the cost of equity and debt for the CGU, and cash flows beyond the 5-year period are deemed to be in perpetuity but no growth 2009: nil is assumed in the calculations after 5 years.
No impairment losses have been recognised in the period or the prior period.
The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales volumes.
With regard to the assessment of value in the Eddie Stobart unit, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate or sales volumes would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Stobart Rail cash-generating unit The recoverable amount of the goodwill in the Stobart Rail cash-generating unit has been based on value in use calculations using projections from financial forecasts approved by senior management covering a 5-year 2009: 5 year period.
The main assumptions on which the forecasts were based include Network Rail work volumes.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.4% 9.9%, taking in to account the cost of equity and debt for the CGU, and cash flows beyond the 5- year period are deemed to be in perpetuity but no growth 2009: nil is assumed in the calculations after 5 years.
The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate.
With regard to the assessment of value in the Stobart Rail unit, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Stobart Ports cash-generating unit The recoverable amount of the goodwill in the Stobart Ports cash-generating unit has been based on fair value less costs to sell calculations using estimated discounted cash flows after tax and direct selling costs.
The calculations are based on projections from financial forecasts approved by senior management covering a 5-year 2009: 5 year period.
The main assumptions on which the forecasts were based include container volumes and profit margins.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 6.2% 2009: 7.0%, based on the weighted average cost of capital of the division, and cash flows beyond the 5-year period are deemed to be in perpetuity with a growth rate of 6.0% following the expected development of the port.
The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate, growth rate and container volumes.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by a significant amount.
In order for the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount, the value of the discount rate would need to be increased by approximately 50% and the value of the growth rate would need to be reduced by approximately 65%.
Investment Property Investment property in the prior year were carried at fair value and included in Assets Held for Sale, determined based on valuations performed by Knight Frank, an accredited independent valuer, as at 28 February 2009 on the basis of open market value, supported by market evidence.
The fair value represents the amount at which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction at the date of the valuation.
The valuation was performed in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and is based on available market evidence.
The Directors consider that there has been no material change to the valuation in the year based on an in-house review of the valuation.

81 Stobart Group Limited Financial Statements The book value and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows: Continuing Operations 2010 Book value Fair value 2010 2010 000 000 Financial assets Cash 13,134 13,134 Trade and other receivables 60,872 60,872 Financial liabilities Trade payables 29,227 29,227 Other payables 28,172 28,172 Overdrafts 26,436 26,436 Loans and borrowings 33,236 33,236 Finance leases and hire purchase arrangements 50,400 50,400 Interest rate swap 1,608 1,608 Continuing Operations 2009 Book value Fair value 2009 2009 000 000 Financial assets Cash 7,251 7,251 Trade and other receivables 55,997 55,997 Financial liabilities Trade payables 26,364 26,364 Other payables 22,667 22,667 Overdrafts 16,572 16,572 Loans and borrowings 58,181 58,181 Finance leases and hire purchase arrangements 53,389 53,389 For trade and other receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the carrying amount is considered to reflect the fair value.
The fair values of loans and borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: Quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorder fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Liabilities measured at fair value 28.02.2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap 1,608 - 1,608 - During the reporting period ending 28 February 2010, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
Financial instruments - Risk Management The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks: Credit risk Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk Liquidity risk Capital risk In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Report and Accounts 2010 82 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year to 28 February 2010, continued Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: Trade receivables Cash at bank Bank overdrafts Trade and other payables Floating-rate bank loans Income shares Finance leases Loan notes General objectives, policies and processes The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and polices.
The overall objective of the Board is to set polices that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales.
It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts.
Such credit ratings are taken into account by local business practices.
All credit sales are made under Group payment and delivery terms and conditions and are mostly covered by insurance.
All credit limits are formally set and are in agreement with the bank.
The recoverability of the net trade receivables book is considered highly likely.
This is supported by the history of collection by the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest risk from long-term borrowings and cash at variable rates.
It is Group policy that finance lease borrowings are taken at variable rates, previously these were fixed rates.
There are loan facilities at variable rates.
These borrowing policies are managed centrally.
The Group has also used interest rate caps and collars to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations though there are none in place at the year end.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
During 2010 and 2009, the Groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in Pounds Sterling.
At 28 February 2010, if interest rates on Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings had been 100 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, the annualised effect on the Groups profit before tax from continuing operations would be 571,000 2009: 613,000.
The impact on retained earnings, reflecting the after tax impact, would not be materially different.
During the year the Group has taken out an interest rate swap to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group has chosen to hedge account for this swap under IAS 39.
Cash flow hedge Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are held at fair value in the statement of financial position.
At 28 February 2010, the Group held an interest rate swap contract which was designated as hedges against a proportion of the interest cash flow payable in respect of its LIBOR floating rate borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts at 28 February 2010 is 1,608,000 2009: nil.
The interest rate hedges of the expected future interest cash flows was assessed to be highly effective and an unrealised loss of 1,608,000, with a deferred tax credit of 450,000 was included in other comprehensive income.
The principal amount of the swap was 28,825,000 at 28 February 2010 and reduces in equal quarterly installments of 175,000 to 25,500,000 by October 2014.
Capital management The objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratios.
Gearing based on net debt divided by capital was 31.7% at 28 February 2010 2009: 43.2%.
Gearing excluding fleet finance and financed fleet assets was 15.2% at 28 February 2010 2009: 25.5%.
The Group includes the following within borrowings: bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases and hire purchase contracts, income shares and loan notes.
Capital comprises equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The Group uses share capital to partly fund major acquisitions where considered appropriate.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital restraints.
Dividends are payable out of distributable profits after considering the forecast funding requirements and headroom.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
See also the maturity profile of loans and borrowings below.
The Group prepares rolling weekly 3-month cash flow projections and daily cash forecasts for the following week.
Actual cash and debt positions along with available facilities and headroom are reported weekly.
Working capital levels including analyses of receivables and payables profiles are reported by Division weekly.
These are monitored by Group management.
For the largest part of the business, cash is monitored against forecast and reported to Group management on a daily basis.
In addition, full annual 5-year forecasts are prepared including cash flow and headroom forecasts.
These are full detailed forecasts built up by Division and consolidated for the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis as the financial forecasts support the assumption that the Group will be able to meet its obligations when they fall due.

Report and Accounts 2010 84 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year to 28 February 2010, continued The fair value of the options granted without market based vesting conditions are estimated using a Black-Scholes model taking in to account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value of the options granted with market based vesting conditions are estimated using a Monte Carlo model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
During the year, 1,420,000 of the March 2008 options became fully vested and are exercisable at the year end.
The options under the Incentive Plan have no lapse date.
