Directors Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report, Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required by the International Accounting Standard IAS Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Group financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
IAS 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash ows.
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the denitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Boards Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.
This requires Directors to: O properly select and apply accounting policies: O present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: O provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specic requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Groups financial position and financial performance: and O make an assessment of the companys ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK Accounting Standards and applicable law.
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: O select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: O make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: O state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed: and O prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
