adjusted tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and non-recurring items adjusted tax charge amounted to a charge of 33.7 million 2009 44.3 million and the resulting rate is 13.7% 2009 22.1%.

a credit of nil relating to tax on foreign exchange losses 2009 27.9 million has been treated as exceptional as it matches foreign exchange losses of nil 2009 27.9 million on tax equalisation swaps included within finance costs see note 10.
Tax on other exceptional items includes a credit of 30.4 million 2009 nil relating to the recognition of further uK tax losses and other temporary differences which are treated as exceptional due to their material impact on the Groups adjusted tax charge.

The Group has decided to alter the presentation of its adjusted results.
From 4th october, 2010 the Group will cease to add back to its adjusted results the amortisation charged on internally generated and acquired computer software unless it was recognised as part of the accounting for a business combination.
This change will bring it into line with the practice of the majority of other companies.
had this change been made in the current financial year, adjusted profit before exceptional operating costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, other gains and losses and exceptional financing costs after taxation and non-controlling interests would have been 14.0 million lower at 177.8 million 2009 10.5 million lower at 130.2 million.
