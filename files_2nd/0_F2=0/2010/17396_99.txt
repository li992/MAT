A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used by the Group is the mid-market price.
Level 2 financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates.
The fair value of certicates of deposit is calculated as the present value of the future cash ows, discounted at an appropriate market rate of interest.
