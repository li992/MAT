FINANCIAL INSTRUMeNTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and through the use of bilateral facilities, overdrafts and cash with a range of maturity dates to ensure continuity of funding.
The economic climate, although improved, continues to provide a difficult backdrop to the Groups operations.
As such, the focus continues to be on managing cash flows and forward commitments, whilst continuing to marshal sites through the planning and remediation process and undertaking development on largely pre-let or pre-sold opportunities.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows for bank loans and overdrafts is shown in Note 14.
The maturity profile for the Groups other non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis is as follows: Less than 13 3 months 15 More than one month months to 1 year years 5 years Total 2010 m m m m m m Trade and other payables 18.3 8.8 13.3 47.3 67.7 155.4 Other payables on deferred terms 10.0 8.4 162.6 5.0 186.0 18.3 18.8 21.7 209.9 72.7 341.4 Less than 13 3 months 15 More than one month months to 1 year years 5 years Total 2009 m m m m m m Trade and other payables 16.5 11.6 12.6 22.4 67.7 130.8 Other payables on deferred terms 11.9 19.0 164.9 7.7 203.5 16.5 23.5 31.6 187.3 75.4 334.3 The Groups approach to cash flow, financing and bank covenants is discussed further in the financial review section of the business review on page 18.
