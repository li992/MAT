Notes to the financial statements For the year to 30 September 2010 1 Segmental disclosures The Group operates a single business segment of asset management for reporting and control purposes.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires disclosures to reflect the information which the Group Management Board, being the body that is the Group's chief operating decision maker, uses for evaluating performance and the allocation of resources.
During 2010, the Board decided that the Group's property asset management activities should no longer operate as a separately managed business and these operations have been fully integrated with other elements of the Group's operations.
As a result, the Group is now managed as a single asset management business, with multiple asset classes including equities, fixed income, property and alternative investment strategies that are managed across a range of products, distribution channels and geographic regions.
Reporting provided to the Group Management Board is on an aggregated basis.
Under IFRS 8, the Group is required to disclose by geographical location revenue and amounts of non-current assets other than financial instruments, deferred tax assets and retirement benefit assets.

80 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 5 Exceptional items The main elements of exceptional costs for 2010 related to the final element of costs arising from the migration and integration of the businesses bought from Credit Suisse in 2009.
This included charges in respect of transitional services provided by the vendor, costs of migration of the back office data and systems to the Group's third party administrator and costs of retaining duplicate staffing for a transitional period to ensure a smooth migration of data.
Advisory and legal fees incurred on the acquisition of the asset management business from The Royal Bank of Scotland as described in note 13, have been recognised as a cost, as required by amended financial reporting standards.
We have provided for all expected costs related to the remaining lease period for our former London office.
In economic terms, this cost is largely offset by the benefit of a rent-free period negotiated on the new office lease but IFRS does not permit these items to be netted.
The benefit of the rent-free period is being amortised over the lease term of 15 years within operating expenses.
Exceptional credits have been recognised in respect of the release of a surplus provision for possible VAT costs note 30 and receipt of contingent consideration of 0.7 million from the sale in 2009 of the Group's Belgian property business.
Exceptional costs in 2009 related to: i the costs in respect of the Credit Suisse acquisition as described above: ii nonrecurring rationalisation and redundancy costs were incurred in implementing a cost reduction programme: and iii one-off costs incurred in completing the integration of businesses acquired in the previous financial year, including office rationalisations.

Factors affecting future tax charge The Group's overseas profits are subject to overseas tax rates some of which are lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 28% 2009: 28%.
The Group will be able to benefit from the offset of tax losses brought forward from prior years against its taxable profits in future years.

Assuming approval of the final dividend payment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the subscription price will reduce from 92p per ordinary share to 90p per ordinary share.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 85 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 12 Earnings per share The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profits and numbers of shares.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the profit to exclude exceptional items and, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of exceptional and certain non-cash items.

"The Group has determined that it has two cash generating units ""CGUs"" for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets: i property asset management and ii investment management."
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
While no longer relevant to our current business model, we make estimated allocations of costs between the CGUs to enable continuity of assessment of impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to each segment is as follows: Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Investment management 956.9 937.2 65.1 306.5 Property asset management 177.4 210.4 1,134.3 1,147.6 65.1 306.5 Goodwill Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of various businesses over the years.
Additions to goodwill during the year relate to the assets acquired from The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as described below and final consideration paid in respect of the Credit Suisse acquisition.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing, as described below.
There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded at 30 September 2010.
88 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 13 Intangible assets continued Management contracts and distribution agreements Management contracts and distribution agreements arise on businesses combinations and as with goodwill they are allocated to appropriate CGUs.
They are recorded initially at their fair value and may be treated as indefinite life assets or definite life assets, in which case they are amortised.
Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles Goodwill The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use cash flow projections based on the Group's approved budget for the year to 30 September 2011 and take into account the market conditions prevailing at the time.
Value in use has been estimated by using a cashflow model, on the basis of five year projections plus a terminal value as required by IAS 36.
The cash flows have been based on the annual budget for the year to 30 September 2011 with a long term growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows for later years.
The long term growth rate assumption of 2% is in line with the long term nature of the Group's business and in line with the Board's view that the Group will operate as a going concern in the long term.
The principal assumptions used in the above analysis are: 2010 2009 % % Annual increase in equity assets under management 6.0 6.0 Annual increase in fixed income and alternatives assets under management 3.0 3.0 Annual increase in property assets under management 6.0 6.0 Annual increase in operating costs 5.5 5.5 The annual increases in operating costs assumed above include provision for inflation of salaries and other operating costs, as well as provision for the additional costs associated with the assumed increased levels of business.
The following discount rates have been used in the impairment analysis.
They are based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with a beta for the sector and allied to an equity risk premium.
The rates calculated for each CGU take into account the relative risks associated with each CGU.
The higher cost of capital for property is due to the smaller scale of these assets.

The sensitivity analysis included testing assumptions relating to future revenue growth and the assumptions surrounding the level of operating costs and margins.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were: 2010 2010 2009 2009 Investment Property asset Investment Property asset management management management management % % % % Discount rate 19.2 18.1 16.2 16.3 Long term growth rate 19.6 12.1 10.5 3.8 Inflation rate 21.9 9.9 12.7 7.5 The value in use, calculated for each CGU in accordance with the process described above, was compared with the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and property plant and equipment.
The comparison resulted in a surplus of value in use over the carrying value of these assets for both CGUs as shown in the table below, and therefore no impairment of goodwill has been recognised in the year.

Management contracts within the investment management CGU at 30 September 2010 include 99.3 million 2009: 369.9 million of assets which are considered to have an indefinite life.
These assets comprise contracts for the management of open end funds which have no limit of time or termination provisions.
The Group also reviewed definite life assets for impairment indicators and performed impairment tests where required.
The property management CGU has no management contracts that are considered to have an indefinite life.
The definite life assets include the distribution agreement acquired in the RBS acquisition.
Impairment tests were performed using a combination of value in use calculations using methods and assumptions described above in relation to goodwill and estimates of fair value less costs to sell.
Both measures of value were compared with the carrying value of the contracts.
During 2010, developments in the German property market have led to liquidity issues on open end funds managed by a number of groups, with many such funds having been closed to redemptions.
In common with a number of other groups, Aberdeen decided that it would place one such fund, DEGI Europa, into a controlled wind-down over a three year period, and we have taken this into account in considering future cashflows from this asset.
An impairment charge of 21.5 million has been recognised in the year to 30 September 2010 in respect of DEGI intangibles.
In 2009, an impairment charge of 12.7 million was recorded in respect of Australian management contracts.
The categories of management contracts and distribution agreements, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 30 September 2010 30 September 2009 Net book Remaining Estimated Net book Remaining Estimated values amortisation useful life values amortisation useful life m period years years m period years years Definite life - management contracts 337.4 2-9 6-10 94.1 3-8 6-10 Definite life - distribution contracts 39.2 4.3 5 Indefinite life - open end fund contracts 99.3 N A Indefinite 369.9 N A Indefinite 475.9 464.0 Company impairment review A review of goodwill and management contracts held by the Company was carried out on the same basis as described above in respect of the Group's intangible assets.
There were no indicators of impairment in respect of the management contracts held by the Company.
No impairment of goodwill or management contracts has been recognised in the year.
Acquisitions 2010 On 29 January 2010 the Group completed the acquisition of certain long only multi-manager and fund of alternatives management agreements and contracts from The Royal Bank of Scotland plc 'RBS' for a cash consideration of 84.7 million.
The benefits of the acquisition were to add fund of alternatives capability and strengthen the Group's distribution relationship with RBS Wealth Management, including Coutts.
The acquisition included the assignment of a number of asset administration, consultancy, advisory and other service agreements, certain trademarks, shares in certain Cayman Island companies and the associated staff of the business.
In addition, the Group has entered into a long-term distribution agreement with RBS, largely incorporating their private banking customer base at Coutts & Co.
Goodwill represents the value of the acquired workforce and synergies.
All goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
90 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 13 Intangible assets continued The Group and Company engaged external valuation specialists to advise on the correct allocation of the purchase price between goodwill, intangible assets and tangible assets.

This business has been integrated with the Group's existing asset management businesses therefore the results and cashflows can no longer be separately identified.
Acquisitions 2009 On 30 June 2009 the Group completed the second and final part of the acquisition of certain businesses and assets from Credit Suisse.
The acquisition was completed in two stages, the first part of which completed on 30 April 2009.
This was in respect of the businesses acquired in Asia Pacific ex Japan which had total assets under management of 7.1 billion.
The consideration for this part of the acquisition was satisfied by the issue of 32,536,196 new ordinary shares to Credit Suisse.
The second part of the acquisition was completed on 30 June 2009 and was in respect of the Rest of the World target business and had assets under management of approximately 28.0 billion bringing the total assets under management acquired to 35.1 billion.
The consideration for this part was satisfied by the issue of 207,473,804 new ordinary shares in the Company.
Combined with the consideration of new shares issued in respect of the first closing, a total of 240,000,000 new ordinary shares were issued to Credit Suisse in satisfaction of the purchase consideration.
The acquisition consisted primarily of investment management contracts, it also included several small operating companies in which 100% of the equity was acquired.
Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a purchase price allocation exercise in order to allocate the purchase price between tangible assets, goodwill and intangible assets.
The fair value adjustments from this allocation process are reflected in the table below.
Values for the net assets of the acquired business, at the date of acquisition, are set out in the table below.
4.4 million of final consideration was paid in 2010.
Further, we have clarified the tax treatment on deduction of amortisation.
As a result the deferred tax liability has been adjusted, with the corresponding entry reducing goodwill.
On 5 December 2009 the Group completed the sale of the former Credit Suisse funds acquired to Premier Asset Management Group Limited for a cash consideration of 23.0 million.

The fair value of unlisted investments have been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation guidelines for Limited Partnership agreements where possible.
Interest bearing loans The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar issues available in the market and the liquidity of the assets and liabilities.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated cash flows are based on management's best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.

They principally comprise available for sale investments and assets and other debtors.
The floating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and deposit balances which earn interest at rates which fluctuate according to money market rates.
Foreign net investment The majority of the Group's subsidiaries use sterling as their functional and presentation currencies.
The foreign currency net monetary assets of subsidiaries which adopt a different reporting currency are as follows: 2010 2009 m m US dollar 65.9 23.3 Singapore dollar 22.8 3.8 Australian dollar 20.3 23.9 Nordic currencies 2.4 4.9 Euro 24.3 18.6 Other 17.9 15.3 Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Group's life assurance subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which avail clients of a number of benefits from these pooled arrangements.
From the Group's perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to theses assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
While by necessity this Group subsidiary company has some insurance risks, these risks are completely reinsured, thereby negating any ultimate insurance risk to the Group's equity holders.
The unit linked assets are matched by the associated insurance contract liabilities disclosed in note 19.
The assets above are all unit linked and held for the sole benefit of the policyholders within Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.

36 Financial risk management Overview The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk Information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks is provided in this note which, describes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and ongoing management of the Group's risk management framework and the implementation and operation of the Board's policies are handled by the Group's risk management committee.
The Group's risk committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group's audit committee is responsible for overseeing financial reports and internal control.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers.
Debt levels are monitored locally by senior management and historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.
120 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 36 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group's facilities are described in Note 27.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest on the Group's borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily Sterling and U. S. dollars.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
The Group's investments in subsidiaries with U.
S dollar functional currency are hedged by the Group's 7.2% Subordinated notes 2016, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the subsidiary's net assets.
The Group's investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged as those currency positions are considered to be long-term in nature.
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities.
These securities are managed on a individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved by the Group Management Board.
Unit-linked assets The Group's balance sheet contains a significant level of assets relating to the Group's life and pensions subsidiary for which the risks and rewards fall to the benefit of or are borne by the underlying policyholders.
Therefore the investment contract liabilities shown in the Group's balance sheet are equal and opposite in value to the assets held on behalf of the policyholders.
As a result the Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of assets which are held on behalf of policyholders.
The Group's exposure in relation to these assets lies in the revenue earned from the assets which varies in line with the movement in value of the assets.
The Group has no exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default.
Stock of units and shares These represent units and shares of Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs which are operated and managed by the Group.
These are funds into which both institutional and retail investors can invest and the Group maintains a stock of units and shares in these funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Group's Risk Management Committee has set specific limits for the overall value of units which can be held by the Group at any one time and also placed a limit on the value of units held in any single fund.
Trade receivables and accrued income Trade receivables and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
The majority of the Group's asset management fees accrue based on daily, monthend or quarter-end asset values except performance fees which typically are earned based on annual performance.
Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
As a result, the average level for debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, will represent approximately 4 months revenue.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
Very few clients have external credit ratings.
Unit trust debtors The Group operates and manages a number of OEICs and in doing so it seeks as far as possible to match the purchase and sale of investments in order to match the receipt or payment of funds from or to clients.
Where these positions are not matched the Group may be required to fund any shortfall although due to the short settlement period for these transactions the risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small.
In addition should any investor default on any payment due the Group would be entitled to recover any costs from the investor.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 121 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 36 Financial risk management continued Cash and cash equivalents The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Group's risk management policy which is designed to manage the risks associated with the Group's cash and cash equivalent assets.
The treasury function for the Group is managed on a daily basis by the Group finance department who manage the Group's cash resources within guidelines set by the Board who receive regular reports on both the treasury and regulatory positions for the Group.
The main parameters within which the treasury function operates include: Cash placed on deposit Deposits are only placed with counterparties.
Foreign currency risk is managed in order to minimise, where possible, the risk of movement in exchange rates.
This involves the repatriation of cash held by overseas subsidiaries to Sterling and this is achieved by way of dividends from subsidiaries as well as the settlement of intercompany transfer pricing arrangements.
Cash placed on deposit may be subject to changes in interest rates and the Group manages its deposits to maximise the returns but at the same time ensuring that the Group's working capital requirements can be met.
Defined benefit pension deficit The Group operates three legacy defined benefit pension schemes in the UK as detailed in note 34.
The overall deficit in these schemes represent the discounted value of future pension obligations in excess of the value of the assets held by the schemes.
The Group is exposed to movements in the market values of the schemes assets as well as exposure to changes in interest rates which impact on certain scheme assets.
The pension obligations are quantified using corporate bond rates and therefore any movement in these rates can have a significant impact on the pension liabilities and therefore on the level of overall Group pension deficit.
Management of capital The Board's policy with respect to capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to provide a sufficient base to sustain the future development of the business while at the same time ensuring compliance with regulatory capital requirements.
The Board seeks to maintain higher returns than might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital.
The Company's Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Board monitors the composition of the shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in the share capital of the Company are provided in the director's report on page 41.
Movements in share capital during the year which include new shares issued to finance acquisitions as well as shares issued to satisfy share-based payment obligations are provided in note 23.
The Board gives careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for each acquisition which in the past have been structured to include both debt and equity funding.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Group's share-based payment schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Group Management Board.
Working capital The Group monitors the level of its working capital closely to ensure that it has sufficient cash available to meet its liabilities as they become due.
In addition, the Group's treasury function monitors cash balances on a daily basis.
Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital as prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
122 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 36 Financial risk management continued The Group currently holds a waiver obtained from the FSA from the requirement to meet the minimum capital requirement under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver has been in place since 3 August 2009 and is currently effective until 3 August 2014.
At 30 September 2010 there were 30 regulated companies in the Group, 7 of which are registered in the United Kingdom and are regulated by the FSA.
With the exception of Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited which is a regulated insurance firm, all others are regulated investment firms.
Only the regulated investment firms are part of the Group consolidation for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
The Group has 23 overseas regulated companies all of which are subject to regulatory capital requirements which are determined by their local regulator.
The measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resource Requirements CRR, which are referred to as the Pilar 1 capital requirements under CRD, are set out in regulatory rules.
The CRR for UK regulated investment firms is the higher of: the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and the fixed overhead requirement The credit risk relates to the risk of a third party becoming unable to meets its obligations to a firm.
The risk is calculated by using risk weighted percentages which are applied to the various exposure amounts.
Market risk represents the risk of a loss being incurred from fluctuations in exchange rates, calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firm's relevant fixed annual expenditure in the year's audited financial statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Group's regulated companies are required to submit returns quarterly or semi-annually and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
The Group is required, as part of the CRD, to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing on major risks, considering how the firm would cope with a significant market downturn for example, and an assessment of the Group's ability to mitigate the risks.
All the regulated companies in the Group maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout the year.
Pillar 3 market disclosures are available on the Group's website, www.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 123 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 37 Analysis of risks arising from financial instruments This note presents a numerical analysis of the Group's exposure to financial risk, as described in note 36.

The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should however be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: Sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% Market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1% Fair values of investments are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% at each reporting date The impact of the assumptions on the risk variables, net of tax, are as follows: Group Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2010 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling USD exchange rates 0.4 0.4 3.9 3.9 Sterling Euro 2.8 2.8 Sterling Nordic currencies 4.9 4.9 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 Financial investments available for sale 3.3 3.3 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2009 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling USD exchange rates 0.4 0.4 6.1 6.1 Sterling Euro 0.1 0.1 0.7 0.7 Sterling Nordic currencies 5.2 5.2 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Financial investments available for sale 3.4 3.4 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 132 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 37 Analysis of risks arising from financial instruments continued Company Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2010 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling USD exchange rates 0.4 0.4 6.7 6.7 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 Financial investments available for sale 0.4 0.4 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2009 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling USD exchange rates 0.4 0.4 7.7 7.7 Sterling Euro 0.1 0.1 2.7 2.7 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 Financial investments available for sale 0.8 0.8 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.7 v Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: - Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and - Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
