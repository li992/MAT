Financial Instruments In common with all businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and methods used to measure them are as follows: Principal financial instruments The principal instruments used by the Group, from which risks arise, are: 2010 2009 000 000 Other receivables 19,747 14,164 Trade receivables 20,527 21,315 Bank overdraft 210 273 Cash at bank 28,268 26,447 Secured bank loans 49,031 60,407 Fixed rate instalment mortgages 139,788 125,358 Trade and other payables 33,603 32,640 Derivative financial instruments 19,762 28,008 General objectives, policies and processes The Directors have overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, while retaining ultimate responsibility for them, have delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies, to the finance function.
The Board reviews information on properties on a regular basis, through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objectives of the Directors are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Financial Assets 2010 2009 000 000 Cash Sterling denominated 17,986 8,181 Cash USA dollar denominated 10,282 18,266 28,268 26,447 All cash balances receive interest at a variable rate with reference to LIBOR for sterling denominated balances and USA Prime rate for USA dollar denominated balances.
All cash balances are repayable on demand.
Cash balances are subject to interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk.
The group manages its interest rates by monitoring rates receivable and seeking to maximise returns.
Cash balances are generally held with major financial institutions, accordingly credit risk is not considered significant.
The group retains balances in US dollars.
Such amounts are not generally returned to the UK, but are held for future investment in the US.
The Group has trade and other receivables of 20,066,000 2009 20,039,000 and trade and other payables of 20,789,000 2009 26,759,000 denominated in USA dollars.
Current asset investments are denominated in Sterling.
Current asset investments, trade and other receivables and payables are included in these accounts at amortised cost which is considered to equate to their fair value.
qxd 22 7 10 5:17 pm Page 43 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2010 Financial Liabilities Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and repayments of its debt instruments.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole.
At 31 March 2010 gearing was 15.4%, on the basis of gross debt to total assets, and the level of debt due for repayment within one year was 3.5 million.
Cash balances at the year end were 26.2 million excluding tenants deposits.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities as they fall due and to achieve this aim it seeks to maintain cash balances to meet all requirements.
The Group seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates on a proportion of its long term borrowings while retaining some loans at floating rates in order to take advantage of interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity risk profile The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out below: 2010 2009 000 000 Within one year or less or on demand 3,523 6,598 Between one and two years 13,225 1,492 Between two and five years 48,498 38,982 After five years 123,783 138,966 189,029 186,038 The above profile represents the Groups capital maturity dates on its existing loan balances.
The undiscounted cash outflow from loans less than one year is 13.5 million.
The Group has undrawn borrowing facilities of nil 2009 nil expiring within one year and 41.6 million 2009 33.8 million expiring after five years.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing and foreign currency instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange, or other market factors.
Interest rate risk profile The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March, after taking account of interest rate instruments taken out by the Group was: 2010 2009 000 000 Floating rate liabilities Sterling denominated 24,241 35,680 Fixed rate liabilities Sterling denominated 48,116 33,325 Fixed rate liabilities USA dollar denominated 116,672 117,033 189,029 186,038 This includes floating rate debt which has been swapped to fixed rate.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise Sterling denominated bank borrowings bearing rates based on LIBOR.
qxd 22 7 10 5:17 pm Page 44 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The Group seeks to minimise the risk of sudden and unexpected rises in finance costs by the use of a mixture of fixed rate debt and financial derivative instruments while retaining the ability to take advantage of fluctuating interest rates.
There exists an interest rate risk to the Income Statement by the recognition of the fair values of the fixed rate debt and other interest rate hedging instruments.
At the year end the total value of the hedging instruments is a net 159.6 million.
The potential effect on the income statement of a 0.5% movement in interest rates is a movement of 4.0 million to the total value of the hedging instruments.
Foreign exchange risk The Group holds property and all related borrowings in US Dollars.
Consequently the Group has a degree of exposure to foreign currency risk.
As the Groups investments in the US are held for the long term and funds are not usually returned to the UK the Groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency transactions.
Instead management monitor exchange rates on a regular basis and elect to transfer funds between the UK and the US only when the rate is favourable to do so.
The potential impact of a 10% movement in the sterling to U. S. dollar exchange rate on the balance sheet net assets is 8.3 million.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk which arises principally from its trade receivables and other debtors.
It is the risk that another party fails to discharge its obligation in respect of these instruments.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables derive from the Groups rental income which in the main is demanded quarterly in advance.
Demands for rent are sent prior to the due date.
Payment of rent is made electronically or by cheque with some small amounts of rent occasionally received in cash.
Management monitors credit risk on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed and security deposits taken from new tenants.
It has long been the Groups policy to make full provision against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt.
A provision will usually be made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt.
At 31 March 2010 there were approximately 6.0 million of arrears which were more than a year old for which provisions have been made.
During the year the provision for irrecoverable debts increased by 1.0 million.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical areas the Directors do not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including financial instruments in the Balance Sheet.
Hedge profile type and maturity of protection The Group has a number of fixed rate mortgages.
The weighted average interest rate on these mortgages was 6.07% 2009 6.04% and the weighted average period for which the borrowing is fixed at 31 March 2010 was 10 years 2009 9 years.
The Group has 26.6 million 2009 28.8 million of fixed rate swaps which mature in 2010 and 25.0 million 2009 25.0 million of fixed rate swaps which mature in 2018.
The weighted average interest rate is 6.8%.
Details of Financial Risk Management are set out in the Directors Report.
