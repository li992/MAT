Notes For the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2010 1 aCCoUNtINg PoLICIes Basis of preparation These financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2010 2009: 52 weeks ended 3 October 2009 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC and Standing Interpretations Committee SIC interpretations adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain items, principally land and buildings, derivative financial instruments, pension commitments and share-based payments.
New standards, interpretations and accounting developments The new accounting standards and interpretations which were effective in the current period and have impacted, or are likely to have a future impact on, the financial statements are as follows: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment The adoption of the amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in respect of vesting conditions and cancellations requires the Group to take non-vesting conditions into account when determining the fair value of its share-based payments.
In addition, all cancellations of share-based payments, whether by the Group or by employees, are accounted for in an identical manner and require the immediate acceleration of any costs unrecognised at the date of cancellation.
This amendment applies retrospectively, but the impact on previous periods has been assessed as immaterial and hence no prior period adjustment has been recorded.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments The adoption of IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the Group to present segment information on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
There are no changes to the segments previously presented, as the operating segments set out in note 2 are consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements The adoption of the revised IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires the Group to present a Statement of Comprehensive Income rather than a Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and a Statement of Changes in Equity.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure The adoption of the amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure requires the Group to make enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations The adoption of the amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires the Group to make a number of changes in how it accounts for any business combinations occurring on or after the start of the current period.
These changes include the expensing of all acquisition-related costs, and recording all payments to purchase a business at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt and subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRIC have issued the following new or revised standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Amendments relating to oil and gas assets and determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2010 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters 1 July 2010 IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Amendments relating to Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions 1 January 2010 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Revised definition of related parties 1 January 2011 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendments relating to classification of rights issues 1 February 2010 52 18528.04 3 12 2010 Proof 7 FINaNCIaL stateMeNts 1 aCCoUNtINg PoLICIes CoNtINUeD The IASB have also issued a number of minor amendments to standards as part of their Annual Improvements to IFRS.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the above amendments will have a material impact on the Groups reported income or net assets in the period of adoption.
The Group continues to evaluate standards and interpretations and the impact on the financial statements.
The UK government recently announced its intention to change the measure of inflation for the purposes of statutory minimum rates at which pensions must increase for public and private sector defined benefit schemes.
This change would reference the consumer prices index CPI as the measure of inflation rather than the retail prices index RPI as is currently the case.
The UITF has reached a draft consensus that recognition of the change depends on whether there is a legal or constructive obligation to pay pensions with increases based on at least RPI or more generally to inflation linked increases.
The Group is currently considering the implications of this change with regards to its defined benefit pension scheme.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of Marstons PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group accounts from the date on which control transferred to the Group or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration paid and deferred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consolidated financial statements also incorporate the results of Marstons Issuer PLC, a company set up with the sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group.
The Directors of Marstons PLC consider this company meets the definition of a special purpose entity under SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary undertaking.
Details of this company are provided in note 32. revenue and other operating income Revenue represents the value of goods principally drink and food and services principally accommodation and gaming machines supplied to customers, and rents receivable from licensed properties.
Revenue for drink, food and accommodation is recognised at the point at which the goods or services are provided.
Gaming machine income is recognised as earned.
Rental income is recognised in respect of the period to which it relates.
Revenue is recorded net of discounts, intra-Group transactions, VAT, and excise duty relating to the brewing and packaging of certain products.
Other operating income comprises mainly rents receivable from unlicensed properties, which is recognised in respect of the period to which it relates.
operating segments For segment reporting purposes the Group is considered to have four distinguishable operating segments, being Marstons Inns and Taverns, Marstons Pub Company, Marstons Beer Company and Marstons Group Services.
This mirrors the Groups internal organisation and management structure, and reflects the different risk profiles to which the business is exposed.
An element of Marstons Group Services costs is allocated to each of the trading divisions.
The operating segments set out in note 2 are consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
For the purposes of IFRS 8 the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive Directors.
Acquired businesses are treated as separate reporting segments, where material, until they have been fully integrated with the Groups trading divisions.
exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.

Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value of these assets can be identified separately and measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset.
Where the useful life of the asset is considered to be indefinite no annual amortisation is provided but the asset is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Impairment reviews are carried out more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired.
The useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are: Acquired brands Indefinite Lease premiums Life of the lease Computer software 5 to 10 years Development costs 10 years Any impairment of carrying value is charged to the income statement.
research and development expenditure All expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is expensed as incurred.
Development costs are recognised as an intangible asset when the following conditions are met: It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use: Management intends to complete the asset and use or sell it: There is an ability to use or sell the asset: It can be demonstrated how the asset will generate probable future economic benefits: Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset are available: and The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be reliably measured.
Other development expenditure that does not meet these criteria is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated at operating segment level.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold and leasehold properties are initially stated at cost and subsequently at valuation.
Plant and machinery and fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to provide for the cost of the assets less residual value over their useful lives.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated over the life of the lease.
Plant and machinery and fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
Own labour and interest costs directly attributable to capital projects are capitalised.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
54 18528.04 3 12 2010 Proof 7 FINaNCIaL stateMeNts 1 aCCoUNtINg PoLICIes CoNtINUeD Valuation of properties Properties are revalued by qualified valuers on a sufficiently regular basis using open market value so that the carrying value of an asset does not differ significantly from its fair value at the balance sheet date.
Substantially all of the Groups properties have been externally valued in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Red Book and these valuations are performed directly by reference to observable prices in an active market or recent market transactions on arms length terms.
Internal valuations are performed on the same basis.
The estate is reviewed for indication of impairment at each reporting date, using a process focusing on areas of risk and business performance throughout the portfolio to identify any exposure.
Impairment losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, and thereafter to the income statement.
Surpluses on revaluation are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where they reverse previously charged impairment losses, in which case they are recorded in the income statement.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment represents net sale proceeds less the carrying value of the assets.
Any element of the revaluation reserve relating to the property disposed of is transferred to retained earnings at the date of sale.
Impairment If there are indications of impairment or reversal of impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair market value less costs to sell.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased, a reversal of the loss is made if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement.
The depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
There is no reversal of impairment losses relating to goodwill.
Acquired brands are reviewed for impairment on a portfolio basis.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The cost of the assets held under finance leases is included within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is charged in accordance with the accounting policy for each class of asset concerned.
The corresponding capital obligations under these leases are shown as liabilities.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement and classified within finance costs as incurred.
Rental costs under operating leases, including lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Similarly, income receivable under operating leases is credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
other non-current assets Other non-current assets represent trade loans.
In common with other major brewers the Group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the Groups beer.
These trade loans are classified as loans and receivables and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Significant trade loans are secured against the property of the loan recipient.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued on a first in, first out basis, with the exception of hops which are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress include direct materials, labour and a proportion of attributable overheads.

This condition is met when the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is being actively marketed.
In addition, the Group must be committed to the sale and the completion should be expected to occur within one year from the date of classification.
Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits on call with banks.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of the Groups financial instruments at initial recognition.
a Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives are categorised as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as part of a hedge relationship.
The Group holds no other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, other receivables, trade loans and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the income statement within exceptional finance costs or income in the period in which they arise.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Preference shares are classified as liabilities.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as finance costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
56 18528.04 3 12 2010 Proof 7 FINaNCIaL stateMeNts 1 aCCoUNtINg PoLICIes CoNtINUeD Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Accrued interest is recognised separately in current liabilities.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
Amounts that have been recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges are reclassified from equity to profit and loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction occurs.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Trade receivables and other receivables Trade receivables and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade or other receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and estimated future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within other operating charges.
When a trade or other receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade or other receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other operating charges in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
employee benefits Pension costs for the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are determined by the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial calculations being carried out at each period end date.
Costs are recognised separately as operating and finance costs in the income statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, any income or expenses on settlements or curtailments, and past service costs where the benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the interest on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising differences between the actual and expected return on scheme assets, changes in scheme liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.

Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Post-retirement medical benefits are accounted for in an identical way to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
Key management personnel Key management personnel are those who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
In the case of Marstons PLC the only key management personnel are considered to be the Directors of the Group.
Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Differences are defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a deficit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as provisions.
These provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation are the market rents and vacant periods of the properties together with the discount rate.
Other contractual property costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
share-based payments The fair value of share-based remuneration at the date of grant is calculated using the BlackScholes option-pricing model and charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the income statement takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions contained within IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and has only applied this accounting policy to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002.
Awards granted prior to 7 November 2002 are not charged to the income statement.
Non-vesting conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value of the Groups share-based payments, and all cancellations of share-based payments, whether by the Group or by employees, are accounted for in an identical manner with any costs unrecognised at the date of cancellation being immediately accelerated.
own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares, shares held within a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and shares held within an Executive Share Option Plan ESOP, which are used for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to equity.
No income or expense is recognised in the performance statements on treasury share transactions.
58 18528.04 3 12 2010 Proof 7 FINaNCIaL stateMeNts 1 aCCoUNtINg PoLICIes CoNtINUeD Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
transactions and balance sheet items in a foreign currency Transactions in a foreign currency are translated to sterling using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary receivables and payables are remeasured at closing day rates at each balance sheet date.
Exchange gains or losses that arise from such remeasurement and on settlement of the transaction are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences for non-monetary assets valued at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Gains or losses on disposal of nonmonetary assets are recognised in the income statement.
Key assumptions and significant judgements IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Groups key assumptions and significant judgements are in respect of property, plant and equipment, impairment, pension liabilities, financial instruments, property lease provisions and share-based payments.
Details of these assumptions and judgements are set out in the relevant accounting policy and detailed note to the financial statements as set out below: Property, plant and equipment Valuation of properties see accounting policy.
Assets useful lives and residual values see accounting policy.
Impairment Assumptions made in the value in use calculation, in particular the pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections and the growth rate used to extrapolate projected cash flows beyond one year budgets notes 10 and 11.
Pension liabilities Actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, rates of increase in pensionable salaries, rates of increase in pensions, inflation rates, expected returns on scheme assets, and life expectancies note 25.
Financial instruments Valuation of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market note 20.
Property lease provisions Assumptions made in the discounted cash flow calculation, in particular market rents, vacant periods and discount rates see accounting policy.
Share-based payments Inputs to the BlackScholes option-pricing model, which include dividend yield, expected volatilities, and risk free interest rates note 26.

This relates to an additional provision for some onerous leases recognised in the prior period where market conditions have deteriorated, and a provision for rent payments following the reversion of onerous leases to the Group in the current period.
Property related insurance claims Property related insurance claim costs of 2.1 million have been incurred during the period, principally relating to flooding and fire claims.
The Groups properties in the Lake District, including the Jennings Brewery and local pubs in particular, suffered significant flood damage during the period.
A condition of the Groups insurance policy is that it is responsible for a portion of the claims.
VAT refund During the period a refund of 5.1 million was received from HM Revenue & Customs in relation to VAT on gaming machine income.
It followed Tribunal Court of Appeal hearings involving The Rank Group Plc.
Points raised during the Rank case have been referred to the European Court of Justice and are due to be heard in 2011.
HM Revenue & Customs have issued protective assessments to recover the repayment in the event they are successful with their appeal.
The Group has appealed against these protective assessments, but if HM Revenue & Customs are successful upon appeal, the Group would be required to repay the 5.1 million plus interest.
A gain of 4.7 million net of associated fees has been recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement, and the potential refund has been recorded as a contingent liability in note 34.
Movement in fair value of interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date and the movement is recognised in the income statement unless hedge accounting is applied.
The movement of 4.7 million 2009: 11.9 million in the fair value of swaps, where hedge accounting has not been applied, is shown as an exceptional item.
Impact of taxation The current tax credit relating to the above exceptional items amounts to 7.8 million 2009: 0.2 million.
The deferred tax credit relating to the above exceptional items amounts to 1.5 million 2009: 9.5 million.
In addition, 2.1 million 2009: nil has been credited as exceptional in relation to the change in corporation tax rate note 7.
Prior period exceptional items Two impairment exercises were undertaken during the prior period.
The first review predominantly focused on tenanted pubs let on nonsubstantive agreements and the second review predominantly focused on leasehold town centre pubs.
These categories of pubs were considered to be those most affected by the weakened UK economy.
The total impairment identified was 68.0 million which was taken either to the income statement as an exceptional item or, where the impairment reversed a previous upwards valuation, to the revaluation reserve.

Where these are identified the impairment calculations are performed at an individual pub level.
The Group estimated the above impairments on the basis of fair market value less costs to sell.
Pubs which were being marketed for sale had been transferred to assets held for sale note 15 as appropriate.
The key assumptions in determining the level of impairment were the estimated market value based on specialist advice and the timeframe within which those pubs could be sold.
As part of the overall review of properties, a full assessment of property provisions was undertaken to reflect the most recent circumstances and expectations.
A number of onerous lease and other property related provisions were identified during the review and these were recognised in provisions for other liabilities and charges.
These were considered to be linked to the exceptional events which impacted the estate as noted above.

Recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 115.2 million 2009: 115.2 million to Marstons Inns and Taverns, 85.4 million 2009: 85.4 million to Marstons Pub Company and 23.6 million 2009: 23.6 million to Marstons Beer Company.
Goodwill has been allocated to business segments based on the extent to which the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The key assumptions used in determining value in use are the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of 7.5% 2009: 9.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets of 2.0% 2009: 2.0% in line with an expected long-term growth rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Risk factors are considered to be similar in each of the Groups trading divisions.
Other commercial assumptions relate to market growth, market share and net selling prices.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
These estimates take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and assessments of competitors strategy.
The above impairment tests demonstrated that the Group had substantial levels of headroom and as such no impairment of goodwill was required in the current or prior period.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market, such as over-the-counter derivatives, is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 17.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans, and the carrying value of trade payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.

Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Market risk: The Groups market risk is explained in detail in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 31 to 36.
Interest rate risk: The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, and as such the Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.

The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate payable on the floating rate tranches of its securitised debt note 19.
These derivative financial instruments have qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, and, as a result, changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge.
The losses taken directly to other comprehensive income in the period totalled 30.8 million 2009: 39.3 million.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 2 October 2010 totalled 491.0 million 2009: 510.4 million.
The interest rate swaps, including borrowing margins, fix interest at 5.4% and 6.0%.
On 1 October 2007 the Group entered into two interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These derivative financial instruments have not qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, and, as a result, changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement.
The losses taken to the income statement in the period totalled 4.7 million 2009: 11.9 million note 4.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 2 October 2010 totalled 140.0 million 2009: 140.0 million.
The interest rate swaps fix interest at 5.5% and 5.6%.
On 20 May 2009 the Group entered into a further interest rate swap of 20.0 million to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
This derivative financial instrument qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, and, as a result, changes in fair value have been recognised in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge.
The gains taken directly to other comprehensive income in the period totalled 0.1 million 2009: losses of 0.1 million.
The notional principal amount of this interest rate swap contract at 2 October 2010 totalled nil 2009: 20.0 million.
The interest rate swap fixed interest at 1.1%.
This interest rate swap contract terminated on 8 August 2010.
On the same day the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap of 20.0 million to continue to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
This derivative financial instrument has qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, and, as a result, changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge.
The losses taken directly to other comprehensive income in the period totalled 1.3 million 2009: gains of 0.1 million.
The notional principal amount of this interest rate swap contract at 2 October 2010 was 20.0 million 2009: 20.0 million.
The interest rate swap fixes interest at 3.3%.
This interest rate swap commenced on 9 August 2010 and terminates on 8 August 2013.

Foreign currency risk: The Group buys and sells goods denominated in non-sterling currencies, principally US dollars and euros.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Groups income and expenditure.
The Groups exposure in this area is not considered to be significant.
78 18528.04 3 12 2010 Proof 7 FINaNCIaL stateMeNts 20 FINaNCIaL INstrUMeNts CoNtINUeD Counterparty risk: The Groups counterparty risk in respect of its cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by the use of various banking institutions for its deposits.
There is no significant concentration of counterparty risk in respect of the Groups pension assets, as these are held with a range of institutions.
Credit risk: Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, an assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of and adherence to credit limits are regularly monitored.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables, other receivables and free trade loans has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits and fixtures and fittings.
Receivables are written off against the provision for impairment when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of its customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.
Liquidity risk: The Group applies a prudent liquidity risk management policy, which involves maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
In addition, the Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements, and maintaining debt financing plans.
The Groups borrowing covenants are subject to regular review.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and non-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

b Executive Share Option Plan ESOP.
Under this scheme executive share options are awarded at the prevailing market rate on the date of the grant.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years after grant and upon the achievement of performance criteria in relation to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 39. c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted that will only vest provided the participant satisfies the minimum shareholding requirement and performance conditions relating to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 39, are met.
During the current period a minor amendment was made to the rules of the LTIP.
As such, awards made in 2010 are structured as Approved Performance Share Plan APSP awards and comprise an HM Revenue & Customs approved award in respect of the first 30,000 worth of an award, and an unapproved LTIP award for amounts in excess of this HM Revenue & Customs limit.
The approved options are granted at the market price of the shares on the date of grant whereas the unapproved options have a nil cost.
To enable participants to fund the exercise of the approved option a further share award is also now provided.
This linked award is a nil cost option granted over a flexible number of shares so that when it vests and is exercised, it delivers a value equal to the total exercise price of the approved options.
This linked award is satisfied by a number of shares from the Companys employee benefit trust which are used to fund the approved option exercise price.
These shares are then retained by the trust and not delivered to the participant.
Under these amended rules the LTIP options are still issued at nil cost to the employee.
The tables below summarise outstanding options that were issued after 7 November 2002.

The fair values of the SAYE, ESOP and LTIP rights are calculated at the date of grant using the BlackScholes option-pricing model.
The significant inputs into the model for all schemes unless otherwise stated, were: 2010 2009 Dividend yield % 6.5 8.4 Expected volatility % 39.5 to 55.7 36.5 to 50.9 Risk free interest rate % 1.5 to 3.0 2.4 to 3.3 Expected life of rights SAYE 3 to 7 years 3 to 7 years ESOP 3 years 3 years LTIP 3 years 3 years The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected life of the rights.
The performance criteria of the ESOP and LTIP, as set out previously, are built into the pricing model.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the SAYE was 18.2p 2009: 27.1p.
The fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the LTIP was nil 2009: nil.
The weighted average share price for options exercised over the period was 93.6p 2009: 108.1p.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 0.1 million 2009: credit of 0.4 million, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After tax, the total charge was 0.1 million 2009: credit of 0.3 million.

34 CoNtINgeNt LIaBILItIes aND FINaNCIaL CoMMItMeNts On 9 August 2005 the Group entered into a Tax Deed of Covenant, which was amended on 22 November 2007, the primary objective of which was to ensure that the Group did not trigger a fide-grouping liability comprising Capital Gains Tax CGT and Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT.
This would arise in the event of Marstons Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group, within six years of the relevant asset transfer date for CGT purposes, and within three years of the relevant asset transfer date for SDLT purposes.
Due to the passage of time, and changes in the statutory rate of corporation tax, the total fide-grouping liability now stands at 173.8 million, of which 163.6 million relates to CGT and 10.2 million relates to SDLT.
During the period a refund of 5.1 million was received from HM Revenue & Customs, in relation to VAT on gaming machine income.
The likelihood of such a repayment being required is not considered probable.
A gain of 4.7 million net of associated fees has been recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement in note 4.
The Group has issued a letter of credit in favour of Royal Sun Alliance Insurance totalling 3.9 million 2009: 3.9 million to secure reinsurance contracts.
The letter of credit is secured on fixed deposit for the same amount.
The Group has also entered into a Deed of Guarantee with the trustees of the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme whereby it guarantees to the Trustees the ongoing obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme, and the obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme in the event of a debt becoming due under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 on the occurrence of either a Group company entering liquidation or the Scheme winding up.
