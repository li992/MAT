Deferred taxation Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision, without discounting is made for all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at fair value.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Companys activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Companys treasury policy as approved by the Board of Directors.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is either recognised immediately in the pro t and loss account or, if the underlying derivative quali es for cash ow hedge accounting, then the gain or loss is recognised in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Synergy Health plc 94 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Principal company accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or a forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For cash ow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the pro t and loss account in the same period in which the hedged item affects the pro t and loss account.
When a cash ow hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the pro t and loss account.
Retirement bene ts fide ned contribution pension schemes The pension costs charged against operating pro ts are the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Government grants Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account within creditors and are released to the pro t and loss account by equal annual instalments over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets.
Government grants of a revenue nature are credited to the pro t and loss account in the same period as the related expenditure.
Leased assets Assets held under hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the pro t and loss account over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the pro t and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost except where they have experienced a permanent diminution in value.
Where shares have been issued to acquire a subsidiary, the cost of the investment is the market value of the Companys shares on the date the transaction took place.
Synergy Health plc 95 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 1 Principal company accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the date of grant of the equity-settled share-based payments and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re ect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to growth in the Companys total shareholder return not achieving the growth threshold for vesting.
The Company also provides employees with the option to purchase the Companys ordinary shares at a discount of 20% of market value on the date of grant.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 3 April 2005.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Cash ow and related party transactions Under the provisions of FRS 1 Cash ow statements revised, the Company has not presented a cash ow statement because the consolidated financial statements contain a cash ow statement.
Under the provisions of FRS 8 Related party disclosures, the Company has not disclosed details of inter-Group transactions because consolidated financial statements have been prepared.
