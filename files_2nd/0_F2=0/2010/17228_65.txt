39 PenSionS a Defined benefit pension scheme The Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at 6 April 2007 and were updated for FRS 17 Retirement benefits purposes for the periods to 31 January 2010, 1 February 2009 and 3 February 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
Following consultation with members and approval by the Board of Trustees, the Company became committed to the final proposals from the Pension Review on 2 July 2009.
The move from a final salary basis to career average revalued earnings CARE represents an accounting curtailment of certain pension liabilities.
In accordance with FRS 17, the defined pension schemes obligations were revalued by the schemes actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
As a result a credit of 39m has been recognised in the profit and loss account during the year.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 1 February 2010 is 22m 2009: 25m.
b assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below.
The assumptions used at the valuation date of 2 July 2009, used in calculating the pensions credit of 39m, remained the same as the prior year end 1 February 2009 apart from the discount rate, which reduced from 6.25% to 6.0%.

The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as Long Cohort and is in-line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up to date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is PNX00 YOB 2009 and 2008: PNX00 YOB LC.
