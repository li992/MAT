Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group and Company financial statements, with the exception of new standards and interpretations which have been adopted with effect from 1 July 2009 as disclosed in policy note a below.
a Basis of preparation Group and Company The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Based on these adopted IFRS, the Directors have selected the accounting policies to be applied, which are set out below.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of derivative financial instruments and certain financial assets that are held as available-for-sale.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 which allows it not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes.
With effect from 1 July 2009, the Group adopted the following new standards and interpretations: IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Amended: Cost of an investment in Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate This standard has been amended to clarify the initial measurement of cost in the separate financial statements of a new parent formed as the result of a reorganisation.
The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IFRS 2 Amended: Share-based Payments This standard has been amended to clarify the definition of vesting conditions.
Theamended standard also requires a cancellation of a share-based award, whether by the entity or other parties, to be accounted for as an acceleration or modification of the vesting period.
Theadoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IFRS 3 Amended: Business Combinations This amended standard changes the accounting applied to the acquisition of non-controlling interests and the loss of control of subsidiaries.
Adoption of this amended standard has had no impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IFRS 7 Amended: Financial Instruments: Disclosures The amended standard requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity risk.
Among other things, the new disclosures: add disclosure of any change in the method for determining fair value and the reasons for the change establish a three-level hierarchy for making fair value measurements: 1. quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : 2. inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that ar e observable for the asset or liability, either directly ieasprices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 2 : and 3. inputs for the asset or liability that ar e not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 3. add disclosure, for each fair value measurement in the statement of financial position, of which level in the hierarchy was used and any transfers between levels, with additional disclosures whenever Level 3 is used including a measure of sensitivity to a change in input data add disclosure of a maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities.
IFRS 8: Operating Segments This standard requires disclosure of information about the Groups operating segments and replaces the requirement to determine primary and secondary reporting segments of the Group.
Additional disclosures are also required for single segment businesses, including information about major customers and the location of material non-current assets.
Adoption of this standard had no material impact on the disclosure in the accounts since management continue to regard the Groups services as comprising one business segment being provision of investment management services and that its operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis.
Disclosure regarding significant revenue sources is given in note 2.
No additional disclosure is required for non-current assets on the basis that all material non-current assets are held in the UK.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 58 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 01 11 12 27 28 48 49 88 IAS 1 Amended: Presentation of Financial Statements This amended standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income, which presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
TheGroup has elected to present a single statement in the form a consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
IAS 27 Amended: Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Changes to IAS 27 and IFRS 3 work together such that a business combination leading to acquisition accounting applies only at the point where control is achieved.
Theamended standard also identifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within shareholders equity.
IAS 39 Amended: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The amendments make clear that the intrinsic value, not the time value, of an option reflects a one-sided risk and therefore an option designated in its entirety cannot be perfectly effective.
The time value of a purchased option is not a component of the forecast transaction that impacts profit or loss.
Therefore, if an entity designates an option in its entirety as a hedge of a onesided risk arising from a forecast transaction, hedge ineffectiveness will arise.
Adoption of this amended standard has had no impact on the financial performance or position of the Group as the Group excludes all time value from all hedges.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
Thefinancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Theresults of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
iii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence exists when the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not control those policies.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method as described under IAS 28, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Companys share of net assets of the investee.
iv Employee Benefit Trust An Employee Benefit Trust EBT acts as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based compensation plans.
Accordingly, the EBT is included within the Groups consolidated financial statements.
c Foreign currency translation The Groups financial statements are presented in pounds sterling sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Therevenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 59 Notes to the financial statements continued d Financial instruments i Derivatives The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage its foreign currency exposures.
Except when hedge accounting is applied, derivatives are initially recognised at cost on the date on which a contract is entered into unless fair value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case the fair value is recognised.
Subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Transaction costs are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Thefair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
All derivatives are carried as current assets when the fair value is positive and as current liabilities when the fair value is negative.
ii Financial assets The Group may, from time-to-time, invest in funds where an Ashmore Group subsidiary is the investment manager or an advisor seeding.
Where the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling stake and is acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution, these seed investments are recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5.
Where control is not deemed to exist, and the assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as available-for-sale financial assets.
Where the assets are not readily realisable, they are recognised as non-current asset investments.
The recognition policy for the three categories is set out below: Non-current asset investments Non-current asset investments, relating to closed-end funds, are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair value is assessed by taking account of the extent to which potential dilution of gains or losses may arise as a result of additional investors subscribing to the fund where the final close of a fund has not occurred.
Financial assets held as non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except where measurement and re-measurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5.
Therelevant policy is set out in d i.
Where investments that have initially been recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale, because the Group has been deemed as holding a controlling stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted such that the Groups holding is now insufficient to be deemed a controlling stake, the investment will subsequently be reclassified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
Any such reclassification will crystallise any gain or loss previously recognised through other comprehensive income within profit for the year as part of comprehensive income.
Subsequent movements will be recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for the newly adopted classification.
Financial assets held as available-for-sale For available-for-sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in profit for the year as part of comprehensive income.
iii Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs.
Thefair value on acquisition is normally the cost.
Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable amount are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other receivables are impaired.
However, if a longer-term loan or receivable carries no interest, the fair value is estimated as the present value of all future cash payments or receipts discounted using the prevailing market rates.
Theresulting adjustment is recognised as interest expense or interest income.
Subsequent to initial recognition these assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost less anyimpairment.
iv Hedge accounting The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria.
To qualify, the following conditions must be met: formal documentation of the relationship between the hedging instrument s and hedged item s must exist at inception: the hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit and loss: the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured: and the hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness assessed on an ongoing basis.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 60 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 01 11 12 27 28 48 49 88 For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the effective hedging instrument, is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and is released to profit for the year as part of comprehensive income in the same period during which the relevant financial asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where highly effective, any ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in profit and loss.
Where the instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment includes leasehold improvements and office equipment, and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Theuseful life of office equipment is estimated to be five years.
In respect of leasehold improvements depreciation is charged over the remaining life of the lease or over the useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.
Theresidual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually.
f Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
g Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Forthe purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
h Deferred acquisition costs Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management contract are deferred if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are charged as the related revenue is recognised.
i Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Forgoodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Foran asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
j Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders.
k Employee benefits Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income when payable in accordance with the scheme particulars.
l Share-based payments The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based compensation plans.
Theawards have been classified as equity settled under IFRS 2: Share-Based Payments.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 61 Notes to the financial statements continued The fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Thefair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period.
Thefair value is measured using an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
m Own shares Own shares are held by the EBT.
Theholding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group.
In both the Group and Company own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from retained earnings.
n Treasury shares Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to retained earnings.
o Revenue Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees and other revenue.
Revenue is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as and when the related services are provided.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Specific revenue recognition policies are: i Management fees Management fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Where management fees are received in advance these are recognised over the period of the provision of the asset management service, which is estimated based on experience of average holding periods for investments.
ii Performance fees Performance fees relate to the performance of funds managed during the period and are recognised at the balance sheet date when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise.
This is usually at the end of the performance period.
iii Other revenue Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the Group.
Thisrevenue is recognised when the related services are provided.
p Distribution costs Distribution costs are the cost-of-sales payable to third parties and are recognised over the period for which the service is provided.
q Operating leases Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded as a reduction in premises costs.
r Finance income Finance income includes interest receivable on the Groups cash and cash equivalents and gains on available-for-sale held-forsale assets.
Gains on available-for-sale held-for-sale assets recognised in the year arose either as a result of crystallisation on disposal of an available-for-sale asset or upon reclassification of financial assets previously held as non-current assets held-forsale as described in policy note d ii.
s Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Thefollowing differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 62 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 01 11 12 27 28 48 49 88 The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
t Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Management regard the Groups services as comprising one business segment being provision of investment management services and that its operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis.
u Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Theestimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment are described in note 31. v Adopted IFRS not yet applied The Group has adopted all IFRSs endorsed by the EU.
Newly adopted IFRSs in the year have had no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Company In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically relate to the Company: w Investment in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
x Financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee or that guarantee expires for any reason.
2 Revenue Management fees are accrued throughout the period in line with fluctuations in the levels of assets under management.
Periodic performance fees are recognised only if performance hurdles have been achieved in a period.
TheGroup is not considered to be reliant on any single source of revenue.
During the year, four of the Groups funds provided between 5.0% and 7.5% of total revenue through management fees.
One of the Groups funds provided 11.0% of total revenue in the year when considering management fees and performance fees on a combined basis.

The reduction in the corporation tax rate was not substantively enacted by 30 June 2010.
Asaresult, the Groups deferred tax balances have been calculated using a rate of 28%.
A change to 27% would not materially impact these financial statements.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent of 160.0m FY2008 09: 115.0m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with an adjustment to the weighted average number of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
There is no difference between the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

The Ashmore First Discretionary Share Option Scheme Option Scheme The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000.
Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of 10 years and vest after 5years from date of grant.
Thefair value of options at each reporting year end has been accounted for on an equity-settled basis.
No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme.
The Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan Omnibus Plan The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, market value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options and or nil cost options to employees.
Theplan will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares.
These elements can be used singly or in combination.
The Approved Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of market value options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding 30,000 per employee.
TheCSOP qualifies as a UK tax-approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC.
Todate, there have been no awards made under the CSOP.

Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 69 Notes to the financial statements continued Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend when approved by the shareholders.
On 13 September 2010 the Board proposed a final dividend of 9.34p per share for the year ended 30June 2010.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end which qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be 63.7m FY2008 09: 57.0m.

No impairment was deemed necessary.
The recoverable amounts of the business are determined based upon future forecast profitability and cash flow projections.
Thekey assumptions on which management has based its projections are the expected fund flows and growth of AuM, which determine management and performance fee income.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 70 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 01 11 12 27 28 48 49 88 The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset allocations, research and other such operational practices reflecting the commonality of approach across all fund themes.
Therefore, no further split into smaller cash-generating units is possible, and the impairment review is conducted for the Group as a whole.
The goodwill balance within the Company at the beginning and end of the year is 4.1m and relates to the acquisition of the business from ANZ in 1999.
Additional goodwill arising in the Group is in respect of the Dolomite acquisition in 2008.
There has been no gross impairment of goodwill to date.

17 Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held-for-sale Where Group companies inject seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group, then the fund is classified as being held-for-sale.
Typically, if the fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year from the original investment date it will cease to be classified as held-for-sale, and will be consolidated line by line.
In determining whether to execute the reclassification, the Group will have regard to the proximity of loss of control, and the extent to which consolidation of the fund on a line-by-line basis would be material to the presentation of the Groups financial statements.

20 Financial instrument risk management Group The Group is subject to business and strategy, investment and operational risk throughout its business as discussed in the Business review.
Specific areas of financial instrument risk include credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk.
Theeffectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Groups senior management.
TheAshmore Group risk management and control department and the Groups risk & compliance committee RCC are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment.
TheGroup has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition as a regulated business the Group is responsible for maintaining appropriate capital and performing regular calculations of capital requirements, including the development of an internal capital adequacy assessment process ICAAP, based upon the Financial Services Authoritys methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive.
An overview of the ICAAP can be found on our website at www.
Credit risk The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
TheGroups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Financial assets subject to credit risk at 30June 2010 are as follows: 2010 2009 Notes m m Cash and cash equivalents 344.4 288.4 Available-for-sale financial assets 8 39.9 4.8 Derivative financial instruments 0.8 Non-current assets held-for-sale 17 35.9 34.8 Total excluding trade and other receivables 420.2 328.8 Trade and other receivables 14 45.7 33.1 Total trade and other receivables 45.7 33.1 Total 465.9 361.9 Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Trade and other receivables at amortised cost Financial assets at amortised cost principally comprise fee debtors, which are all less than 90 days old.
Fee debtors arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.
Financial assets available-for-sale Such assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity instruments in seeded funds.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are liquid short-term deposits with banks which have credit ratings ranging from AtoA as at 30June 2010 2009: A to A.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value Such assets comprise derivative financial instruments with positive and negative fair values.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 74 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 01 11 12 27 28 48 49 88 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
Theliquidity policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 12months.

The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30June 2010, if interest rates had been 200 basis points higher or 45 basis points lower 2009: 200 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 6.6m higher 1.5m lower 2009: 4.5m higher 4.5m lower, mainly as a result of higher lower interest on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits.

Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the US$ exchange rate.
The Groups policy is to hedge this net foreign exchange exposure by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts and or options for up to two years forward.
TheGroup also sells USdollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.
At 30June 2010, if the US dollar had strengthened weakened by 10 cents against sterling with all other variables held constant, profit before tax for the year would increased decreased by 11.1m 9.7m respectively FY2008 09:15.1m 10.8m.
The Group also holds a number of seed capital investments, as shown on the balance sheet, which are denominated in Brazilian real or USdollars.
Any such seed investments give rise to foreign exchange risk.
At 30June 2010, if the Brazilian real and US dollar had, in aggregate, strengthened weakened by 1% against sterling with all other variables held constant, net assets and net revenue for the year would increased decreased by 0.6m 0.6m FY2008 09:0.3m 0.3m.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes.
The Groups direct exposure to price risk is in respect of the seed capital investments it holds on its balance sheet.
These can be either debt or equity instruments, where the Groups exposure is restricted to the carrying value of the assets or liabilities.
At30June 2010, a 5% movement in the fair value of these investments would have had a 3.3m FY2008 09: 2.0m impact on net assets.
There is also indirect price risk in connection with the Groups AuM and its associated management and performance fees.
These are diversified across a range of investment themes and not measurably correlated to any single market indices in emerging markets.
Based on the year end assets under management of US$35.3bn, and a sensible medium-term average net management fee rate of 1%, a 5% movement in AuM would have a US$17.7m impact in management fee revenues.
Performance fee revenues could be reduced in severe market conditions, however throughout Ashmores history the policy of having funds with year ends staged through the financial year has meant that in periods of steep market decline some performance fees have still been recorded.
The profitability impact is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including reduction in the variable compensation paid to employees.
Hedging activities Included within the realised and unrealised hedging losses of 4.8m recognised at 30June 2010 are: a 1.6m loss in respect of foreign exchange options covering net management fee income for the financial year ending 30June 2011: and a 3.1m loss in respect of crystallised forward foreign exchange contracts.
Ashmore Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 77 Notes to the financial statements continued Financial year ending 30 June 2011: foreign exchange options The options have been assessed as effective cash flow hedges at 30 June 2010.
Time value in relation to the options is excluded from being part of the hedging item and, as a result, a net unrealised loss arising on the options of 1.6m FY2008 09: 0.4m gain has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 30June 2010, being the movement in the time value of the options in the financial year.
The 0.6m FY2008 09: nil intrinsic loss of the options has been recognised through other comprehensive income.
Nil intrinsic value FY2008 09: nil was reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income in the year.
The cumulative fair value of the outstanding foreign exchange option collars liberty at 30 June 2010 was 1.8m 2009: nil.
This treatment will continue so long as the hedges are assessed as being highly effective.
Intrinsic value gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise.
All outstanding options mature in the year ending 30 June 2011 and hedge a proportion of the Groups revenue cash flows which occur consistently throughout the year.
