The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
aa Key assumptions The directors consider that the key assumptions applied at the balance sheet date, which may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: those assumptions used in arriving at the pension asset liability under IAS 19.
These key assumptions and their possible impact are disclosed in note 24, Pensions and other post-retirement benefits: the bad debt provision which is calculated by applying a range of percentages to debt of different ages.
These percentages also vary between different categories of debt.
Higher percentages are applied to those categories of debt which are considered to be of greater risk and also to debt of greater age.
The value of the bad debt provision is sensitive to the specific percentages applied: and the asset lives assigned to property, plant and equipment, details of which can be found in note 1 f. 99
