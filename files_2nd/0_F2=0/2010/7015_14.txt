Notes to the Accounts 1 Segmental analysis Sector analysis The Group has three main reportable segments Infrastructure Sensors, Health and Analysis and Industrial Safety, which are defined by markets rather than product type.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and marketing characteristics.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer.
These reportable segments remain unchanged from the 28 March 2009 financial statements.

Information about major customers The Group had no revenue from a single customer, which accounts for more than 2% of the Groups revenue.
2 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 375,485,642 shares in issue during the year net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares 2009: 373,831,805.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 376,513,219 shares 2009: 374,893,326, which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares of 1,027,577 2009: 1,061,521.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.
A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic earnings per share figures is as follows: Per ordinary share 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 pence pence Earnings from continuing operations 60,437 52,581 16.10 14.07 Add back amortisation of acquired intangibles after tax 2,970 4,618 0.79 1.23 Adjusted earnings 63,407 57,199 16.89 15.30 3 Non-GAAP measures The Board uses certain non-GAAP measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group.

Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Infrastructure Sensors Fire Detection 10,961 11,363 Security Sensors 15,795 15,795 Automatic Door Sensors 45,433 47,537 Elevator Safety 10,018 9,706 82,207 84,401 Health and Analysis Water 7,841 7,972 Photonics 42,755 43,889 Health Optics 32,044 30,142 Fluid Technology 6,676 7,142 89,316 89,145 Industrial Safety Bursting Disks 7,570 8,100 Safety Interlocks 5,610 5,806 Asset Monitoring 10,631 10,632 23,811 24,538 195,334 198,084 Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGUs.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at the Groups pre-tax estimated short-term discount rate to calculate their net present value.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions, which are the same for all CGUs: Discount rates: Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 86 Financial Statements 11 Goodwill continued Market share during the budget period for the financial year to March 2011: and Growth rate used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
Discount rates are based on the Groups borrowing and equity profile.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present discount rate of 9.84% 2009: 10.25%.
The discount rate of 9.84%, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC.
Market share assumptions are important because, as well as the growth rates as noted below, management assess how each units relative position to its competitors might change over the budget period.
Management expects each units position to be stable over the projected period.
Growth rate estimates of respectively 3.25%, 2.0% and 1.25% for the first, second and third year onwards into perpetuity following the budget year are based on conservative estimates keeping in view past performance growth.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Trademarks including protected technical knowledge are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between three and ten years.
Other intangibles comprise a licence and product registration costs amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between three and five years.
None of the inventory has been pledged as security.

In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historic collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

The provisions comprise the Directors best estimates of future payments: a to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties: and b on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.
These commitments cover the period from 2010 to 2028, though they predominantly fall due within five years.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group companies standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period.
Any warranties longer than 12 months are not significant and the provision represents the Directors best estimate of the Groups liability based on past experience.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.

The temporary differences at 3 April 2010 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of a change to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
At 3 April 2010 the Group had unused capital tax losses of 871,000 2009: 889,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Changes during the year in the issued ordinary share capital were as follows: Issued and fully paid 000 At 28 March 2009 37,539 Share options exercised 226 At 3 April 2010 37,765 The total consideration received in cash in respect of share options exercised amounted to 3,039,000.
At 3 April 2010 options in respect of 4,133,788 2009: 6,776,695 ordinary shares remained outstanding.
Further details of these are given in note 22 to the accounts.
At the date of these accounts, the number of ordinary shares in issue was 377,721,994, including treasury shares of 1,523,217.

Share incentive plan Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in the market by the Plans trustees at the time of the award and are held in trust until their transfer to qualifying employees, which is conditional upon completion of three years service.
The costs of providing this Plan are recognised in the Consolidated income statement over the three-year vesting period.
Share option plans The Group has issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under three share option plans, approved by shareholders in 1990, 1996 and 1999.
These share option plans provide for the grant of two categories of option, both of which are subject to performance criteria.
Section A options are exercisable after three years if the Groups earnings per share growth exceeds, for the 1990 Plan, the growth in the Retail Price Index, for the 1996 Plan, the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 2% per annum and, for the 1999 Plan, the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum.
Section B options are exercisable after five years if the Companys earnings per share growth exceeds the earnings per share of, for the 1990 and 1996 Plans, all but the top quarter of companies which were within the FTSE 100 at the date of grant of any option and for the 1999 Plan, all but the top quarter of companies which were within a peer group at the date of grant of any option.
All options lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
No further awards have been made under the Company share option plans since 3 August 2005.
Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 92 Financial Statements 22 Share-based payments continued Options in respect of 4,133,788 ordinary shares remained outstanding at 3 April 2010 under the 1999 Plan.

The options outstanding at 3 April 2010 had exercise prices from 111.0p to 163.5p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.6 years.
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 only the options awarded in 2004, 2005 and 2006 under the 1999 Plan have been recognised under IFRS 2.
The fair value of these options was calculated using the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: 2006 2005 2004 Option section A A B A B Dividend yield 4% 4% 4% 4% 4% Expected volatility 25% 25% 25% 25% 25% Expected life years 4 4 6 4 6 Risk free rate % 4.1% 4.34.9% 4.9% 3.8% 4.0% Option price p 145.67 142.25157.92 142.25 134.00 134.00 Fair value per option p 24.70 25.71-27.22 29.25 22.18 25.35 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price over the previous six years.
Performance share plan The performance share plan was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the previous share option plans from which no further grants will be made.
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Groups relative Total Shareholder Return against the FTSE 250 excluding financial companies, combined with an absolute Return on Total Invested Capital measure.
Awards which do not vest on the third anniversary of their award lapse.

Their principal activity relates to the Health and Analysis sector.
Solely goodwill arose from the acquisition of SphereOptics assembled workforce and consequently no acquired intangible assets were recognised.
Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 94 Financial Statements 23 Acquisitions continued This acquisition contributed 509,000 of revenue and 54,000 of loss after tax for the year ended 3 April 2010.
If this acquisition had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Groups reported revenue would have been 2,484,000 higher and profit after tax 24,000 lower.
Adjustments were made to the book value of the net assets of the company acquired to reflect its provisional fair value to the Group.
Acquired inventories were valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading were recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included and accounting policies were aligned with those of the Group where appropriate.
The adjustment to goodwill arising on prior year acquisitions related to an additional deferred tax liability fair value adjustment 228,000 on the acquisition of Fiberguide Industries, Inc and a revision to its estimated deferred purchase consideration 915,000.
The best estimates of the deferred purchase considerations for SphereOptics LLC and Fiberguide Industries, Inc are $2,800,000 and $1,638,000 and the minimum and maximum values payable are $nil both and $3,500,000 and $5,000,000 respectively.
The considerations for both acquisitions are based on profit before tax results and are payable June 2011 and 2012, and November 2010 respectively.

25 Financial instruments Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
Other than entering into forward foreign exchange contracts in designated cash flow hedges, policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting policies note.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and Europe, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short-term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to provide longer term funding are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 96 Financial Statements 25 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 130,699,000 2009: 141,806,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Liquidity risk The main source of long-term funding for the Group is its unsecured revolving credit facility for 165m, which is a five-year facility to February 2013, with a small syndicate of its principal bankers.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 285,000 2009: 185,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to the Sterling would have had a 204,000 2009: 210,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 3 April 2010.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar.
Group policy is for the majority of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 2,344,000 at 3 April 2010 2009: 8,100,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 1,591,000 2009: 6,980,000, and Euro, US Dollar and other currency deposits of 753,000 2009: 1,120,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 28,979,000 2009: 26,887,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 22,241,000 at 3 April 2010 2009: 86,173,000.
All bear interest at floating rates or fixed rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on LIBOR plus a small margin.
These liabilities comprise US Dollar denominated bank loans of 8,081,000 2009: 39,182,000 which bear interest with reference to the US Dollar LIBOR rates, Euro denominated bank loans of 13,843,000 2009: 46,991,000 which bear interest with reference to the EURIBOR rates and overdrafts of 317,000 mainly in Euros, which bear interest at local base rates.
Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 97 Notes to the Accounts continued 25 Financial instruments continued Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the deferred purchase consideration, other payables, provisions and borrowings due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The total of deferred purchase consideration due after one year includes 946,000 2009: 13,000 due between one and two years, with the balance of 893,000 2009: 43,000 due between two and five years.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 1,758,000 2009: 1,721,000 due between one and two years, 279,000 2009: 817,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 678,000 2009: 1,138,000 due after more than five years.
Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of long-term funding is its unsecured five-year 165 million revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2013.
Short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
UK companies have cross-guaranteed 20,684,000 2009: 21,023,000 of overdraft facilities of which 169,000 2009: 242,000 was drawn.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 3 April 2010 and 28 March 2009 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
2010 2009 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value Fair value and carrying amount of financial instruments 000 000 000 000 Trade and other receivables 98,077 98,077 103,544 103,544 Trade, other payables and provisions falling due within one year 68,470 68,470 63,379 63,379 Trade, other payables and provisions falling due after one year 6,508 6,508 3,732 3,732 Cash and cash equivalents 31,323 31,323 34,987 34,987 Floating rate borrowings 317 317 Fixed rate borrowings 21,924 21,924 86,173 86,173 Derivative financial instruments in a designated cash flow hedge 71 71 Derivative financial instruments not in a designated cash flow hedge 28 28 32,082 32,082 14,753 14,753 The fair value of the floating and fixed rate borrowings approximate to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 98 Financial Statements 25 Financial instruments continued Hedging As explained previously, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated income statement, unless hedge accounted.

In 2010, the Group commenced entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast transactions.
The fair values of the contracts are now separately disclosed and any movements recognised in equity until the hedge transaction occurs, when gains losses are recycled to finance income or finance expense.

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, mainland Europe and the UK: and foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro and US Dollar as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar currency and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro currency.
The carrying amount of the Groups Euro and US Dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 Euro 62,463 70,018 13,601 14,398 US Dollar 82,589 87,965 16,973 19,450 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 Profit 2,620 1,696 1,871 1,930 Other equity 6,951 7,245 13,706 13,616 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased significantly against the US Dollar because more of the Groups profits are earned in this currency.
26 Commitments Capital commitments Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 3 April 2010 but not provided in these accounts amounts to 740,000 2009: 1,841,000.
Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between April 2010 and November 2028 and the latter between April 2010 and November 2014.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.
Total payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: Land and buildings Other 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 Within one year 5,303 5,160 459 520 Within two to five years 10,535 12,367 675 766 After five years 3,025 4,354 18,863 21,881 1,134 1,286 Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 100 Financial Statements 27 Retirement benefits Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002 03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 2,433,000 2009: 2,388,000 and represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2008 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Mr Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2009 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
The accumulated benefit obligation ABO is an actuarial measure of the present value for service already rendered but differs from the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumptions for future salary increases.
At the balance sheet date the gross accumulated benefit obligation was 171 million.
An alternative method of valuation is a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the on-going liabilities of the scheme.
The Group estimates that this would amount to 240 million.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010 101 Notes to the Accounts continued 27 Retirement benefits continued Mortality assumptions: Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group's defined benefit schemes.
These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality rates.
The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2010 2009 2008 years years years Retiring today: Males 21.9 22.0 22.0 Females 24.7 24.9 24.8 Retiring in 20 years: Males 23.8 23.1 23.1 Females 26.6 25.9 25.9 The Halma Group Pension Plan baseline mortality assumption is derived from the SN03 tables less one year 2009 and 2008: PA92 medium cohort.
The Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan baseline mortality assumption is derived from the PA92 medium cohort tables plus one year 2009 and 2008: PA92 medium cohort tables plus one year.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decrease increase by 10.8 % Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 7.0 % Rate of salary growth Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 2.6 % Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 2.3% Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Current service cost 2,203 2,731 Interest cost 8,375 8,521 Expected return on scheme assets 6,377 7,762 4,201 3,490 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.

Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 103 Notes to the Accounts continued 27 Retirement benefits continued In conjunction with the trustees, the Group has recently conducted an asset-liability review for its defined benefit pension scheme.
The results of this review are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the scheme.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the schemes investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group will be giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of scheme assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of our defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.
The five-year history of experience adjustments was as follows.
2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of defined benefit obligations 170,901 132,379 145,992 145,601 141,580 Fair value of scheme assets 127,830 89,811 110,035 108,341 95,561 Deficit in the scheme 43,071 42,568 35,957 37,260 46,019 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount 136 273 536 52 Percentage of scheme liabilities Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount 27,648 33,696 12,327 1,321 11,271 Percentage of scheme assets 22% 37 % 11% 1% 12% The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the year ending 2 April 2011 is 8.8 million.
The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit scheme.
The Group estimates the scheme liabilities on average to fall due over 22 years.
28 Disposal of businesses In 2010 the Group disposed of part of its Asset Monitoring business for 520,000 with a profit on disposal of 407,000.
There was an additional write down on a prior year disposal of 25,000.
During 2009, the Group disposed of two operations: the assets of the South Africa-based portion of Texecom Limited and the high-power resistors business of Fortress Systems Pty Limited, Australia.
Total consideration for the disposed businesses was 2,652,000 comprising assets with a value of 1,951,000.
After costs and recycling of foreign exchange losses from reserves to the Consolidated income statement, the profit on disposal was 357,000.
Due to the nature and size of these disposed operations, they have not been separately disclosed as discontinued operations as defined by IFRS 5.
