Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 catalo Oxide Ore reserves: The decrease is due to Ore Reserves within the Area Leste being re-allocated to Mineral Resources -2.2Mt, following the development of a new pit model that is restricted within the Area Leste MGC-01 tenement boundary: Material within the Fosfertil tenement adjacent to Area Leste being excluded as the 2009 agreement with Fosfertil was not concluded -3.2Mt : A block at Boa Vista Mine was re-allocated to Mineral Resources -0.9Mt because the estimated silica grade of the final concentrate exceeded 6.25%.
2 catalo Oxide Mineral resources: The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5% Nb O cut-off.
The Mineral Resources have been split into Oxide and Fresh Rock in 2010 due to the recognition of 2 5 distinct differences in mineralogical characteristics.
The Oxides from Morro fide Padre have also been re-allocated to Mineral Deposit due to uneconomic metallurgical recoveries.
3 catalo Fresh rock Mineral resources: The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7% Nb O cut-off.
The Morro fide Padre area is included in the Fresh Rock Mineral Resources.
