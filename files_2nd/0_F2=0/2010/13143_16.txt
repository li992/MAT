Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, disposal gains and loses and other non operating items, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term and includes the benefit of tax amortisation where available on acquired goodwill and intangible assets.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Exceptional restructuring costs in 2010 relate to the restructuring of the Reed Business Information business and in 2009 relate to the exceptional restructuring programmes across Reed Elsevier.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration and, from 2010, professional and other transaction related fees and adjustments to deferred and contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs.

146 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2010 Overview Our business Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier PLC Directors report continued Disclosure of information to auditors As part of the process of approving the companys 2010 financial statements, the directors have taken steps pursuant to section 418 2 of the Companies Act 2006 to ensure that they are aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the companys auditors are aware of that information.
In that context, so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the companys auditors are unaware.
Going concern The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the combined businesses to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2010 financial statements.
In reaching this conclusion, the directors have had due regard to the combined businesses financial position as at 31 December 2010, the strong free cash flow of the combined businesses, Reed Elseviers ability to access capital markets and the principal risks facing Reed Elsevier.
A commentary on the Reed Elsevier combined businesses cash flows, financial position and liquidity for the year ended 31 December 2010 is set out in the Chief Financial Officers Report on pages 44 and 45.
This shows that, after taking account of available cash resources and committed bank facilities that back up short term borrowings, none of Reed Elseviers borrowings fall due within the next two years.
Reed Elseviers policies on liquidity, capital management and management of risks relating to interest rate, foreign exchange and credit exposures are set out on pages 48 and 49.
Further information on liquidity of the combined businesses can be found in note 18 of the combined financial statements.
The principal risks facing Reed Elsevier are set out on pages 50 to 52.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, based on current forecasts, it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Full provision is made for deferred tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits from foreign subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures.
Movements in deferred tax are charged and credited in the income statement, except when they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
