Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 23 Summary report of the Directors Principal activity and business review The principal activity of the Group is retailing and associated activities in the UK, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Republic of Ireland, India, Japan, Malaysia, Poland, Slovakia, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and the US.
The Group also provides retail banking and insurance services through its subsidiary Tesco Bank.
The summary of the Group financials is on pages 26 to 28.
Dividends The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 9.16 pence per ordinary share to be paid on 9 July 2010 to members on the Register at the close of business on 30 April 2010.
Together with the interim dividend of 3.89 pence per ordinary share paid in December 2009, the total dividend for the year will be 13.05 pence, compared with 11.96 pence for the previous year, an increase of 9.1%.
Directors Details of the current members of the Board are shown on the inside back cover.
David Reid, Lucy Neville-Rolfe, David Potts, Ken Hydon and Tim Mason retire from the Board and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting AGM.
Ken Hanna joined the Board on 1 April 2009.
Corporate governance Tesco PLC is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance.
The Board considers that Tesco PLC complied in all respects with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance for the year ended 27 February 2010 with the exception of provision A.
3.2, in respect of which the company was not in compliance for part of the year.
3.2 requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise Non-executive directors determined by the Board to be independent.
The Board recognises the importance of a balanced board with an appropriate level of independence.
Due to unexpected changes to the Board in the previous year, with the resignation of Carolyn McCall and Mervyn Davies as Non-executive Directors, the Board was not in balance at the beginning of the year.
At this stage, Ken Hannas impending appointment to the Board had already been announced, and he joined the Board with effect from 1 April 2009, at which point the Board became balanced and once again fully compliant with provision A.
A full corporate governance statement is contained in the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010.
Summary report of the Directors on remuneration Remuneration policy It is the role of the Remuneration Committee to determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Executive Directors.
Tesco has a long-standing policy of valuing talent and experience and seeks to provide incentives for delivering high, sustainable and profitable growth which leads to a strong increase in value for shareholders.
The remuneration strategy is tailored to reward the delivery of strong year-on-year earnings growth as well as sustained performance in the longer term.
Compliance In carrying out its duties, the Remuneration Committee gives full consideration to best practice.
The Committee was constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the principles outlined in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority derived from the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Remuneration Report complies with the disclosures required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
A summary of Directors emoluments and interests is set out on page 25.

Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 25 Group financials These results are for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010.
In the last full financial year, we reported a 53-week period for the UK, Republic of Ireland and the United States US and a 52-week period for the rest of the Group.
Growth rates in these results are expressed for the UK, Republic of Ireland and US to coincide with the comparable 52 weeks last year.
Statutory numbers include the adoption of IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
All other numbers are shown excluding IFRIC13, consistent with internal management reporting.
More information can be found in note 1 to the Group financial statements in the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Group sales, including VAT, increased by 6.8% to 62.5 billion.
At constant exchange rates, sales increased by 6.1% including petrol and 7.7% excluding petrol.
Underlying profit before tax rose to 3,395 million, an increase of 10.1%.
Group trading profit was 3,412 million, up 12.3% on last year and Group trading margin, at 5.9%, rose 25 basis points.
These were helped by the fact that Tesco Bank was fully consolidated in 2010 and accounted for as a joint venture for most of 2009.
Group operating profit rose by 10.7% to 3,457 million.
Group profit before tax increased 10.4% to 3,176 million.
On a statutory 52-week basis compared to 53 weeks last year, Group operating profit rose by 9.1% to 3,457 million and Group profit before tax rose by 8.9% to 3,176m.
Cash flow and balance sheet Tesco liquidity has improved significantly during the year through strong cash generation, tight control of capex and working capital improvements arising from better inventory management.
Net debt has consequently reduced by 1.7 billion to 7.9 billion.
Excluding the effects of currency fluctuations, we expect to reduce net debt to 7.5 billion by the end of the 2010 11 financial year.
The strength of our property backed balance sheet was further demonstrated with profitable market leading sale and leaseback transactions.
Group capital expenditure was 3.1 billion last year 4.7 billion.
This reduced level of spend was achieved whilst still delivering 8% growth in Group selling space.
This year we plan to invest around 3.5 billion in capital expenditure.
Excluding Tesco Bank, cash flow from operating activities totalled 5.4 billion 5.1 billion in 2009, including a 0.6 billion improvement in working capital.
Finance costs and tax Net finance costs, after net favourable IFRS adjustments of 103 million, reduced to 314 million 356 million last year on a consistent 52-week basis.
A reduction in the underlying interest charge is expected next year.
Total Group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 26.4% last year 26.7%.
We expect the tax rate in 2010 11 to be around 26%.
Dividend Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2% to 16.62p in the second half, calculated using a constant tax rate.
The Board has approved a final dividend of 9.16p per share, taking the full-year dividend to 13.05p.
This represents an increase of 9.1% on last years full-year dividend which is in line with the growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at constant exchange rates.
The final dividend will be paid on 9 July 2010 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 30 April 2010.
Property We are continuing to release value created through the long-term development of our property portfolio.
In the year we completed deals with total proceeds of 1.8bn and we expect to divest a similar amount this year.
The strong demand for these assets and the good yields achieved initial yields between 5.0% and 5.2% for stores demonstrate the strong underlying value of our property and the strength of the Tesco covenant.
Profits from property in the year were 377m.
Our property mix remains strong over 70% of our property is freehold supported by substantial new capital investment in freehold assets each year.
Our latest property assets valuation of 34.6bn reflects recent firming yields across the market and confirms that our assets are worth well in excess of their book value.
Pension Our award-winning defined-benefit career-average pension scheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, which helps Tesco recruit and retain the best people.
In the UK we have 160,000 employees in the scheme.
As at February 2010, under the IAS 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, the scheme had a deficit on a post-tax basis of 1.3bn, compared to 1.4bn at the half year.
The last actuarial valuation of the schemes assets and liabilities showed a small and manageable deficit.
Return on capital employed We have continued to invest during the recession, which has put pressure on returns in the short term but is enabling us to make good progress in all our markets.
During the financial year 2010 our post-tax return on capital employed ROCE fell from 12.8% to 12.1%.
Having raised ROCE from 10.2% in 2003 to 12.6% in 2006, we committed in April 2006 to increase ROCE a further 200 basis points to 14.6%.
We are reaffirming this commitment with confidence that with the prospect of an improving global economy and recent significant investments in acquisitions and new space making a greater contribution going forward, returns will improve in the coming few years, starting in 2010 11.
