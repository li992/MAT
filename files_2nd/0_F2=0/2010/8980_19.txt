Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2010 171 Financial Statements Mining reserves and resources Year ended 31 December 2010 Reserves and resources estimation methods Kazakhmys Copper The Republic of Kazakhstan inherited the classification system and estimation methods for minerals established by the Former Soviet Union FSU.
Updated Regulations for the Classification of Non-ferrous Metals Reserves became law in Kazakhstan in 2006.
In practice, this means that the statements of reserves and resources developed by Kazakhmys LLC and the mining plans to which they relate must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies for which adherence to the standardised national system of reserves and resources estimation is mandatory.
As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of Conditions for Estimation of Reserves are prepared by the corresponding national design institute and submitted for approval by the State.
The Conditions apply a well-defined process of classifying the specific deposit into one of three deposit categories, subject to which, the principles for exploration and classification of reserves and resources have been established.
The Conditions for Estimation of Reserves for each deposit specify the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations which may apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present difficulties.
Reserves and resources have traditionally been estimated by Kazakhmys LLC according to the FSU Classification and Estimation Methods for Reserves and Resources.
It is apparent that there is now more scope than previously for flexibility and discussion with state authorities with respect to ore reserve estimation methods.
This has been reflected in the increased use of computers and associated software by Kazakhmys LLC in maintaining records about resources and reserves at the operating mines and using databases linked to modelling software to assist in exploration and preliminary resource estimation.
IMC recognises this as an important step to achieve verifiable and internally consistent estimates.
IMC has reviewed the reserves and resources statements of Kazakhmys LLC and has restated them in accordance with the criteria required to meet JORC standards.
Guidelines on the Alignment of Russian minerals reporting standards and the CRIRSCO Template were published during 2010 as a joint initiative of the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards CRIRSCO and the Russian Federal Government Agency State Commission on Mineral Reserves.
The guidelines do not change the role of the JORC Competent Person who remains responsible for any estimate that is reported.
Mineral resources, by definition, must have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
In general, therefore, the total active balance resource is considered as the total indicated and measured resource at a mine.
At the mature Zhezkazgan mines, the quantum of commercial reserves that has been fully developed for extraction is taken as the proved reserve inclusive of loss and dilution factors.
The measured resource portion of the total active balance which corresponds to the proved reserve can be calculated and further calculations derive the indicated resource and the probable reserve.
Generally, at other Kazakhmys LLC mines, the total active balance is divided into respective categories A, B, C1 and C2.
The total of C1 plus A and B categories are assigned to measured resources and C2 category is assigned to indicated resource.
Conversion of measured resource to proved reserve and indicated resource to probable reserve is made by the application of appropriate modifying factors for loss and dilution.
Another important consideration is the level of planning and legal approval for the exploitation of a particular resource block.
At an operational mine, resources have been converted to reserves where the resource block can be exploited from existing capital development shafts, declines, haulages etc.
or where a feasibility study for the construction of new capital development has been completed.
The foregoing tabulations show new projects in addition to operating mines.
New projects are defined for the purpose of this report as the greenfield sites Aktogay, Aidarlay, Boschekul, Zhaisan, Anisimov Kluch and sites where operations have been suspended Zhilandy, Akbastau, Kosmurun.
Resources at new deposit areas at operating mines such as at Sayak have been included as part of the operating mine.
New projects with resources have to demonstrate that feasibility studies have been completed and that appropriate legal approvals have been granted before reserves can be included in the statement.
Consequently none of the current Kazakhmys new projects resources can be converted to reserves.
These estimates form the basis for the process of restatement of reserves in accordance with JORC compliant criteria.
All reserves quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution.
Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution and are inclusive of reserves.
All figures in reserves and resources are in metric tonnes and are dated 31 December 2010.
Kazakhmys Gold Following international convention, the Kazakhmys Gold resources reported in this document are in situ estimates, while the reserves make due allowance for mining recovery and dilution, based on actual operational experience in 2010 or assumptions made in feasibility studies.
Reserves are contained within the resources.
Reserves Resources Ore Loss Dilution.
2 Development projects relate to Aktogay, Bozshakol, Akbastau, Kosmurun, Aidarlay, Zhaisan, Zhilandy and Anisimov Kluch.
The Akbastau, Kosmurun and Zhilandy projects have also been classified as development projects in 2010.
Mine extensions are included within the original ore body as part of operating mines.
The total proven and probable reserves of Kazakhmys Copper have decreased from 2,728 MT in 2009 to 718 MT in 2010.
The decrease in total proven and probable reserves amounts to 2,010 MT and is largely attributable to the application of the CRIRSCO guidelines which advise that resources should not be converted to reserves in the absence of feasibility studies and appropriate legal approvals for eventual exploitation.
The most affected development projects in this regard are Aktogay and Bozshakol.
Areas of operating mines that are subject to further development works have, in accordance with the CRIRSCO guidelines, not been recognised in reserves unless there is sufficient mine planning and the appropriate legal approvals for eventual exploration.
The total measured and indicated resources of Kazakhmys Copper have increased by 2,416 MT to a total of 5,198 MT, as compared with 2,782 MT at the end of 2009.
Major additions to measured and indicated resources are attributable to updated estimates at Aktogay and Bozshakol and a reinterpretation of the Aidarlay resource under the CRIRSCO guidelines.
Inferred resources at Kazakhmys Copper decreased by 795 MT from 1,603 MT to 808 MT, mainly due to transfers to indicated resources under CRIRSCO guidelines.
The Akbastau, Kosmurun Development and Zhilandy projects have also been classified as development projects in 2010.
