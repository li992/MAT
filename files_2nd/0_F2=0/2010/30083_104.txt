The Group engaged Drivers Jonas Deloitte as independent valuation specialists to determine market value as at 31 March 2010.
Valuations of Property Determination of the market value of investment properties has been prepared on the basis defined by the RICS Valuation Standards 6th Edition The Red Book as follows: The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The valuation takes into account future cash flow from assets such as lettings, tenants profiles, future revenue streams, capital values of fixtures and fittings, plant and machinery, any environmental matters and the overall repair and condition of the property and discount rates applicable to those assets.
These assumptions are based on local market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
In arriving at their estimates of market values as at 31 March 2010, the valuers have used their market knowledge and professional judgement and have not only relied solely on historical transactional comparables.
