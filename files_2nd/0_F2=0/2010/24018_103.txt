26 Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of public listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and private equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value except as noted in d below and in note 17 in respect of debenture stocks.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Boards policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective include: risk diversification no more than 5% of the portfolio may be invested in unlisted securities, excluding private equity investments, and no single investment may be made which exceeds 10% of the value of the portfolio at the time of acquisition: currency exposure borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies: and gearing borrowings including the debentures value at market value should not normally exceed 20% of shareholders funds.
The Board meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Debenture stocks were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
All contracts and compliance with them, including the Debenture trust deeds, are agreed and monitored by the Board.
Gearing may be shortterm or long-term in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
Income earned in foreign currencies is converted to Sterling on receipt.
The Board regularly monitors the effects on net revenue of interest earned on deposits and paid on gearing.
The exchange rates applying against Sterling at 31 December, and the average rates during the year, were as follows: 2010 Average 2009 US Dollar 1.5657 1.5490 1.6149 Euro 1.16705 1.1655 1.12550 Yen 126.9821 136.1401 150.3345 Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and exchange rates applying at each Balance Sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of Sterling against each of these currencies by 10% would have had the following approximate effect on annualised income after tax and on net asset value NAV per share: 2010 2009 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 819 182 26 708 401 219 Capital Return 67,575 32,986 11,660 65,030 26,445 9,934 Total Return 68,394 33,168 11,686 65,738 26,846 10,153 NAV per share pence 11.21 5.44 1.92 10.40 4.25 1.61 2010 2009 US$ US$ Strengthening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 819 182 26 708 401 219 Capital Return 67,575 32,986 11,660 65,030 26,445 9,934 Total Return 68,394 33,168 11,686 65,738 26,846 10,153 NAV per share pence 11.21 5.44 1.92 10.40 4.25 1.61 These analyses are broadly representative of the Companys activities during the current and prior year as a whole, although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.
