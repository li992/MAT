Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Law and Accounting Standards UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued in January 2009.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends are treated as revenue for the year on an exdividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to their circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged to the Income Statement.
Expenses are charged against revenue except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are charged to the capital account in the Income Statement: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
The performance fee has been charged 100% to realised capital reserves, as the fee will have arisen wholly or predominantly by virtue of the capital performance of the investments.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Income Statement on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year, based on the marginal basis.
e Investments All investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
This is done because all investments are considered to form part of a group of financial assets which is evaluated on a fair value Murray International Trust PLC 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued basis, in accordance with the Companys documented investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of the net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and are charged 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Translation of all other foreign currency balances including foreign assets and foreign liabilities is at the middle rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as capital gain or loss to capital or revenue within the Income Statement depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.
h Derivative financial instruments Financial derivatives are measured at fair value based on an appropriate model.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.

On 5 November 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that management fees should be exempt from VAT.
HMRC has announced its intention not to appeal against this case to the UK VAT Tribunal and therefore protective claims which have been made in relation to the Company have now been processed by HMRC.
The VAT charged on the investment management fees has been refunded in stages.
An amount of 1,337,000 relating to the period 1 January 2004 to 30 September 2007 was recognised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Further amounts of 1,643,000 and 822,000 have been recognised in these financial statements which represent the VAT charged on investment management fees for the periods 1 January 1990 to 3 December 1996 and 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003, respectively.
The repayment was allocated to revenue and capital in line with the accounting policy of the Company for the periods in which the VAT was charged.
Within these financial statements we have also made an accrual of 1,613,000 in relation to the interest due by HMRC on the principal VAT repaid.
This sum has been allocated to revenue.

Since the Directors, currently, have no intention of repaying the loans early, they have been included in the accounts to 31 December 2010 at their principal amounts.
The Company currently has a fixed rate term loan facility with ING Bank N. V. which is fully drawn down and has a maturity date of 15 May 2016.
The Company currently has a loan facility with Barclays Bank, which is fully drawn down and has a maturity date of 4 June 2013.
The rates for these loans drawn down have been fixed for 5 years through a swap.
The swap is separate from the loan and under this the borrower either pays or receives the difference between LIBOR and the swap rate so that the actual rate paid is always the same.
The interest charged on the loan is at LIBOR plus the margin.
For Yen the LIBOR is reset every 6 months and the LIBOR rate under the loan and as reset under the swap should be identical to each other at every 6 month interval to preserve the fixed nature of the overall interest costs.
The Company currently has a fixed rate term loan facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, which is fully drawn down and has a maturity date of 16 February 2014.
The Company also has an additional JPY8,400,000,000 term loan facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc which expires on 14 May 2015.
Financial covenants contained within the relevant loan agreements provide, inter alia, that borrowings shall at no time exceed 40% of net assets and that the net assets must exceed 400 million.
The net assets were 967.7 million at 31 December 2010.
All of these shares were issued at a premium to net asset value, enhancing net assets per share for existing shareholders.
The issue prices ranged from 754p to 954p and raised a total of 66,773,000, net of expenses.
These expenses have been offset against the share premium account.
In accordance with Article 131 of the Companys Articles of Association, 8,344 B Ordinary shares, 14,872 B Ordinary shares, 6,728 B Ordinary shares, and 7,308 B Ordinary shares were allotted by way of capitalisation of reserves on 16 February, 14 May, 16 August and 15 November 2010 respectively.
On 30 June 2010, 11,611 and on 9 July 2010, 279,121, B Ordinary shares were converted into a like number of Ordinary shares of 25p in accordance with Article 47 of the Companys Articles of Association.
When the nominal value of the allotted and fully paid B Ordinary shares is less than 100,000 the Directors may, under the terms of Article 47 B, require the conversion of such shares into Ordinary shares.
The net asset value at the conversion dates of 30 June 2010 and 9 July 2010 were 786.5 and 813.0 pence per share, respectively.
On a winding up of the Company, any surplus assets available after payment of all debts and satisfaction of all liabilities of the Company shall be applied in repaying the Ordinary and B Ordinary shareholders the amounts paid up on such shares.
Any surplus shall be divided among the holders of Ordinary and B Ordinary shares pari passu according to the amount paid up on such shares respectively.
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Board reviews the capital structure annually.
As part of this review the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Based on recommendations of the committee the Company will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.
The Companys overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
Voting rights In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, on a show of hands, every member or duly appointed proxy present at a general meeting of the Company has one vote: and, on a poll, every member present in person or by proxy shall have 89 votes for every 25p nominal amount of Ordinary or B Ordinary shares held.

Derivatives and other financial instruments Risk management The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, loans and debentures and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, for the purpose of managing currency and market risks arising from the Companys activities.
The Manager has a dedicated investment management process, which ensures that the investment policy explained on page 23 is achieved.
Stock selection procedures are in place based on the active portfolio management and identification of stocks.
The portfolio is reviewed on a periodic basis by a Senior Investment Manager and also by the Managers Investment Committee.
The Companys Manager has an independent Investment Risk department for reviewing the investment risk parameters of all core equity, fixed income and alternative asset classes on a regular basis.
The department reports to the Managers Performance Review Committee which is chaired by the Managers Chief Investment Officer.
The departments responsibility is to review and monitor ex-ante predicted portfolio risk and style characteristics using best practice, industry standard multi-factor models.
Additionally, the Managers Compliance department continually monitors the trusts investment and borrowing powers and reports to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are i market price risk comprising interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude shortterm debtors and creditors, other than for currency disclosures.
i Market price risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: Murray International Trust PLC 55 Notes to the Financial Statements continued the level of income receivable on cash deposits: interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the values of the fixed interest rate securities.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise fixed rate, revolving, and uncommitted facilities.
The fixed rate Yen facilities are used to finance opportunities at low rates and, the revolving and uncommitted facilities to provide flexibility in the short-term.
Current bank covenant guidelines state that the total borrowings will not exceed 40 per cent of the adjusted net tangible assets of the Company.
The Company currently has two loan facilities with Barclays Bank, which are fully drawn down and have maturity dates of 4 June 2013.
The rates for these loans have been fixed for 5 years through a swap.
For JPY, the LIBOR is re-set every 6 months and the LIBOR rate under the loan and as reset under the swap should be identical to each other at every 6 month interval to preserve the fixed nature of the overall interest costs.
Details of borrowings at 31 December 2010 are shown in note 13 on page 52.
Interest risk profile The interest rate risk profile of the portfolio of financial assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Weighted average period for Weighted Non which average Fixed Floating interest rate is fixed interest rate rate rate bearing At 31 December 2010 Years % 000 000 000 Assets Sterling 6.50 5.44 25,174 10,638 160,020 US Dollar 13.97 7.59 36,329 1 218,482 Euro 14.47 4.50 11,980 112,159 Other 9.92 10.00 17,699 126 537,657 Total assets 91,182 10,765 1,028,318 Liabilities Bank loans Japanese Yen 3.53 2.09 161,642 Debenture Stock 150 Accruals 4,879 Total liabilities 161,792 4,879 56 Murray International Trust PLC Weighted average period for Weighted Non which average Fixed Floating interest rate is fixed interest rate rate rate bearing At 31 December 2009 Years % 000 000 000 Assets Sterling 5.44 7.52 25,213 27,940 122,138 US Dollar 20.63 7.50 42,791 172,292 Euro 15.47 4.50 8,708 240 131,567 Other 0.83 11.91 12,317 75 345,080 Total assets 89,029 28,255 771,077 Liabilities Bank loans Japanese Yen 2.47 2.17 136,531 Debenture Stock 150 Accruals 3,797 Total liabilities 136,681 3,797 The weighted average interest rate is based on the current yield of each asset, weighted by its market value.
The weighted average interest rate on bank loans is based on the interest rate payable, weighted by the total value of the loans.
The maturity dates of the Companys loans are shown in note 13 to the financial statements.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above tables.
All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
Maturity profile The table below shows the timing of cash outflows to settle the Companys financial liabilities at the Balance Sheet date.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower based on current parameter used by Managers Investment Risk Department on risk assessment and all other variables were held constant, the Companys: revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2010 would increase decrease by 108,000 2009 increase decrease by 283,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
These figures have been calculated based on cash positions at each year end.
equity reserves would increase decrease by 4,587,000 2009 increase decrease by 2,229,000.
This is also mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on cash balances and its fixed interest portfolio.
These figures have been calculated based on cash and fixed interest portfolio positions at each year end.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the interest rate risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
The risk parameters used will also fluctuate depending on the current market perception.
Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Balance Sheet can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
A significant proportion of the Companys borrowings, as detailed in note 13, are in foreign currency as at 31 December 2010.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to currency movements on borrowings by using forward foreign currency contracts as a hedge against potential foreign currency movements.
At 31 December 2010 the Company had a foreign currency contract, details of which are listed on page 60.
During the year a gain of 14,552,000 2009 loss of 724,000 was realised.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table details the Companys sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the major foreign currencies in which the Company has exposure based on exposure 5% of total exposure.
The sensitivity analysis includes foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.

Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed on pages 2 and 3, both act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The investments held by the Company are listed on various stock exchanges worldwide.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2010 would have increased decreased by 111,950,000 2009 increase decrease of 86,011,000 and equity reserves would have increased decreased by the same amount.
ii Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities note 13. iii Credit risk This is failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The risk is not significant, and is managed as follows: where the Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investments in quoted bonds are made across a variety of industry sectors and geographic markets so as to avoid concentrations of credit risk: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the risk of counterparty exposure due to failed trades causing a loss to the Company is mitigated by the review of failed trade reports on a monthly basis.
In addition, the custodian carries out a stock reconciliation to third party administrators records on a monthly basis to ensure discrepancies are picked up on a timely basis.
The Managers Compliance department carries out periodic reviews of the custodians operations and reports its finding to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
cash is held only with reputable banks with acceptable credit quality.
It is the Managers policy to trade only with Aand above Long Term rated and A-1 P-1 Short Term rated counterparties.

Fair value hierarchy The Company adopted the amendments to FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures effective from 1 January 2009.
These amendments require an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at 31 December 2010 as follows: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Note 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Quoted equities a 1,028,318 1,028,318 Quoted bonds b 91,182 91,182 Foreign exchange forward contracts c 3,984 3,984 Total 1,119,500 3,984 1,123,484 Murray International Trust PLC 61 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Note 000 000 000 000 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives d 1,804 1,804 Total 1,804 1,804 Net fair value 1,119,500 2,180 1,121,680 a Quoted equities The fair value of the Companys investments in quoted equities has been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
