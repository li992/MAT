Annual General Meeting At the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 19 April 2011 the following resolution will be proposed as special business.
Authority to Repurchase the Companys Ordinary Shares At the Companys Annual General Meeting held on 21 April 2010 it was resolved that the Company be authorised to purchase in the market up to 12,115,409 Ordinary shares 14.99% of its Ordinary share capital in issue at that time.
During the year to 31 December 2010 the Company bought back 1,140,000 Ordinary shares nominal value 285,000 which comprised 1.4% of the issued share capital at 1 January 2010 on the London Stock Exchange for cancellation.
Between 1 January 2011 and the date of this report, no further shares have been bought back.
The Board continues to believe that the ability of the Company to purchase its own Ordinary shares in the market will potentially benefit all shareholders of the Company.
The repurchase of Ordinary shares at a discount to the underlying net asset value NAV should enhance the NAV per Ordinary share of the remaining shares and may also enable the Company to address more effectively any imbalance between supply and demand for the Companys Ordinary shares.
Accordingly, the Directors are now recommending in Resolution 8 that this authority to purchase the Companys own Ordinary shares should be renewed and should now expire at the Companys Annual General Meeting to be held in 2012.
Authority will be sought to purchase up to 14.99% of the Companys Ordinary shares in issue at the date of the passing of the resolution the maximum permitted under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority at a price that is not less than 25p per share the nominal value of each share and must not exceed the higher of a 5% above the average closing price as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the day of purchase and b the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange.
The authority being sought, the full text of which can be found in Resolution 8 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, will last until the date of the Annual General Meeting in 2012.
The decision as to whether the Company repurchases any shares will be at the absolute discretion of the Board and will only be considered when it is in the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
It is the intention that purchases will only be made at a discount to net asset value.
