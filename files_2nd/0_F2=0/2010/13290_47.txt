CAPITAL AND RESERVES: CONTINUED Currency translation reserve The currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign operations, offset by foreign exchange differences on bank liabilities which have been accounted for directly in equity on account of them being classified as hedging items.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the valuation of forward exchange contracts which are effective hedges and mature after the year end.
These are valued on a mark-to-market basis, are accounted for directly in equity and are recycled through the Consolidated income statement when the hedged item affects the Consolidated income statement.
The forward contracts mature over the next three and a half years.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
Credit risk The Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: CONTINUED 2010 2009 The ageing of trade receivables past due, but not impaired, at the end of the year was: 000 000 Past due 0 -1 month 8,308 3,838 Past due 1 - 2 months 2,483 2,301 Past due more than 2 months 445 303 Balance at the end of the year 11,236 6,442 2010 2009 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 3,906 1,696 Changes in amounts provided 504 2,574 Amounts utilised 421 364 Balance at the end of the year 3,989 3,906 Liquidity risk The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid, which can change over time, affecting the Groups interest income.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately 140,000.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to market data.
The contracted cash flows for the financial liabilities are the same as the carrying values.
There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the Consolidated balance sheet.
Under the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7, all fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be categorised as Level 1.
Market risk As noted in the Financial review under Risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority of sales being made in these currencies but with a concentration of manufacturing in the UK, Ireland and India.
Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis The main exchange rate which may have a significant effect on the Groups results is the US Dollar.
The Group has hedged its forecasted Euro and Japanese Yen cash flows and hence there is not expected to be a significant impact on the Groups results resulting from fluctuations in these exchange rates against Sterling.
