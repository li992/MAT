The following statements have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and are likely to affect future financial statements.
Financial statements 72 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2010 4 Significant accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued The key accounting estimates were: a Goodwill impairment Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value.
Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 16 to the financial statements.
b Depreciation and carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment Calculating the depreciation charge and hence the carrying value for property, plant and equipment requires estimates to be made of the useful lives of the assets.
The estimates are based on engineering data and the groups experience of similar assets.
Details are set out in note 2 j. c Retirement benefit obligations Determining the amount of the groups retirement benefit obligations and the net costs of providing such benefits requires assumptions to be made concerning long term interest rates, inflation, salary and pension increases, investment returns and longevity of current and future pensioners.
Changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the amount of the obligations or the cost of providing such benefits.
The group makes assumptions concerning these matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Details of the assumptions made are set out in note 28 to the financial statements.
d Unbilled revenue Severn Trent Water raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its right to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the periodic regulatory price review processes.
For water and waste water customers with water meters, the amount recognised is dependent upon the volume supplied including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter read and the year end.
Meters are read on a cyclical basis and the group recognises revenue for unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the last billing to the end of the financial year.
The estimated usage is based on historical data, judgment and assumptions.
e Provision for impairment of trade receivables Provisions are made against Severn Trent Waters trade receivables based on historical experience of levels of recovery from accounts in a particular ageing category.
The actual amounts collected could differ from the estimated level of recovery which could impact operating results.
5 Segmental analysis The group has two reportable segments: Severn Trent Water and Severn Trent Services.
The key factor determining the identification of reportable segments is the regulatory environment in which the businesses operate.
Severn Trent Water is subject to economic regulation by Ofwat and operates under a licence to provide water and sewerage services within a defined geographical region in England and Wales.
Severn Trent Services is not subject to economic regulation and operates in markets in the USA, Europe and Asia.
The Severn Trent Executive Committee STEC is considered to be the groups chief operating decision maker.
The reports provided to STEC include segmental information prepared on the basis described above.
Details of Severn Trent Waters operations are described on pages 12 to 17 of the Business Review and those of Severn Trent Services on pages 19 to 21.
The group has a large and diverse customer base and there is no significant reliance on any single customer.
The measure of profit or loss that is reported to STEC for the segments is profit before interest, tax and exceptional items underlying PBIT.
A segmental analysis of sales and underlying PBIT is presented below.

Financial statements 80 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2010 15 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from combining operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2010 2009 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share being: Profit loss for the period attributable to the equity holders of the company 249.2 57.8 Number of shares 2010 2009 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 236.0 234.9 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options and LTIPs 0.3 0.7 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 236.3 235.6 Adjusted earnings per share 2010 2009 Pence Pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 122.8 92.7 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 122.6 92.4 Adjusted earnings per share figures are presented for combining operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, gains losses on financial instruments and exceptional items in both 2010 and 2009.
The directors consider that the adjusted figures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted figures set out above.
The adjustments to earnings are as follows: Adjustments to earnings 2010 2009 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share 249.2 57.8 Adjustments for: Exceptional items 49.7 18.9 Current tax related to exceptional items at 28% 5.6 1.8 Gains losses on financial instruments 45.7 87.0 Deferred tax 42.2 171.5 Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 289.8 217.8 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 81 16 Goodwill 2010 2009 m m Cost and net book value At 1 April 63.3 50.2 Additions 10.3 Amounts written off 0.2 Exchange adjustments 2.8 13.1 At 31 March 70.6 63.3 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.

These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumption underlying these budgets is the revenue growth.
Assumptions are determined by management of each CGU based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Discount rate 2010 2009 2010 2009 % % % % Water Purification US 3.0 3.0 7.8 8.7 Contract Operations US 3.0 3.0 8.9 9.2 UK Laboratories 3.0 3.0 8.9 9.5 Services Italy 3.0 3.0 10.1 11.7 Apliclor 3.0 10.0 The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the CGU.
Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash flows could cause the CGUs carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
The amount by which the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded its carrying value and the amount by which the growth rate or discount rate would have to change in order to reduce the recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying value is set out below.

Discount rates are derived from yield curves based on quoted interest rates and are adjusted for credit risk.
The fair value of group borrowings disclosed at 31 March 2009 has been restated to reflect a change in methodology of estimating the fair value to include an adjustment for the pricing of the groups credit risk.
The impact of the change was to reduce the estimated fair value of borrowings at 31 March 2009 by 1,004.4 million.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Cross currency swaps are valued by reference to quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Energy swaps are valued by reference to quoted forward electricity prices at the balance sheet date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.

The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading.
i Market risk The principal market risk that the group is exposed to is fluctuations in interest rates.
Since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain 4590% of its net debt in fixed rate instruments.
The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, biannually, the difference between fixed contract and floating rate interest rates calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future debt.
Economically these act to fix debt within the group which is denominated as floating rate, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a 41.9 million credit 2009: charge of 80.5 million in the income statement.
Some of the groups debt is index-linked, that is its cost is linked to changes in the Retail Price Index RPI.
This debt provides an economic hedge for Severn Trent Waters revenues and regulatory asset values that are also RPI linked under its regulatory regime.

However, since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
The group has a significant value of foreign currency debt, primarily in yen and euros.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency debt the group enters into cross currency swaps with external parties.
The groups risk management policy is to hedge 100% of all foreign currency denominated debt.
At 31 March 2010 all foreign currency denominated debt was hedged 2009: 100%.
Monetary assets and liabilities by currency, excluding functional currency Certain of the groups subsidiaries operate in markets where the local currency is different from the functional currency of the operation.
Exchange risks relating to such operations are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The net amount of foreign currency assets and liabilities and the forward contracts that have been taken out to hedge the exchange risks on these assets and liabilities and on future committed transactions are summarised below.

ii Credit risk Operationally the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 23.
For financing purposes, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Credit risk analysis At 31 March the credit limits and amounts deposited analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Credit limit Amount deposited 2010 2009 2010 2009 Rating m m m m AAA 300.0 400.0 35.5 219.8 Double A range 450.0 525.0 89.6 112.9 Single A range 525.0 375.0 58.6 253.8 1,275.0 1,300.0 183.7 586.5 The amounts of derivative assets analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Interest rate swaps not qualifying for Cross currency swaps hedge accounting 2010 2009 2010 2009 Rating m m m m AAA Double A range 71.4 55.0 19.4 18.1 Single A range 115.9 182.1 187.3 237.1 19.4 18.1 iii Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Group Treasury manages liquidity and flexibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities and by keeping committed credit lines available.
At the balance sheet date the group had committed undrawn borrowing facilities of 191.7 million expiring between one and two years 2009: nil and 458.3 million 2009: 500 million expiring between two and five years.
Financial statements 92 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2010 21 Financial instruments continued f Financial risk factors continued Financial liabilities analysed by maturity date The following tables detail the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative net financial liabilities.
The information presented is based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay and represents the undiscounted cash flow including principal and interest.
The principal is revalued at fixed intervals and is linked to movements in the retail price index.
Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal.
The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at maturity.
The calculations above are based on forward inflation rates at the balance sheet date.
When the group entered into a 200 million facility it gave certain representations which have subsequently been discovered to be inaccurate.
As a result, at 31 March 2010 there was an event of default on this facility and the outstanding amount of 200 million has been classified as current liabilities.
This technical default was in the process of being remedied on 27 May 2010.
The following tables detail the groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The tables are based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the forward curves existing at the balance sheet date.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
i Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally Japanese yen and euro.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges was as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m US dollar 27.0 27.0 7.7 9.9 Euro 548.0 550.0 90.2 108.9 Yen 161.0 205.9 66.9 85.7 Czech krona 47.2 65.7 22.5 25.6 Other 11.4 7.0 783.2 860.0 187.3 237.1 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 95 21 Financial instruments continued g Hedge accounting continued ii Cash flow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swap contracts under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the future cash flow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
The group also entered into a number of interest rate swap contracts with start dates set at annual intervals throughout the regulatory period.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt which is highly probable to be issued over the AMP5 period to fund Severn Trent Waters capital programme and have been accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The interest rate swaps settle net on a biannual basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six months LIBOR.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash flow hedges are summarised below: Average contract Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Period to maturity % % m m m m Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 4.74 106.0 3.3 2 to 5 years 5 to 10 years 10 to 20 years 5.07 5.18 493.0 40.5 9.5 6.3 More than 20 years 493.0 146.5 9.5 9.6 The group has entered into a series of energy swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and market prices of electricity at six-monthly intervals between 2013 and 2024.

Fair value losses amounting to 3.5 million relating to these swaps that had been taken directly to equity will be transferred to the income statement on a straight line basis over the remaining lives of the swaps.
Any future changes in the fair values of the swaps will be recorded in the income statement.

Prepayments and accrued income include 26.2 million 2009: 24.2 million in respect of amounts due from customers for contract work and 43.0 million 2009: 44.2 million which is recoverable after more than one year.
Credit control policies and procedures are determined at the individual business unit level.
By far the most significant business unit of the group is Severn Trent Water Limited, which represents 81% of group turnover and 62% of trade receivables.
Severn Trent Water has a statutory obligation to provide water and sewerage services to customers within its region.
Therefore there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to its trade receivables and the credit quality of its customer base reflects the wealth and prosperity of all of the commercial businesses and domestic households within its region.
None of the other business units are individually significant to the group.
