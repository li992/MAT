SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Group is organised into three main businesses: Carbon Services focuses on the developing carbon economy, including delivery into the CERT and CESP markets along with the opportunities arising in the international carbon markets: Heating and Renewables Services provides domestic heating and renewable energy solutions to Social Landlords, fuel poverty programmes and private householders: and Managed Services provision of outsourced end-to-end solutions to local and central Government and other commercial organisations.
Eliminations represent the elimination of inter-segment sales.
Transfer pricing between business segments is set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Revenue, costs, assets and liabilities have been allocated between segments firstly on those items specific to the segment: with any remaining items being allocated using a reasonable basis such as revenue.
The Directors have determined that the operating segments are based on the information contained in reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used to make strategic decisions.
The Board of Directors assesses the performance of the operating segments based on EBITA.
Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the cash position for the Group.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS During the years ended 31 May 2010 and 31 May 2009, the Group had four share-based payment arrangements which are summarised below, further details of the plans are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 32 to 37. i IPO Key Management Plan IPO KMP The IPO KMP provided for the grant of nil cost options.
The awards were granted to certain Partners on 31 May 2007 and were conditional on successful admission of the Companys shares to the London Stock Exchange.
The awards vested 50% on the first anniversary of admission and 50% on the second anniversary of admission to the London Stock Exchange.
ii Management Incentive Plan MIP The MIP provides for the grant of nil cost options.
The awards were granted to certain Partners on 13 October 2009 and 2 February 2010 2009: 14 October 2008.
The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the level of increase in adjusted diluted eps over the vesting period, and upon the TSR performance of the Group compared to the FTSE mid 250 index excluding Investment Trusts, over the vesting period.
iii Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP provided for the grant of free shares to all eligible Partners.
The initial awards were granted to all Partners on 31 October 2008.
The vesting period over these awards is one year for UK based Partners and three years for non-UK based Partners.
Further awards were granted to all Partners on 30 October 2009, funded by EPT waived dividends.
These awards vested on date of grant for UK Partners and over three years for non-UK based Partners.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued iv Executive Plan EP The EP allows for the grant of free shares to new Executive Directors on joining the Group, to ensure that their personal long-term interests are aligned to those of other external shareholders.
The awards were granted on 2 February 2010.
The awards vest 50% on the first anniversary of the award and 50% on the second anniversary of the award.

The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for all schemes other than the MIP, which has been calculated by applying a Monte Carlo pricing model.
As all share options have been granted at nil cost, the assumptions used in the models that impact on valuation are as follows: Share price Price at date of grant Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historical dividend yield Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
The Group recognised total expenses of 4,727,000 2009: 2,055,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
EPT-FUNDED CHARGES Year ended Year ended 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 EPT-funded SIP 4,230 1,559 The Group operates a SIP under which qualifying Partners may receive free shares.
EPT waived its interim and final dividends paid during the year ended 31 May 2010 amounting to 3.3m 2009: 2.8m.
These funds have been used to finance awards under the SIP.
This funding was utilised by the SIP trustee in the year to acquire a number of shares in the Company to be held in order to meet the future commitment of the SIP.
Further details of the share purchases are set out in note 26.
Eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 61 6.
EPT-FUNDED CHARGES continued There is no commitment under the SIP to make any awards to Partners in excess of those funded to date by EPT.
Because this expense has been fully funded by EPT, there is no material net impact on the Groups reserves over the contractual life of the plan, cash or net assets against that which would have occurred had EPT not waived its dividends.
Accordingly, the associated share-based payment charge incurred by the Company has been separately disclosed on the face of the income statement and excluded from EBITA.
The increase in the current year charge reflects both the higher level of dividend waived by the EPT and the removal of the previously included forfeiture provision in the SIP which means that the awards impacted by the change vest immediately and the charge is required to be taken in full.
EXCEPTIONAL COSTS Year ended Year ended 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Share-based payments 345 Share-based payments comprise the IFRS2 charge arising in respect of the fair value of share options granted to certain key management under the IPO Key Management Plan by EPT.
These awards were made solely in relation to successful admission of the Companys shares to the London Stock Exchange.
There was no cash cost to the Group in respect of the IFRS2 charge for these share-based payments and a credit of equal quantum was made to reserves resulting in unchanged net assets before recognising a deferred tax asset of Nil 2009: 325,000 in the balance sheet, being the benefit of a statutory corporation tax deduction under Schedule 23 Finance Act 2003 in respect of the share options when they are exercised.

TAX EXPENSE continued b Reconciliation of Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the year relating to continuing operations as a proportion of profit before tax is 28.6% 2009: 28.5%.
This compares with the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 28.0% 2009: 28.0% as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Profit before tax 41,471 37,728 At United Kingdom tax rate of 28.0% 11,612 10,564 Adjustment in respect of previous years 16 246 Expenditure not allowable for tax purposes 161 98 Deferred tax not provided 75 342 Tax on profit for the year 11,864 10,758 c Deferred Tax The deferred tax assets liabilities included in the balance sheet are as follows: ShareDecelerated Other based capital Intangible temporary payments allowances assets Losses differences Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 June 2008 429 1,683 3,953 15,274 20 13,453 Transfer from provisions 95 95 Charged credited in the income statement 303 756 2,048 7,923 18 5,440 Acquired in a business combination 1 1 At 31 May 2009 126 2,440 1,905 7,351 97 8,109 Charged credited in the income statement 162 643 1,294 7,193 120 6,260 Acquired in a business combination note 28 36 36 At 31 May 2010 288 1,833 611 158 217 1,885 Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset as there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The Group has the following unprovided deferred tax assets: 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Losses 1,259 1,047 These deferred tax assets have not been recognised due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient taxable profits in the companies in which they arise.
d Effect of Future Tax Changes Subsequent to the year end the Government announced changes to future corporation tax rates.
Given these tax rates were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date the financial statements have been prepared on the current rates, not allowing for the future rate changes announced.
If the rates had been used then this would have decreased the tax expense in the income statement by 67,000.

DIVIDENDS Year ended Year ended 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 31 May 2009 2.40p per share 2008: 2.00p per share 3,811 3,142 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 May 2010 1.21p per share 2009: 1.10p per share 1,910 1,742 5,721 4,884 The Directors have proposed a final dividend for the year ended 31 May 2010 of 2.64p per share amounting to 6.6m 2009: 2.40p per share amounting to 6.1m, which is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
This final dividend has not been included as a liability in the financial statements as at 31 May 2010.
EPT waived its right to the interim and final dividends relating to the year ended 31 May 2009, reducing the charge to equity by 3.2m and also the right to the interim dividend relating to the year ended 31 May 2010 reducing the charge to equity by 1.1m.
The funds waived were used to fund the SIP note 6.

These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
An operating segment level summary of goodwill allocation is presented below: 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Carbon Services 19,295 18,920 Heating and Renewables Services 40,799 40,191 60,094 59,111 The following CGUs include goodwill with a carrying value in excess of 5m: 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Eagaheat 23,124 23,124 Horrocks Group plc 7,776 7,776 RG Francis Limited 6,963 6,963 Eaga NI Limited HEAT 6,409 6,409 Other CGUs 15,822 14,839 60,094 59,111 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The Group management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets for the year to 31 May 2011 approved by the Board and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2-3% excluding inflation.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 9.1% 2009: 12.2% which is calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 6.5% 2009: 8.8% post-tax.
The Directors consider that the assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts are consistent with the historical performance of each CGU and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and market forecasts.
It is believed that any reasonably forseeable movement on assumptions will not lead to an impairment and therefore sensitivity analysis has not been presented.
As at 31 May 2010 the Directors are satisfied that the values in use exceed their carrying value.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of customers.
5.3m 2009: 21.6m is due from DECC, the Groups largest customer.
2.6m 2009: 3.7m is due from DSHS Limited in relation to the Digital Switchover Help Scheme.
There are no other customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables is stated after a provision for impairment of receivables has been made.
The provision is made by management based upon their assessment of the current economic environment and previous trading history with the counterparty.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise: cash, bank loans, finance leases and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
All financial instruments other than derivatives are stated at amortised cost.
Risk Management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the following types of financial risk on the financial performance of the Group by monitoring levels of borrowings and the related finance costs.
Capital Risk The Groups primary objectives in managing its capital are to safeguard the business as a going concern: to maintain financial flexibility to undertake its investment plans: and to optimise capital structure in order to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group monitors its ratio of net debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to total finance expense, to ensure adequate headroom is maintained against banking covenants of 2.5 times not more than and 3.0 times not less than respectively.
Credit Risk The Groups credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables on contracts.
A large proportion of the Groups customers are predominately energy supply companies, public sector and Government organisations and as such the Directors consider that the risk of default is lower than average because of the nature of these customer groupings.
Liquidity Risk The Group actively manages its exposure to liquidity risk and ensures maximum flexibility in meeting changing business needs.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities to provide liquidity back-up for the foreseeable future.
This is supplied by the bank facility in place.
The undrawn committed facilities and maturity profiles available to the Group at the balance sheet date are as follows: 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Within one year 5,000 5,000 In two to five years 60,000 60,000 65,000 65,000 Eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 75 29.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign Currency Risk The Group has operations in Canada, India and the Republic of Ireland which are affected by foreign exchange movements, and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from the purchase of certain items of inventory denominated in foreign currencies.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are as follows: 31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Monetary assets Canadian dollar 1,528 1,861 Euro 1,404 1,679 Indian rupee 274 277 Monetary liabilities Canadian dollar 997 1,721 Euro 2,308 317 Indian rupee 140 107 The table below shows the impact of the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change of 10% increase in Pounds Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies, with all other variables remaining constant, on the Groups profit before tax and net assets.
31 May 31 May 2010 2009 000 000 Increase in :CAD$ of 10% Effect on profit before tax 61 124 Effect on equity 468 354 Increase in : of 10% Effect on profit before tax 136 76 Effect on equity 136 0 Increase in :INR of 10% Effect on profit before tax 19 7 Effect on equity 109 6 Interest Rate Risk The Group has both interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Interest-bearing assets include only cash balances and current asset investments, which earn interest at a floating rate of interest linked to the UK Bank Base Rate.
The Group maintains its debt at a floating rate of interest due to the low gearing of the Group other than the hire purchase obligations and redeemable preference shares that are held at a fixed rate of interest.
Interest rate risk is not considered significant as the Group is net cash positive and accordingly a sensitivity analysis is not presented.
