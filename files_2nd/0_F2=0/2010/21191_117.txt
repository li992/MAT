Target setting ABP target setting The financial targets which underpinned the ABP accounting for 50% of annual bonus in 2010 were derived from Avivas return, growth and capital efficiency capital generation goals.
Employee and customer targets each accounting for up to 10% of annual bonus are set taking into account performance to date and aspirations for the future.
The employee targets on leadership and engagement are derived from the Groups employee promise survey in which all business units participate and which over 36,907 staff completed in 2010.
This survey is delivered through an independent third party who is able to provide extensive external benchmark data.
The Companys aspiration is to reach the upper quartile positions compared to the relevant global and national norms on leadership and engagement over time.
In 2010, all businesses measured customer advocacy using a consistent robust methodology undertaken by an independent global research agency.
All business units now have customer advocacy targets in place for 2011.
The Companys aspiration is to reach the upper quartile in the relevant local market benchmark.
Internal assurance that the outcomes on employee and customer targets were accurately calculated and reported was provided to the committee by Group Audit.

Carbon emissions targets are also included as part of the EDs role profile.
The Groups performance against its financial, employee and customer KPIs in 2010, as they affected the bonus of the Group Chief Executive, is shown in Table 8.

However, the combination of financial and non-financial measures is central to the structure of the ABP.
The committee wants to ensure a balanced focus on both short-term financial performance and on the objective non-financial measures that are leading indicators of future financial success.
This balance is, in the committees view, reflective of good practice in incentive design and is consistent with the FSAs guidance on creating incentive schemes that have a focus on long-term sustainable performance and considerate of the risk environment.
Aviva appropriately incentivises and rewards employees for achieving stated business goals in a manner that is consistent with our approach to sound and effective risk management.
As described above, the committee took the view that it was important to maintain the integrity of the financial targets for the EDs, and so these were not adjusted during the year.
In the same way, the committee believes that it is appropriate to pay bonuses based on pre-agreed rigorous targets when these have been met.
To align with the business priorities for 2011, the financial measures at Group level for 2011 are IFRS Operating Profit, Net Operating Capital Generation, Internal Rate of Return and Total Sales which are not set a stretch target in line with relevant risk considerations.
LTIP Target Setting The LTIP vests subject to the degree of achievement of two equally weighted performance measures, chosen to reflect shareholders long-term interest, in absolute ROCE and relative TSR performance.
ROCE targets ROCE targets determine the vesting of 50% of any LTIP award and are set annually within the context of the Companys three-year business plan.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three-year period against a target return.
The Companys external auditor provides a formal opinion on the ROCE vesting calculation.
The 2010 LTIP award ROCE targets are set out in Table 9 below: Table 9: 2010 LTIP ROCE Targets ROCE over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of ROCE targets Less than 31.5% 0% 31.5% 15% Between 31.5% and 37.5% Pro rata between 15% and 50% on a straight line basis 37.5% and above 50% 126 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 TSR Targets Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of any LTIP award.
The comparator group for the assessment of relative TSR performance at the time of the 2010 grant comprised Aegon, Allianz, Axa, Fortis, Generali, ING, Legal and General, Lloyds Banking Group, Prudential, Resolution Limited, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal and Sun Alliance, Standard Life and Zurich.
Friends Provident had been delisted by the time the 2010 grant was made and so was not included in the comparator group.
Resolution Limited was added to the comparator group for the 2010 grant.
TSR vesting operates as set out in Table 10 below: Table 10: TSR vesting schedule for the 2010 award TSR position over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of TSR targets Below median 0% Median 15% Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 15% and 50% on a straight line basis Upper quintile and above 50% The same targets will apply for the 2011 LTIP awards, except ROCE will be measured on an Operating IFRS basis.
The comparator group will remain unchanged.
The committee has agreed a shortlist of companies that would be considered for inclusion in the comparator group, subject to final review, should any member of the group be delisted.
2011 LTIP and future awards will vest at 20% for threshold performance down from 30%.
Details of subsisting LTIP awards are provided on page 128 and Table 11 below shows the vesting projections non-audited of those awards as at 31 December 2010.
Table 11: Projections of vesting of subsisting LTIP awards LTIP award 31 December 2010 vesting projection % of award Aviva LTIP 2010 50% Aviva LTIP 2009 79.6% Aviva LTIP 2008 72.3% Details of the assumptions used in valuing the LTIP for accounting purposes can be found on page 242 of this report.
The vesting assumption made in respect of the 2011 award for accounting purposes is 50%.
Since the LTIP has performance conditions attached to it, one potential outcome is that neither performance condition is met and the whole of the LTIP lapses.
Table 12 below has been drawn up to assist in understanding the potential value of the LTIP awards made to EDs in 2010 should the performance conditions be met in part or in whole.

No share price growth is assumed: Expected value, based on the vesting assumption made for accounting purposes, assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at a combined rate of 50% of the total award.
Share price growth of 5% per annum is assumed over the three-year performance period: Maximum vesting assumes both TSR and ROCE elements vest in full, producing a 100% vesting.
Share price growth of 10% per annum is assumed over the three-year performance period.
At the end of the performance period for the 2007 LTIP grant, which vested in 2010, the Company was ranked ninth out of the 16 companies in the TSR comparator group 0% vesting and ROCE was 39.0% 50% vesting of the whole award.
The total vesting was therefore 50%.
The 50% of the award which did not vest lapsed.
The LTIP vesting history is set out in Table 13 below.
Prior to the 2005 award, vesting history is based on an earlier LTIP plan, and the last award made under this plan was in 2004.

As outlined earlier in this report, the awards that will vest from the 2011 LTIP grants onwards will attract dividends, which is aligned to current market practice.
2008-2010 LTIP and OATTV Plan: Performance outcome for group chief executive The 2008 Annual Report disclosed the face value of the LTIP and OATTV Plan awards granted to all EDs.
The face value of the LTIP and OATTV awards granted to the group chief executive were 1,540,000 and 568,891 respectively.
The total actual value of the awards that will vest is 719,689, based on the performance condition outcome and assuming a share price of 393p which was the closing middle market price of an ordinary share of the Company on 31 December 2010.
Performance graph Table 14 below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past five years with the TSR of the FTSE 100 Return Index.
This index has been chosen because it is a recognised equity market index, of which Aviva is a member.
The companies which comprise the current LTIP comparator group for TSR purposes were chosen on the basis of product and geographic match to Aviva and are listed above.
The TSR graph for the comparator group has been plotted using the 20 companies including Aviva in the comparator group for pre-2005 grants, the 15 companies including Aviva in the comparator group for 200507 grants, the 16 companies including Aviva in the comparator group for the 2008 grant, and the 15 companies including Aviva in the comparator group for the 2009 and 2010 grants.
