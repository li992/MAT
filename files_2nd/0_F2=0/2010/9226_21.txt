In April 2010, the Group announced that it had reached a settlement with HMRC which covered substantially all outstanding items in respect of tax years to 31 December 2007.
The settlement has resulted in the recognition within the tax charge of a 261.9 million tax credit in relation to prior years.
The settlement included 46.2 million relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
The asset primarily reflected the recognition of tax losses available for offset in future periods.
The settlement resulted in a cash repayment of 80.0 million of corporation tax by HMRC, which is offset by current year payments of 28.1 million.
There was also interest income of 20.0 million in respect of an interest rebate following the HMRC tax settlement.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary differences may be deducted.
There are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures.
The Chancellor, in the Budget on 22 June 2010, announced reductions in the main rate of corporation tax and rates of capital allowances.
The standard rate of UK Corporation Tax will be reduced from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011, and there will be progressive annual reductions of a further 1% until a rate of 24% is reached with effect from 1 April 2014.
The Finance Act No 2 2010 received Royal Assent on 27 July 2010, with the first of the rate reductions being substantively enacted from 21 July 2010.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 27%.
Whilst detailed calculations have not been prepared at this stage, it is estimated that the impact of the remaining annual corporation tax rate reductions would be to reduce the value of the groups deferred tax liabilities at the balance sheet date by approximately 13.0 million, and to reduce the value of the groups deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date by approximately 12.0 million.

Goodwill and intangible assets included in continuing operations Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability arising on statutory licence acquisitions.
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences.
The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons: Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets: there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services: and existing law acts to restrict entry.
Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost.
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
The customer relationship relates to the Groups acquisition of its former partner in the Nordic region.
The existing arrangement constituted an intangible right, which was valued at the acquisition date.
Having considered the Groups long term business plans for the Nordics, the Group concluded that the relationship had an indefinite life as there was no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset was expected to generate net cash inflows.
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 74 16 Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets The Group tests annually for impairment and at each reporting date if there are indications that goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired, by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill allocated to that group would be regarded as not impaired.
Goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2010 2009 m m Goodwill UK Retail 35.4 35.4 Other European Retail 13.1 13.2 48.5 48.6 No impairments were identified in 2010.
Licences Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets.
Each CGU represents the lowest level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes which in the majority of instances is an individual shop.
The carrying value of licences at 31 December 2010 was 496.1 million 2009: 507.2 million allocated as 322.9 million to UK Retail 2009: 326.7 million and 173.2 million to Other European Retail 2009: 180.5 million.
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These are based on budgets approved by management for the next three years extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate 2009: 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate applied.
The estimated amounts staked and gross win margin are based upon historic experience, managements best estimate of future trends and performance taking account of industry sources.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 11.0% 2009: 10.5%.
The recoverable amounts of certain individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 2010 and accordingly an impairment loss of 8.5 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: 3.2 million within the non-trading Depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets line item, allocated as 3.4 million to UK Retail and 5.1 million to Other European Retail.
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate.
Change in the cash flow projections or the discount rate would trigger a further impairment loss.
For example, an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would have resulted in a further impairment loss of approximately 0.5 million for UK Retail and 5.9 million for Other European Retail, or a reduction in projected cashflows of 5% would have resulted in a further impairment loss of approximately 0.9 million for UK Retail and 7.5 million for Other European Retail.
Customer relationships Customer relationships of 40.5 million 2009: 40.5 million have been allocated to a CGU within the Digital operating segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is considerably in excess of the carrying amount of the customer relationships and accordingly no impairment charge was required.

The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Groups treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Groups financial risk and to generate the desired effective currency and interest rate profile.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had no such derivatives.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other than betting and gaming transactions.
The Groups exposure to ante post betting and gaming transactions is not significant.
The Group has a 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme that it uses to increase the flexibility of funding with regards to source, cost, size and maturity.
At 31 December 2010, one public Eurobond issue remained under this programme, being the remainder of the 250 million 7.125% bond, maturing July 2012.
During the year the Group repurchased 118.6 million of the 7.125% Sterling bond due 2012.
At 31 December 2010, the remaining amount under this bond was 131.0 million.
Funds raised via the EMTN programme have been used to repay bank debt.
In addition, in March 2010, the Group issued a 225 million 7.625% Sterling bond due 2017 which was fully subscribed, with issue costs of 3.9 million.
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups policy for the year ended 31 December 2010 was to maintain a minimum of 25% 2009: 25% of net debt at fixed interest rates to reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short-term interest rates.
At 31 December 2010, 352.6 million or 69.2% 2009: 457.3 million or 63.9% of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re-priced at intervals of less than six months.
Interest on financial instruments at fixed rates is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
Profit before tax Equity 2010 2009 2010 2009 Effect on: m m m m 100 basis points increase 0.8 1.6 0.3 200 basis points increase 1.7 3.3 0.7 100 basis points decrease 0.7 1.6 0.3 200 basis points decrease 1.4 3.0 0.7 The sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities, subject to interest at floating rates, held by the Group at the year end.
Foreign currency risk The Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises and has foreign exchange exposure to the Euro, arising from foreign currency assets.
The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is monitored and reviewed regularly.
Until 30 June 2009, the Group sought to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure arising from the translation of foreign currency assets through Euro drawings under its committed facilities.
The Group ceased formal net investment hedging on 30 June 2009.
The total carrying value of the Groups foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2010 was nil 2009: 17.6 million, of which nil 2009: 16.4 million was swapped into sterling.
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 81 Financial statements Statutory reports and financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Exchange rate sensitivity The impact of 10% and 20% movements in the exchange rates between sterling and the Euro is shown below: Profit before tax Equity 2010 2009 2010 2009 Effect on: m m m m Euro 10% increase in the exchange rate 0.1 0.3 7.8 9.8 20% increase in the exchange rate 0.2 0.5 14.2 18.0 10% decrease in the exchange rate 0.1 0.3 9.5 12.0 20% decrease in the exchange rate 0.3 0.7 21.4 27.0 The impact on equity relates primarily to unhedged foreign exchange exposure arising on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
These sensitivities have been calculated before adjusting for tax and have been estimated by applying the percentage movement to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities denominated in Euros at the year end.
Credit risk The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an individual basis.
The Groups High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes.
The Group manages this activity and the associated risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed.
Of the 3.4 million 2009: 13.7 million trade receivables balance, 2.8 million 2009: 12.6 million relates to the Groups Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and a loan to a joint venture, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group.
This risk is partly mitigated by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees.
For further detail of these guarantees refer to note 26.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The Groups policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2010, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 718.6 million 2009: 428.1 million.
Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 2.5 years 2009: 2.6 years.
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 82 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The total gross contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, including interest payments, fall due as follows: On demand or within 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Total 2010 m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 136.1 158.4 100.5 259.3 654.3 Other financial liabilities 1.7 1.0 3.8 21.3 27.8 Trade and other payables 134.4 134.4 Total 272.2 159.4 104.3 280.6 816.5 On demand or within 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Total 2009 m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 51.5 343.7 389.1 784.3 Derivatives 8.7 6.9 1.3 16.9 Other financial liabilities 0.9 1.3 3.3 21.4 26.9 Trade and other payables 126.9 126.9 Total 188.0 351.9 393.7 21.4 955.0 The total gross contractual undiscounted cash inflows in relation to derivative financial instrument assets used to hedge the risks associated with interest bearing loans and borrowings are nil 2009: 1.4 million within one year and nil 2009: nil within one to two years.
Hedging activities Hedging of net investments in foreign operations The Group ceased to designate its committed Euro borrowings as a partial hedge of the net investments in its European subsidiaries from 30 June 2009.
Pre-tax losses of nil 2009: 10.4 million post-tax losses of nil 2009: 7.5 million arising on the translation of these borrowings have been deferred in reserves during the year.
Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings by swapping borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group.
Contracts with nominal values of nil 2009: 16.2 million have fixed interest receipts and floating interest payments based on LIBOR.
The fair value of the swaps at 31 December 2010 is nil 2009: asset of 0.4 million.
Cash ow hedges The Group previously used interest rate swaps to manage its cash flow exposure.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had contracts for interest rate swaps with nominal values of 199.0 million maturing between January 2011 and January 2012.
The fair value at 31 December 2009 was a liability of 9.2 million which was deferred in equity in retained earnings.
During the year the Group terminated these interest rate swaps, as the underlying interest cash flows were no longer expected to occur.
As a result, 9.1 million of losses deferred to equity have been reclassified to the consolidated income statement as a non-trading finance cost, and 0.5 million remains deferred in equity until the forecast cash flows occur in the period to August 2011.
There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement arising from cash flow hedges.
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The Group continued to hold cross currency swaps until their maturity in July 2009.
These swaps did not qualify as net investment hedges under IAS 39 but were economic hedges of the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
The fair value of the Groups foreign exchange swaps at 31 December 2010 was a liability of nil 2009: 0.1 million.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit rating that enables the Group to raise funds at an economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure net debt and equity see note 27 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for further details and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The target range is less than 3.0 2009: less than 3.0 times net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The ratio at 31 December 2010 was 1.9 2.0 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers and at 31 December 2009 was 2.5 3.3 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers.

Financial guarantee contracts, included within other non-current financial liabilities, are classified as level 3 financial instruments, as their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Further information about financial guarantee contracts, including sensitivities, and a reconciliation of changes in fair value in the year, is included below.
Other current financial liabilities are deferred revenues associated with the fair value of reward points issued.
Included in trade and other payables are 6.0 million of antepost liabilities 2009: 4.6 million : both are classified as level 3 financial instruments as their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
No financial instruments are classified as level 1, for which fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
During the year ended 31 December 2010, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements.
Financial guarantee contracts The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.
The Group received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The guarantees expire between 2011 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is 901.2 million 31 December 2009: 933.0 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 505.9 million 31 December 2009: 517.2 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 395.3 million 31 December 2009: 415.8 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The undiscounted maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2010 is 385.9 million 31 December 2009: 407.7 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 193.4 million 31 December 2009: 201.0 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 192.5 million 31 December 2009: 206.7 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
At 31 December 2010 the Group has recognised a financial liability of 8.1 million 31 December 2009: 9.3 million in respect of these guarantees.
Fair value of guarantees liability 2010 2009 m m At 1 January 9.3 9.0 Change in fair value attributable to hotels default risk 0.6 Change in fair value attributable to time lapse 1.2 0.3 At 31 December 8.1 9.3 The change in the year in the fair value of the financial guarantees liability has been recognised in the consolidated income statement and classified in discontinued operations.
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity at 31 December 2010 2009: nil.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate.
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 1.5 million.

Dened benefit plans The Groups only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK employees.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Although the Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, professional advisers are appointed to assist the trustees in running it.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007, with the next valuation as at 30 June 2010 currently in process.
The latest actuarial valuation was updated to 31 December 2010 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19.
In July 2010, the Government announced that in future statutory indexation for pensions would be linked to the Consumer Prices Index CPI rather than the, historically, higher Retail Prices Index.
On the basis of legal advice, the Group has assessed that this change will act to reduce the Groups pension liabilities.
To reflect this, in 2010 the Group has recognised an actuarial gain of 8.6 million outside profit and loss through other comprehensive income.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Present value of funded obligations 228.6 227.4 Fair value of plan assets 263.1 242.4 Net asset 34.5 15.0 Amounts in the balance sheet Asset 34.5 15.0 Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 89 Financial statements Statutory reports and financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes continued The amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Analysis of amounts charged to staff costs continuing operations Current service cost excluding employee element 3.5 2.8 Interest on obligation 13.0 12.4 Expected return on plan assets 13.7 11.8 Total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in staff costs 2.8 3.4 The actual return on plan assets over the year was a gain of 24.5 million 2009: a gain of 25.9 million.
The amount recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2010 is a gain of 15.6 million 2009: loss of 9.4 million.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income at 31 December 2010 is a loss of 25.1 million 2009: loss of 40.7 million.

Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 90 31 Retirement benefit schemes continued The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2010 2009 Equity instruments % 42.0 41.0 Debt instruments % 58.0 59.0 100.0 100.0 Principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date expressed as weighted averages where appropriate : 2010 2009 % pa % pa Discount rate 5.5 5.8 Expected return on plan assets 5.8 6.0 Future salary growth 0% in 2011 and 0% in 2010, 2.5% in 2011 4.5% pa thereafter, and 4.6% pa thereafter, plus promotional scale plus promotional scale Price inflation 2.8 3.6 Future pension increases LPI 5% 2.8 3.5 LPI 3% 2.7 2.7 LPI 2.5% 2.1 2.3 The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes over the long term.
The sources used to determine the best estimate of long-term returns include bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
At 31 December 2010, the long-term expected rates of return on equity instruments and debt instruments were assumed to be 8.0% pa and 4.4% pa, respectively, for the plan.
The equivalent assumptions at 31 December 2009 were 8.2% pa and 4.6% pa respectively.
The post retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2009 projections, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 2010 is 86.6 years for males and 87.6 years for females.
For members with large pensions a longer lifetime is assumed 89.9 for males and 90.4 for females.
The post retirement mortality assumption has been updated since 2009 when expected future lifetimes were generally assumed to be 85.8 years for males aged 65 and 87.8 years for females, with longer lifetimes assumed for members with large pensions of 89.2 years for males and 91.0 years for females.
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 91 Financial statements Statutory reports and financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes continued Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement in respect of the plan.
For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact for the year ended 31December2010, excluding the impact on the associated deferred tax items: 2010 2009 m m 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.6 0.5 Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 18.7 18.1 This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value of the bond assets held by the plan.
1.0% pa decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the amount charged to staff costs 2.4 2.2 one year increase in life expectancy would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.1 0.1 Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 5.5 5.7 0.5% pa increase in price inflation would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.3 0.3 Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 9.8 8.8 Amounts for the current year and the prior four years are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 m m m m m Defined benefit obligation 228.6 227.4 196.5 208.5 208.1 Plan assets 263.1 242.4 217.3 242.1 230.7 Surplus 34.5 15.0 20.8 33.6 22.6 Experience gain loss on plan liabilities 4.0 3.5 1.7 5.8 3.0 Experience gain loss on plan assets 10.8 14.1 37.5 3.0 8.9 32 Share-based payments Ladbrokes plc has the following share-based payment plans, all of which are settled by equity: the Deferred Bonus Plan, the Performance Share Plan, the Ladbrokes Growth Plan, the International Share Option Scheme, the 1978 Share Option Scheme, the Restricted Share Plan, Sharesave, the OWN Plan, Freeshare and the 2010 Share Award Plan.
The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below.
i Deferred Bonus Plan For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus changed from half of the gross annual bonus in respect of the bonus year 2007 is delivered in shares that vest after three years.
For other employees, one third of the gross annual bonus changed from half of the gross annual bonus in respect of the bonus year 2007 is delivered in shares that vest after two years.
ii Performance Share Plan An award under the Performance Share Plan consists of a conditional allocation of shares that will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, at the end of the three year period.
The awards have two separate performance conditions: half of the award vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on EPS.
iii Ladbrokes Growth Plan Awards are subject to share price growth performance conditions.
Any share price target must be attained throughout a period of 30 consecutive dealing days and performance is assessed over a five year period.
Up to one third of the award may vest at the end of year three if the performance targets have been achieved at that time.
A further third may vest at the end of year four if the targets have been met at that time.
The remainder of the award may vest at the end of year five, subject to the achievement of the performance targets.
The award can take the form of a restricted interest in a share held jointly with Computershare Trustees CI Limited, the trustee of the Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust and a nil cost option, which together will entitle the executive to the value of a whole share.
iv International Share Option Scheme and the 1978 Share Option Scheme The share options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period.
Vested options lapse if they have not been exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
All options have an EPS growth based performance condition.
No options were granted in 2010 and there is no present intention to grant options in the future.
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 92 32 Share-based payments continued v Restricted Share Plan Awards under the Restricted Share Plan will vest in their entirety after three years.
However, for awards granted prior to May 2010, employees can elect for 50% of the award to vest after two years.
Awards are not subject to performance conditions.
vi 1983 Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave Under Sharesave, options are granted at a 20% discount to market value.
The scheme operates with a savings period of either three or five years, at the end of which the option may be exercised.
vii OWN Plan Under the OWN Plan, employees can contribute up to 75 per month to acquire shares.
For every two shares purchased, the Group provides a match of one additional share.
viii Freeshare Under Freeshare, an award of up to 250 in value was made to participating employees on reaching one years service.
No new awards will be made from 2011 onwards.
ix 2010 Share Award Plan An award under the 2010 Share Award Plan consists of a one-off compensatory share award to the Chief Executive in the form of a nil cost option.
The award is not subject to performance conditions and will vest after three years.
For a more detailed description of each of the above plans, refer to the Directors remuneration report.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised an expense of 3.8 million 2009: 3.9 million relating to equity settled share-based payment transactions.

Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 94 33 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings.
The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be summarised as follows: Lease terms Shop leases are typically 15 years with a tenant only break clause at 10 years and rent reviews every five years.
Other leases are typically between three and 10 years.
Determination of rent payments Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
Terms of renewal The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor.
Restrictions There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing lease arrangements.
Subleases The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.
