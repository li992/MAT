Premier Farnell Annual Report and Accounts 2010 97 Financial statements: Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION On 2 February 2009 the Group adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
This has not affected the financial results of the Group, but has resulted in a change to the Groups reportable segmental disclosures.
The previous two divisions within the Marketing and Distribution Division have been split in to three divisions with CPC previously in MDD Europe and Asia Pacific and MCM previously in MDD Americas now both categorised as Other Distribution Businesses.
Comparatives have been re-presented accordingly.
The Group is organised into four reportable business segments: the Marketing and Distribution Division MDD, comprising the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific and Other Distribution Businesses, and the Industrial Products Division IPD.
The segments presented below are consistent with the information presented to the Board which is deemed to be the Groups chief operating decision-maker, CODM.
The Board considers the Group businesses based on an activity and geographic perspective.
For the purposes of the segmental information disclosed below, operating segments with similar economic characteristics have been aggregated into reportable segments, on the basis of similarities relating to their products, services, type and class of customer and method of distribution.
Further information on the nature of products are services is contained within the Operational Review of this Annual Report.

On 31 July 2009, the Groups North American pension plans were closed to further accrual of defined benefit obligations, with members being transferred to a money purchase plan.
This resulted in a net one-off accounting gain of 6.3 million and an associated tax charge of 2.4 million.
Of the 6.3 million, 5.0 million related to MDD Americas, 0.3 million to MDD Other Distribution Businesses, and 1.0 million to the IPD.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume issue of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options and awards with a non-market based performance condition granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year, and those shares with a market based performance condition based on the current estimate of the number of shares that will vest under the performance criteria.

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill of 26.6 million 2009: 26.6 million for the purpose of impairment testing has been allocated to the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell UK part of MDD Europe and Asia Pacific Division.
The recoverable amounts have been measured based on value in use.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations, which were performed for the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell UK, based on data available at the mid-point of the financial year, were as follows: sales growth for the current year was based on internal forecasts with growth in the five subsequent years broadly inline with historic UK GDP and a terminal growth rate of 2.25% 2009: 2.25% : gross margins were projected based on recent trends: a market risk premium, of 5.0% 2009: 7.0%, was used in calculating the weighted average cost of capital.
Forecast cash flows have been prepared for a period of five years.
From the second year onwards, the rate of growth used does not exceed the long term growth rate for the industry in which the business operates.
The cash flows that these projections produce have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10.6% 2009: 11.4%.
No impairment arose during the year as a result of this test.
The remaining goodwill of 8.2 million 2009: 5.9 million is allocated across six different cash generating units and includes 2.8 million relating to acquisitions in the year.
Impairment tests have been performed on the other amounts based on value in use and using similar assumptions to that above.
No impairments arose during the year in relation to these amounts.
The Directors believe there are no reasonably possible changes to a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.

Premier Farnell Annual Report and Accounts 2010 107 Financial statements: Consolidated Financial Statements 15 PREFERENCE SHARES Cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each 2010 2009 Number Number Authorised 32,000,000 32,000,000 Allotted, called up and fully paid 3,949,419 3,949,419 Under IAS 39, the Companys cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares are required to be split into debt and equity components with the preference dividend being classified as a finance cost.
The fair value of the debt element is established on issue of the shares, based on the discounted cash flows of the instrument to the date of maturity and is then increased each year on a straight-line basis through the income statement in order to arrive at the redemption amount payable on maturity of the shares.
The movement in the debt and equity elements during the year is as follows: Equity Debt element element m m At 2 February 2009 10.4 59.4 Premium on redemption 0.8 At 31 January 2010 10.4 60.2 2010 2009 m m Preference dividends paid 3.5 3.5 The Company did not purchase any of its preference shares in the year.
In the prior year, the Company purchased and cancelled 1.8 million of its preference shares at a total cash cost of 23.6 million.
Based on the book value and fair value of the instrument at the date of purchase, the financial liability element of the preference shares was reduced by 27.4 million and the equity element by 4.8 million.
A gain of 3.7 million was recognised in the income statement being the difference between the book value and fair value of the financial liability element at the date of purchase.
The gain arising from the difference between the book value and fair value of the equity element of 4.8 million was recognised as a movement in retained earnings.
A deferred tax credit of 0.8 million arose which was recognised as a movement in retained earnings.
A transfer from retained earnings of 1.8 million to non-distributable reserves was made in order to maintain the legal nominal value of share capital.
At 31 January 2010, the preference shares comprised 137,223 2009: 143,369 US$1.35 cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the US preference shares and 3,812,196 2009: 3,806,050 89.2 pence cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the sterling preference shares and, together with the US preference shares, the preference shares.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the preference shares are as follows: 1 CURRENCY Holders of preference shares are entitled to receive a preferential dividend, a distribution on a winding-up and a payment on redemption.
Holders of US preference shares receive such payments in US dollars.
Holders of sterling preference shares receive such payments in sterling.
2 CHANGEOVER A holder of US preference shares may serve notice on the Company requiring that some or all of their US preference shares be changed to sterling preference shares.
108 Premier Farnell Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial statements: Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 15 PREFERENCE SHARES CONTINUED 3 INCOME a Each holder has a right to receive a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of US$1.35 per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and at the rate of 89.2 pence per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares.
Dividends on the preference shares are payable half-yearly in arrears in equal amounts, on 26 January and 26 July.
b The fixed cumulative preferential dividends payable in respect of the preference shares are paid in priority to any dividend payable to the holders of ordinary shares and in priority to or pari passu with the holders of any other class of preference shares in the capital of the Company.
c If a holder of US preference shares has elected to changeover his US preference shares to sterling preference shares then the fixed cumulative preferential dividend and any arrears payable after the changeover date will be paid at the sterling rate set out above.
4 CONVERSION a Each holder of preference shares is entitled to convert all or any of his fully paid preference shares into fully paid ordinary shares at the rate of 10.3432 pence in nominal amount of ordinary share capital for every 1 in nominal amount of preference share capital so converted the conversion rate.
b The preference shares may be converted on any date at the option of the holder on and from the date of issue up to and including 22 April 2016. c If at any time 75% or more of all the preference shares have been converted into ordinary shares but assuming, for this purpose only, that any preference shares which have been converted into ordinary shares pursuant to the special conversion right made available in 2002 had never been issued or converted, the Company may give written notice to the remaining holders of preference shares to convert the remaining preference shares into ordinary shares.
d The conversion rate may be subject to adjustment if, inter alia, the Company makes an issue of ordinary shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, a rights issue or another offer to ordinary shareholders or if there is a change of control in the Company following a take-over offer or if a capital distribution is made.
5 REDEMPTION The Company shall subject to any statutory restrictions on 29 April 2016 redeem all the US preference shares in issue at US$25 for every 1 of nominal value and all the sterling preference shares in issue at 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value.
6 VOTING Each preference share entitles the holder to receive notice of but not to attend or vote at general meetings of the Company save in limited circumstances.
Subject to being entitled to vote on any resolution, each holder of preference shares has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll every such holder has one vote for every ordinary share to which he would be entitled on conversion of his or her preference shares.
7 WINDING-UP Subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and conditions, on a return of capital on a winding-up of the Company the assets available for distribution will be applied, first, in paying to each holder of a preference share any arrears and accruals of the preferential dividend: second, in repaying US$25 for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares: third, in repaying the capital paid up on each ordinary share: and fourth, in distributing the remainder rateably among the members of the Company according to the amounts paid up on their respective holdings of shares in the Company, each preference share being treated for this purpose as if converted at the conversion rate applicable into fully paid ordinary shares immediately prior to the commencement of the winding-up.

110 Premier Farnell Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial statements: Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group is exposed to a number of different market risks in the normal course of business including liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
LIQUIDITY RISK Established procedures are in place to ensure that the operational and working capital requirements of the Group can be met at all times.
These include: weekly review, monitoring and forecasting of working capital requirements across Group companies: use of short term, local bank facilities: operation of short term money market dealing lines: the implementation and ongoing review of committed multi-currency bank facilities, which are available at short notice.
At 31 January 2010 the Group had in place two separate revolving credit facilities of 20 million and 150 million, expiring in May 2012 and January 2013 respectively.
Both facilities carry a LIBOR based floating rate of interest.
Based on these bank facilities, the Groups headroom on bank borrowings at 31 January 2010 was 82 million: since the year end the Group has entered into a US$75 million private shelf agreement with a US private placement investor.
The agreement allows the Group to issue US private placement notes on a bilateral basis.
The issuance period extends two years from the date of the agreement 31 March 2010, and the maturity of each shelf note issued shall be no more than ten years from the date of issuance.
Pricing of the notes is subject to an acceptable rate quote from the purchaser at the time of issue.
CREDIT RISK The Group has a customer credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through the use of customer credit limits.
Investments are allowed only in short term instruments and only with counterparties that have sound credit ratings.
The Groups treasury policy stipulates the minimum credit rating that a banking institution must have before deposits can be made.
Given the high credit quality of counterparties with whom the Group has investments, the Directors do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its expectations.
At 31 January 2010 and 1 February 2009 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset included in the balance sheet.
HEDGING INTEREST RATE RISK The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are entered into, where necessary, to achieve this appropriate mix.
At 31 January 2010 the Group had in place interest rate swaps covering 30 million and 10 million of debt.
Through these swaps the Group has swapped floating rate one month LIBOR for fixed rate interest for a period of three years.
At 1 February 2009 the Group was not party to any interest rate swaps.
At 31 January 2010, if interest rates on variable rate foreign currency denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.1 million lower higher 2009: 0.2 million.
At 31 January 2010, if interest rates on variable rate pound sterling denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.4 million lower higher 2009: 0.4 million.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Euro and US dollar.
The Group hedges significant foreign currency exposures in respect of forecast sales and purchases of inventory through foreign exchange contracts.
All such foreign exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cash flow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movement in foreign exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long term investments in overseas assets.
Premier Farnell Annual Report and Accounts 2010 111 Financial statements: Consolidated Financial Statements 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED At 31 January 2010, if the US dollar had weakened strengthened against the pound sterling by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would have been 0.5 million lower higher as a result of a similar one cent movement.
At 31 January 2010, if the Euro had weakened strengthened against the pound sterling by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would have been 0.2 million lower higher as a result of a similar one cent movement.
ESTIMATION OF FAIR VALUES The main methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: derivatives: forward exchange contracts are marked to market using listed market prices: interest rate swaps are marked to market using valuations provided by counterparty banks: interest-bearing loans and borrowings: fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows: convertible redeemable preference shares: fair value is based on quoted market prices: trade and other receivables payables: the notional amount for trade receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year are deemed to reflect their fair value.
NET FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group classifies both its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast trading transactions and its interest rate swaps hedging the interest rate risk arising from the Groups variable rate debt as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted trading transactions at 31 January 2010 was an asset of 1.1 million 1 February 2009: liability of 4.4 million, and the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedges against future movements in floating interest rates was a liability of 0.5 million 2009: nil, which were reflected in a hedging reserve at that date.
HEDGE OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES The Groups US dollar denominated private placement notes totalling $225 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its US subsidiaries.
The Groups Euro denominated unsecured loans of 25 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its Eurozone subsidiaries.
The fair value of the US dollar borrowings at 31 January 2010 was 156 million 1 February 2009: 180.7 million and the fair value of the Euro borrowings was 21.7 million 1 February 2009: 15.0 million.
FAIR VALUE OF LONG TERM BORROWINGS AND PREFERENCE SHARES The book and fair values of the Groups long term borrowings and preference shares are as follows: Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2010 2010 2009 2009 m m m m Long term borrowings 188.6 197.4 271.0 283.9 Preference shares 70.6 50.8 69.8 49.4 The book value of the preference shares at 31 January 2010 comprises the equity element of 10.4 million 2009: 10.4 million and the debt element of 60.2 million 2009: 59.4 million.

This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observed for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 2 : Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 January 2010.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total balance Assets m m m m Derivatives used for hedging 1.1 1.1 Total assets 1.1 1.1 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 0.5 0.5 Total liabilities 0.5 0.5 The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to the present value.
MATURITY OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group will take in to consideration the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, the level of debt and the number of shares in issue.
When monitoring capital, the Group takes into consideration its gearing ratio, both including and excluding its postretirement benefit obligations.
This is calculated as the ratio of net debt to total equity adjusted for post-retirement benefit obligations as appropriate.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings and the debt element of preference shares as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total equity is as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet.
The post-retirement benefit obligations are shown in note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
At the year end the net debt to total equity ratio adjusted to exclude post-retirement benefit obligations, and the associated deferred tax, was 14.6:1 2009: 15.5:1.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

The main performance condition was based on the growth of the Companys total shareholder return, TSR, share price growth and reinvested dividends over a three-year period relative to the companies in the FTSE mid-250 Index excluding investment trusts.
Following approval at the 12 June 2007 Annual General Meeting, the upper limit for awards was increased to 150% of salary in any one year.
In addition, half of the award made to Executive Directors is now subject to a relative TSR performance condition over a three-year period.

The weighted average expected return for each asset class is based on the asset allocation at the beginning of the year.
The actual expected return on plan assets for the year allows for changes in the investment allocations during the year.
For 2010 and 2009, the rates of longevity for the UK Plan are based on standard tables known as the 2000 series with long cohort improvements from 2000 and a plus two year age rating.

The UK equity investments may include a holding of Premier Farnell shares in the ratio of Premier Farnells market capitalisation to the market capitalisation of the UK FT-Actuaries All-Share Index.
The majority of the US plan assets were transferred to a Liability Driven Investment strategy during the fourth quarter of FY10.
The expected return on assets should closely follow the yields of the bonds that are used to construct the Citigroup curve and thus the discount rate is considered a reasonable estimate of future asset returns.
At 31 January 2010, 94.0% of the US plans assets were invested under this strategy, which comprised a mixture of corporate bonds, government bonds, swaps and futures.
The US plan assets at 31 January 2010 include ordinary shares issued by Premier Farnell plc with a fair value of 4.2 million 1 February 2009: 3.2 million.

B POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS In the US, the Group provides unfunded post-retirement medical benefits to certain US employees.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used to account for pension obligations.
The charge for the year was 0.8 million 2009: 0.6 million and the balance sheet obligation at 31 January 2010 amounted to 10.8 million 2009: 11.1 million.
The disclosures relating to post-retirement medical benefits are based on an actuarial valuation performed by Towers Watson, Actuaries and Pension Consultants, as at 31 January 2010.
The principal assumptions were as follows: 2010 2009 % % Discount rate 5.9% 6.5 Medical inflation 5.0 5.0 Life expectancy of a 60-year-old male current retiree 24 yrs 24 yrs Life expectancy of a 60-year-old male future retiree 25 yrs 25 yrs The assumed long term rate of medical inflation is 5.0% per annum.
In 2010, the initial rate has been assumed to be 8.5% which is assumed to reduce to the long term rate at 0.5% per annum over seven years.
In 2009, the initial rate was 9.0% assumed to reduce to the long term rate at 0.5% per annum over eight years.
For 2010, future life expectancy is based on RP 2000 mortality tables with generational projections using scale AA.
