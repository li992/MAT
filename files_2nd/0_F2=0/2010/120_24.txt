Accounting Policies 66 Notes to the Accounts 1 Segment reporting The management committee has been identi ed as the chief operating decision-maker.
The management committee reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The management committee has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The management committee considers the business from a product perspective.
This has led to the operating segments identi ed in the table below.
The performance of the operating segments is assessed by reference to their gross pro t. Still drinks Carbonates and water Other Total 12 months ended 30 January 2010 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 155,706 45,168 536 201,410 Gross pro t 88,867 13,931 459 103,257 Still drinks Carbonates and water Other Total 12 months ended 31 January 2009 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 141,368 27,945 385 169,698 Gross pro t 77,178 7,251 307 84,736 There are no intersegment sales.
All revenue is from external customers.
Other segments represent income from water coolers for the Findlays 19 litre water business, rental income for can vendors and other soft drink related items such as water cups.
The gross pro t from the segment reporting is reconciled to the total pro t before income tax as shown in the consolidated income statement.
All of the assets of the Group are managed by the management committee on a central basis rather than at a segment level.
As a result no reconciliation of segment assets to the total assets gure on the statement of financial position has been disclosed for any of the periods presented.
Each of the following items are included in the reportable segments costs and no adjustments are required in arriving at the costs included in the consolidated primary statements: 2010 2009 000 000 Capital expenditure 5,358 10,639 Depreciation and amortisation 7,885 7,358 Impairment of intangible assets 284 Impairment of plant and equipment 1,031 Impairment of assets classi ed as held for sale 464 Capital expenditure comprises cash additions to property, plant and equipment note 11.
The capital expenditure in the year to 31 January 2009 includes additions resulting from acquisitions through business combinations note 19.
The operating segments include segments which have been aggregated in accordance with IFRS 8.

The site has continued to be marketed for sale in the year to 30 January 2010 and the latest offers have indicated that the market value of the site was less than the carrying value in the statement of financial position.
As a result of this difference the carrying value has been written down to the market value.
During the year to 30 January 2010 the Group incurred 84,000 in relation to redundancy costs for the reorganisation following the acquisition of Groupe Rubicon Limited in the year to 31 January 2009.
During the year to 30 January 2010 the Group announced the future closure of its Mans eld production site.
This has resulted in the recognition of a provision of 1,820,000 note 21 in respect of the anticipated redundancy costs relating to the closure.
These costs are anticipated to be incurred over the 18 months to 31 July 2011 when the site is expected to cease production.
The exceptional credit of 130,000 included within the exceptional items for the year to 31 January 2009 is the release of a restructuring provision see note 21 that is no longer required in relation to the Atherton site, currently classi ed as an asset available for sale.
A further 66,000 note 21 of environmental obligations have been included in the exceptional costs for the year to 30 January 2010 relating to work that must be completed before the Group can leave the site.
As part of the closure plans for the Mans eld site a review has been carried out of the plant and equipment held at the site.
Whilst the site will continue to manufacture in the coming year plant and equipment has been identi ed as having a net book value in excess of its recoverable amount.
This has resulted in an impairment charge being made for 998,000 to reduce the plant and equipment to its recoverable amount.

This is in line with the requirement of IAS 33 Earnings per share.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The directors have proposed a final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 January 2010 of 16.85p per share amounting to a dividend of 6,559,000.
It will be paid on 4 June 2010 to shareholders who are on the Register of Members on 7 May 2010.
This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements in line with the requirements of IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 73 1 0 Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for goodwill and brands For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

These calculations use pre-tax cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period.
Cash ows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates stated below: 2010 2009 Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate Key assumptions % % % % % % Rubicon operating unit 40.46 2.25 8.66 38.18 2.25 8.63 Strathmore operating unit 32.10 8.66 30.01 8.63 Findlays operating unit 55.00 4.00 8.66 46.90 4.00 8.63 Taut operating unit 35.00 2.25 8.66 33.33 2.25 8.63 The Rubicon operating unit can be further allocated across carbonates and still drinks when determining the CGU required for impairment testing.
No impairment was identi ed through this allocation.
The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and managements expectation of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax.
The discount rate re ects managements estimate of pre-tax cost of capital.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a benchmark for the Group provided by an independent third party with an additional risk premium of 2% added to re ect the risk relating to individual brands.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the breakdown using latest annual budgets for the year to 29 January 2011 and projected costs thereafter.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates.
At a discount rate of 10% none of the CGUs were impaired.
The impairment of the water rights in the year to 31 January 2009 arose following declining volumes in the sales of Findlays water.
The decline was anticipated following the decision to change the focus for the Pitcox production site to the lling of 19 litre water containers.
No impairment of any other assets relating to the Pitcox operation was required.
No other class of asset other than the water rights was impaired.
Included in the impairment of assets is a charge of 33,000 for equipment that had become obsolete.
This has not been included in the exceptional costs as the equipment does not form part of the equipment used at the Mans eld site.
