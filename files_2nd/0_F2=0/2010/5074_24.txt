PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting The Parent Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed below, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Companys profit and loss account is not presented in these financial statements.
The Eaga plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2010 contain a consolidated cash flow statement, consequently, the Company has taken the exemption available in FRS1 Revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements, and has not presented its own cash flow statement.
Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives at the following rates: Land and buildings 2% Alterations to leasehold property Period of lease Fixtures and fittings 20-33% Equipment including IT equipment and software 20-50% A tangible fixed asset is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period the asset is fide-recognised.
Assets residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs incurred on the acquisition of tangible fixed assets are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Fixed Asset Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
Stock Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in first out basis and comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stock to its location and condition at the balance sheet date.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Leases Operating leases with annual rentals, net of any incentives received, are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Pension Scheme The Company operates a number of defined contribution plans.
The Company pays contributions to corporate or individually administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Company has no further obligation under these plans once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except: where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the Eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 81 1.
PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items credited or charged direct to equity in which case the deferred tax is also credited or charged to equity.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially translated into the functional currency by applying the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences on monetary assets are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the original transaction.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate when the fair value was determined.
Share-based Payments The Company allows employees to acquire its shares through share option schemes, details of which are in the Remuneration Report.
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market-based performance not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Company also operates a SIP under which qualifying Partners may receive free shares.
The fair value of the free shares is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the shares.
Financial Instruments Debtors and creditors are non-derivative financial assets or liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They are included within assets or liabilities at cost less impairment depending on when they fall due.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast transaction cash flow hedge.
The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
The fair value movements of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 6.
Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders equity are show in note 11.
The fair value of the hedging derivative is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in reserves.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects the profit and loss account.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the profit and loss account.
Accrued Income Accrued income represents revenue that has not yet been invoiced to the customer.
Further details of the Groups revenue recognition policy is set out on pages 52 and 53 of the Group financial statements.
