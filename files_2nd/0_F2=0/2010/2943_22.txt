Accordingly, the 2009 disclosure has been amended to refl ect this change.
Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units.
In the absence of any identifi ed impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash generating unit CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnerships projects, Middle East construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash generating units CGUs, within the Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
Our CGUs have been identifi ed within our reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash infl ows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The value in use in 2010 was determined on a similar basis to 2009.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2009 and revisited in 2010 in the light of the challenging economic environment.
The impact of the Comprehensive Spending Review on the fi financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their fi financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 73 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 11.
Intangible assets continued Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that refl ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has four CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services excluding the Middle East are consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services CGUs are consistent so one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
In determining the discount rate management have sought to arrive at a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash fl ows for the CGUs in Construction services excluding the Middle East was 12.0 per cent 2009: 12.4 per cent and for the CGUs in Support services was 9.4 per cent 2009: 9.5 per cent.
The annual growth rates are based on internal assessments.
Growth is expected in the Business services CGU at 5.0 per cent for the next fi five years, 2.5 per cent growth per annum for years six to ten which refl ects expected changes to the Retail Price Index and no growth thereafter.
In respect of the Construction services excluding the Middle East segment, the cash fl ow forecast used assumes no growth, fully refl ecting the expected reduction in UK construction revenue which is largely offset by revenue growth in Canada.
These growth rates do not exceed the long-term industry average and refl ect the synergies from recent acquisitions.
The Group prepares cash fl ow forecasts derived from the most recent fi financial budgets approved by management for the following year and extrapolates cash fl ows based upon the growth rates indicated above.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to increase to 12.9 per cent for Support services and to 23.5 per cent for Construction services before an impairment was triggered.
In addition management have considered whether there would have been an impairment if the Building and Infrastructure units had remained separate.
Management have concluded that no such impairment would have arisen.
As at 31 December 2010, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 31.6 million 2009: 33.0 million is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 119.0 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 will be 79 per cent complete by 2016.
The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 125.4 million arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in 2008 will be 84 per cent complete by 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing until 2019.

During 2009, the Group disposed of four PPP investments as disclosed in note 29.
As disclosed in note 35, the Group has equity interests in a number of PPP jointly controlled entities that are in excess of 50 per cent of the issued share capital of the entities concerned.
The Group accounts for these interests using the equity method as the power to govern the fi financial and operating policies of the entities is shared under the terms of the shareholder agreements.
The Groups aggregate share of net assets of jointly controlled entities is analysed below.
Borrowing within jointly controlled entities amounting to 921.9 million 2009: 736.7 million are without recourse to the Carillion Group.
Non-current assets within PPP projects include cumulative capitalised interest amounting to 3.8 million 2009: 3.8 million.
On adoption of IFRIC 12 capitalised interest on other current assets has been written off through reserves as a prior year adjustment.
Financial instrument derivatives within PPP projects relate to interest rate swaps entered into by the jointly controlled entities concerned as a means of hedging interest rate risk and are stated net of deferred tax.
In accordance with International Accounting Standard 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, these derivatives are accounted for as cash fl ow hedges with the effective portion of movements in fair value each year recognised in the hedging reserve.

Following the disposal of the Groups 32.5 per cent interest in Aspire Defence Holdings Limited on 4 December 2009, the remaining 17.5 per cent non-quoted equity interest that the Group retained was reclassifi ed to other non-current investments.
Upon reclassifi cation, the Groups interest was recognised at fair value, which equated to book value on the date of reclassifi cation.
Fair value is based on the discounted future cash fl ows expected to arise from the investment.
On 21 December 2010 the Group disposed of a further fi five per cent of its equity interest and as a result the Groups equity interest was 12.5 per cent at the balance sheet date see note 29.
The remaining other investments cost of 13.8 million relates to the non-quoted equity investment in the Alice Springs to Darwin railway.
The investment has been fully impaired following the project being placed in administration.

The fi first reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28 per cent to 27 per cent was substantively enacted on 21 July 2010 and will be effective from 1 April 2011 and its impact is highlighted in note 7.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further three per cent rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Companys future current tax charge and reduce the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.

Reserves Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the fi financial statements of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash fl ow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on acquisition of Mowlem on 23 February 2006 and Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The Group has opted to credit the merger reserve rather than the share premium account as permitted by The Companies Act.
The 26.3 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 January 1.1 1.3 Share options exercised by employees exercise price 3.7 0.5 Proceeds from exercise of share options 2.3 Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 0.6 3.9 Acquisition of own shares 5.6 4.2 At 31 December 0.1 1.1 80 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 23.

During the year the Company acquired 2.3 million of its own shares for 5.6 million to meet the plans future commitments.
The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP, the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
During the year, 4,704 ordinary shares 2009: 91,376 in the Company held by the QUEST were transferred to employees of the Group following the exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme.
At 31 December 2010 the total number of shares held under the QUEST amounted to 129,979 2009: 134,683 and had a market value of 0.5 million 2009: 0.4 million.
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to shares in the Company.
Full details of share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 46 to 51.
The recognition and measurement principles in International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share-based payment IFRS 2 have not been applied to grants of options before 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in International Financial Reporting Standard 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 2.

The income recognised for share options granted in 2006 of 2.2 million could only be recognised after the vesting period expired on 31 July 2010.
The expected life of the options is taken to be the full vesting period, as historical exercise patterns have shown this to be appropriate.
The estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest ignores the possibility that market conditions will or will not be achieved given that these market conditions are already included in the fair value of the options.

Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its construction activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups fi financial position.
There are no liabilities of jointly controlled entities for which the Group is contingently liable.

Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups fi financial risk management policies are to minimise potential adverse effects on fi financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal fi financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profi t centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East, Canada and the Caribbean.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or where this is not practicable in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profi ts arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are signifi cant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 83 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 26.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2010 2009 m m United States of America Dollar 17.6 15.6 Canadian Dollar 82.0 91.6 United Arab Emirates Dirham 7.9 7.6 Other 2.1 0.5 109.6 115.3 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 109.6 million 2009: 115.3 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency asset amounts to 65.4 million 2009: 61.6 million.
The whole of the foreign exchange loss of 3.8 million 2009: 1.0 million gain on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve as these hedging loans are effective hedges.
The Group does not have a signifi cant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of fi financial assets.
Each movement of fi five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profi t before tax and equity as follows: Five per cent increase Five per cent decrease Profi t Equity Profi t Equity m m m m United States of America Dollar 0.8 0.8 Canadian Dollar 0.4 4.3 0.5 4.8 Euro 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.4 United Arab Emirates Dirham 1.6 3.5 1.8 3.9 Oman Rials 1.0 0.3 0.1 1.4 Danish Kroner 1.1 1.2 Other 0.2 0.9 0.2 0.9 Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowing to fund ongoing working capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to fl oating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.2 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.6 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 0.8 million, and in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowings an increase of 0.1 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that suffi cient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry signifi cant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated facility, a bilateral facility and short term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
The average net borrowing during 2010 was 41.8 million 2009: 274.4 million.

Undrawn committed borrowing facilities measured against the new facilities at 31 December 2010 would be 7.2million expiring within one year and 546.8 million expiring after fi five years.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on fi financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging contracts.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each fi financial asset.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the 31 December 2010 by geographic region was: 2010 2009 m m United Kingdom 150.2 197.8 Middle East 39.8 32.9 Canada and the Caribbean 86.7 71.6 Rest of the World 3.4 1.7 280.1 304.0 The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the 31 December 2010 by segment was: 2010 2009 m m Support services 124.8 137.0 Public Private Partnership projects 0.1 0.1 Middle East construction services 39.8 32.9 Construction services excluding the Middle East 115.4 134.0 280.1 304.0 The Groups most signifi cant customer, the UK Government, accounts for 46.6 million of the trade receivables carrying amount at 31 December 2010.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 85 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 26.
Financial instruments continued Trade receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The ageing of trade receivables is as follows: 2010 2009 Net Net trade receivables Impairment trade receivables Impairment m m m m Not past due 177.3 181.1 Past due less than three months 72.1 0.5 85.0 0.8 Past due between three and six months 13.1 1.6 19.4 4.6 Past due between six and 12 months 4.3 0.5 8.1 1.5 Past due more than 12 months 13.3 5.2 10.4 2.7 280.1 7.8 304.0 9.6 2010 2009 m m At 1 January 9.6 16.8 Provision created 0.5 2.9 Provision utilised 1.4 7.6 Provision released 0.9 2.5 At 31 December 7.8 9.6 Whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased, on balance the Group believes that debtors will meet their payment obligation in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2010.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a signifi cant amount of credit risk.
Derivative fi financial instruments 2010 2009 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Forward foreign currency contracts 0.2 1.0 The movement in fair value of forward foreign currency contracts has been recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range spanning up until February 2040.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash fl ow hedges within jointly controlled entities in the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2010 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate 1 derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 107.4 million 2009: 31.6 million of which 35.1 million 2009 : 17.2 million 1 and the related deferred tax asset of 9.5 million 2009 : 4.8 million has been recognised in the hedging reserve.
Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-current asset investments and derivative fi financial instruments.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on market data.
Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash fl ows using asset specifi c discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available for sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of derivative fi financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
The movement in the fair value of non-current asset investment derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: m 1 At 1 January 2010 46.2 Additions 3.9 Disposals 14.1 Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 5.9 At 31 December 2010 41.9 1 Restated on adoption of IFRIC 12 see note 32.
The fair value of non current investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 4.5 million.

IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualifi ed actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 31 December 2010 31 December 2009 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 4.40% 2.00% 4.40% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions 3.40% 2.00% 3.40% 2.00% Infl ation rate RPI 3.40% 2.00% 3.40% 2.00% Infl ation rate CPI 2.80% N A N A N A Discount rate 5.40% 5.33% 5.80% 6.25% Where schemes have adopted the 2.5 per cent per annum cap on increases to pensions in payment the assumption is 2.4 per cent per annum 2009: 2.4 per cent p. a. rather than the higher amount shown above.
For the majority of schemes, the infl ation assumption for certain benefi ts is now based on the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI following the change announced by the UK Government in 2010.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to signifi cant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

Retirement benefi t obligations continued For all schemes, except the Railways Pension Scheme, the mortality assumptions adopted have been updated in 2010 and are SINA YoB mc tables with a 1 per cent fl oor and scheme specifi c age ratings.
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specifi c assumptions based on industry experience.

This is still being adopted for the Carillion Public Sector scheme until the next valuation.
For the Planned Maintenance Engineering Scheme the previous base was PA92 YOB MC for both retired and non retired members.
The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefi ts under the local GAAP, CICA 3461.
The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental infl ation rates in relation to the Post Retirement Benefi t Plan.
The immediate trend rate is seven per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of three per cent per annum 2030.
An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by 0.8 million and the total service cost by 0.1 million.
A decrease of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by 0.6 million and total service cost by 0.1 million.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock and the Actuarys recommendation on the allowance for the potential long-term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Comprehensive Income as permitted under IAS 19.

The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme defi cit recognised on transition to IFRS of 85.2 million and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a signifi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fi financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to fi final out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of fi final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specifi c risks within each contract that have been identifi ed during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated fi final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to fi final out turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash fl ows and profi tability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash fl ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 11 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Retirement benefi ts In determining the valuation of defi ned benefi t pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: expected return on plan assets infl ation rate mortality discount rate salary and pension increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 30.

New accounting standards and interpretations As described in note 1, IFRIC 12 clarifi es the accounting for Public Private Partnership PPP projects which the Group participates in through jointly controlled entities.
The overall impact of IFRIC 12 is to change the timing of when profi ts are recognised in PPP projects but it does not impact the total profi t recognised or cash fl ows during the life of the PPP project.
This has resulted in a restatement of the Groups share of the results of jointly controlled entities and the non-operating profi t arising from the disposal of investments in jointly controlled entities.
The adoption of IFRIC 12 has had an impact on the Groups share of movements in the fair value of interest rate swaps within PPP jointly controlled entities.
For a number of jointly controlled entities, the impact of IFRIC 12 on its carrying value in the Groups balance sheet requires the Groups share of fair value movements in interest rate swaps to be restricted to avoid the carrying value of the jointly controlled entities concerned from becoming negative.
This adjustment has been refl ected in the statement of comprehensive income.
Upon the adoption of IFRIC 12 on 1 January 2010 the Group has restated prior period information, which has had the following impact on reported profi t, earnings per share and net assets: Year ended 31 December m unless otherwise stated 2009 Income statement Total revenue as previously reported 5,426.5 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 12 202.8 Total revenue as restated 5,629.3 Share of jointly controlled entities revenue as previously reported 922.3 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 12 202.8 Share of jointly controlled entities revenue as restated 1,125.1 Profi t before tax as previously reported 147.7 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 12 on share of jointly controlled entities operating profi t 1.5 net fi financial expense 7.8 taxation 2.6 1 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 12 on underlying profi t before tax 6.7 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 12 on non-operating items 5.1 Profi t before tax as restated 135.9 Earnings per share as previously reported pence 33.4 Impact of IFRIC 12 as noted above pence 2.9 Earnings per share as restated pence 30.5 Diluted earnings per share as previously reported pence 33.2 Impact of IFRIC 12 as noted above pence 2.9 Diluted earnings per share as restated pence 30.3 Statement of comprehensive income Share of recycled cash fl ow hedges within jointly controlled entities as previously reported 9.9 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 12 1.6 Share of recycled cash fl ow hedges within jointly controlled entities as restated 8.3 Share of change in fair value of effective cash fl ow hedges within jointly controlled entities as previously reported 8.3 Impact of adoption of IFRIC 12 4.1 Share of change in fair value of effective cash fl ow hedges within jointly controlled entities as restated 4.2 1 As defi ned in note 8b.

In the year ended 31 December 2010, the adoption of IFRIC 12 reduced the Groups share of results of jointly controlled entities and therefore 1 1 underlying profi t before tax from 192.3 million to 188.1 million and consequently underlying earnings per share reduced from 40.4 pence to 39.4 pence.
The adoption of IFRIC 12 also increased non-operating profi t in the year ended 31 December 2010 by 6.1 million, therefore reported profi t before tax increased from 161.8 million to 167.9 million and consequently basic earnings per share increased from 36.4 pence to 36.9 pence and diluted earnings per share increased from 36.2 pence to 36.7 pence.
In the statement of comprehensive income, IFRIC 12 reduced the loss recognised on the Groups share of the change in fair value of effective cash fl ow hedges within jointly controlled entities by 5.3 million.
The adoption of IFRIC 12 increased net assets in the year ended 31 December 2010 by 7.2 million.
Off-balance sheet arrangements The Group is party to a number of contractual arrangements for the purposes of the Groups principal activities that are not required to be included on the Group balance sheet.
The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Group are party to are as follows: operating leases see note 27 pledged assets securing fi finance lease liabilities see note 10 guarantees for deferred equity payments and performance of contracts for PPP customers see note 25 capital commitments for capital expenditure and equity and subordinated debt in PPP controlled entities see note 27 outsourcing contracts.
In respect of outsourcing contracts, the Group has entered into various arrangements to outsource the provision of certain back-offi ce functions with a third party provider.
These arrangements are on commercial terms and any penalty or termination clauses associated with these arrangements will not have material impact on the fi financial position of the Group.
Post-balance sheet events In February 2011, the Group extended its banking facilities by securing a syndicated facility of 737.5 million which is repayable in March 2016 together with a 364-day 15.0 million facility.
On 11 February 2011, Carillion plc reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Eaga plc, a leading provider of energy effi ciency solutions in the UK, for a total consideration of 306.5 million.
The acquisition is subject to approval by the shareholders of Eaga plc, change of control approval from the Financial Services Authority and confi rmation by the Court, and is expected to become effective in April 2011.
