During the year the Company received a further 75,000 in respect of the VAT on investment administration fees incurred between 2004 and 2007.
No further VAT refunds or interest were expected or received during the year under review.
The write-backs of VAT were allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
The 75,000 recognised in the year has been allocated wholly to the revenue return.
The interest paid by HMRC on the VAT recovered was included in other income.
There remain outstanding claims relating to the period 1996 to 2000 and claims for compound interest from 1990 onwards.
No amounts have been recognised in respect of these claims as it is currently uncertain whether any further amounts will be recovered.
25 Subsequent events Since the year end, the Company has bought back 1,090,220 of its ordinary shares see also page 26.
Since the year end, the Board has declared a second interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2010 of 6.5p per ordinary share see also pages 23 and 24 and note 8 on page 54.
Warning to Shareholders Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
Shareholders are therefore advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
Please note that it is very unlikely that either the Company or the Companys Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders and that any such calls would relate only to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never in respect of investment advice.
If you are in any doubt about the veracity of an unsolicited phone call, please call either the Company Secretary or the Registrar at the numbers provided on page 72.
