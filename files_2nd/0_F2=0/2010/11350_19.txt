Operating costs increased by 8.4 million 2% to 428.9 million.
At NWL, operating costs have increased from 380.1 million to 388.9 million.
This increase principally reflects the impact of increases in salaries, abstraction and rates plus one-off charges for bad debt relating to the closure of a major customer 1.7 million and a provision for early retirement and severance costs 5.4 million.
These increases have been partially offset by efficiencies, including the benefit of reduced power prices and the commissioning of the advanced anaerobic digestion plant at Bran Sands on Teesside during the year.
Energy costs at NWL for the year to 31 March 2010 were 36.4 million 2009: 38.8 million and are expected to reduce by around 4.0 million for the following year.

These savings will be sustained as NWL has now procured its entire electricity requirement through to March 2015 at prices below the level funded in the final determination.
