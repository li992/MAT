Proven and Probable Commercial Reserves are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
Reserves estimates for each field are reviewed by the independent engineer based on significant new data or a material change with a review of each field undertaken at least every two years.
Proven and Probable Contingent Resources are based on both Tullows estimates and the Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
The contingent resources acquisition in 2010 relates to the purchase of a 50% working interest in Blocks 1 and 3A in Uganda from Heritage Oil and Gas Ltd. 4.
The total Commercial Reserves and Contingent Resources of 1,387.5 mmboe at 31 December 2010 include a 100% working interest in Blocks 1, 2 and 3A in Uganda.
Post completion of the farm-down transaction with Total and CNOOC in Uganda, total Commercial Reserves and Contingent Resources are expected to reduce to 869 mmboe.
The Group provides for depletion and amortisation of tangible fixed assets on a net entitlements basis, which reflects the terms of the Production Sharing Contracts related to each field.
Total net entitlement reserves were 231.6 mmboe at 31 December 2010 31 December 2009: 265.4 mmboe.
Contingent Resources relate to resources in respect of which development plans are in the course of preparation or further evaluation is underway with a view to development within the foreseeable future.
