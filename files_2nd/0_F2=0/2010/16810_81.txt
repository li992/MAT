The pre-tax adjusted discount rate used in the most recent value in use in the year ended 31 March 2010 calculation are as follows: Pre-tax adjusted discount rate India 13.8% Turkey 17.6% India During the year ended 31 March 2010 the goodwill in relation to the Groups operations in India was impaired by 2,300 million primarily due to intense price competition following the entry of a number of new operators into the market.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the previous value in use calculation at 31 March 2009 was 12.3%.
Turkey During the year ended 31 March 2010 impairment losses of 200 million, previously recognised in respect of intangible assets in relation to the Groups operations in Turkey, were reversed.
The reversal was in relation to licences and spectrum and was as a result of favourable changes in the discount rate.
The cash flow projections within the business plans used for impairment testing were substantially unchanged from those used at 31 March 2009.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the previous value in use calculation at 31 March 2009 was 19.5%.
Year ended 31 March 2009 The impairment losses were based on value in use calculations.

Turkey During the year ended 31 March 2009 the goodwill and other intangible assets in relation to the Groups operations in Turkey was impaired by 2,250 million.
At 30 September 2008 the goodwill was impaired by 1,700 million following adverse movements in the discount rate and adverse performance against previous plans.
During the second half of the 2009 financial year, impairment losses of 300 million in relation to goodwill and 250 million in relation to licences and spectrum resulted from adverse changes in both the discount rate and a fall in the long-term GDP growth rate.
The cash flow projections within the business plans used for impairment testing were substantially unchanged from those used at 30 September 2008.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the previous value in use calculation at 31 January 2008 was 16.2%.
Ghana During the year ended 31 March 2009 the goodwill in relation to the Groups operations in Ghana was impaired by 250 million following an increase in the discount rate.
The cash flow projections within the business plan used for impairment testing was substantially unchanged from the acquisition business case in 2008.

Budgeted capital expenditure The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital expenditure required to roll out networks in emerging markets, to provide enhanced voice and data products and services and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the Groups licences.
Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software.
Long-term growth rate For businesses where the five year management plans are used for the Groups value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and the long-term compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
For businesses where the plan data is extended for an additional five years for the Groups value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and the compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years eight to ten of the management plan.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is based on the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market, where possible adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the required increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the Groups operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed mobile telecommunications companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory.
Management has used a forward-looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the average equity market risk premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in evaluating acquisition proposals.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
31 March 2010 The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups operations in India equalled its respective carrying value and, consequently, any adverse change in key assumption would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups operations in Turkey, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain and the UK exceeded their carrying value by approximately 130 million, 4,752 million, 18 million, 118 million, 259 million, 1,253 million, 1,182 million, 372 million, 821 million, 1,207 million respectively.
