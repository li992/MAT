42 Reinsurance assets This note details the reinsurance recoverables on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.
a Carrying amounts The reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised: 2010 2009 m m Long-term business Insurance contracts 3,650 4,299 Participating investment contracts 2 Non-participating investment contracts 1,463 1,258 Outstanding claims provisions 104 40 5,219 5,597 General insurance and health Outstanding claims provisions 1,113 1,194 Provisions for claims incurred but not reported 445 449 1,558 1,643 Provision for unearned premiums 307 332 1,865 1,975 Total 7,084 7,572 Of the above total, 4,675 million 2009: 4,493 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
b Assumptions The assumptions, including discount rates, used for reinsurance contracts follow those used for insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets are valued net of an allowance for their recoverability.
c Movements The following movements have occurred in the reinsurance asset during the year: i In respect of long-term business provisions 2010 2009 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 5,557 5,565 Asset in respect of new business 358 412 Expected change in existing business asset 208 57 Variance between actual and expected experience 81 35 Impact of other operating assumption changes 443 189 Impact of economic assumption changes 25 250 Other movements 486 318 555 Change in asset 367 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 174 41 Foreign exchange rate movements 61 334 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,115 5,557 The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets.
The reduction in the reinsurance asset from assumption changes mainly relates to assurance mortality assumptions in the UK and Ireland, with a corresponding reduction made to gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.
