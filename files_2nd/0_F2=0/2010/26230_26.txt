The capital contribution to the subsidiaries is accounted for as an increase in the investment in the parent companys financial statements.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimate, if any, in the cost of the investment in the subsidiary and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the accumulated capital contribution and the actual cost to the Company is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
Any capital contribution is subsequently recharged to the respective subsidiary as incurred and the corresponding cost of investment is reduced.
