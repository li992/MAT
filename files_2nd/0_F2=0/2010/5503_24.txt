Summary of significant accounting policies continued The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Production taxes In addition to corporate income taxes, the Groups financial statements also include and disclose production taxes on net income determined from oil and gas production.
The Group distinguishes between income tax and production tax.
Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT and is accounted for under IAS 12 since it has the characteristics of an income tax as it is imposed under Government authority and the amount payable is based on taxable profits of the relevant fields.
Current and deferred PRT is provided on the same basis as described above for income taxes.
Segment information Management have considered the requirements of IFRS 8, in regard to the determination of operating segments, and concluded that the Group has only one operating segment being the exploration for, and the extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf.

Deferred tax assets of US$5,149,000 2009: nil were recognised in 2010 on the acquisition of Stratic note 11 in relation to unutilised tax losses.
The tax losses relate to UK trading losses arising in Stratic Energy UK Limited prior to 2010, recoverability of which is dependent on future taxable trading profits in excess of those arising from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in that company.
It is anticipated that Stratic Energy UK Limited will generate taxable trading profits in the future in excess of the losses carried forward, and this company had taxable trading profits in 2010.

EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 69 notes to tHe grouP financial statements CONTINUED 11. business combinations acquisition of stratic On 5 November 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Stratic, an oil and gas company operating principally in the United Kingdom.
The acquisition was satisfied by the issue and allotment of 24,434,983 EnQuest Ordinary shares note 17.
The acquisition of Stratic enhanced the Groups proven and probable oil and gas reserves in the UKCS and also consolidated its position in the West Don asset, providing a further 17.25% working interest in the asset.
The provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Stratic, as at the date of the acquisition, are analysed below: Provisional fair value recognised on acquisition US$000 assets Property, plant and equipment 131,486 Intangible oil and gas assets 22,809 Deferred tax assets 5,149 Inventories 2,215 Trade receivables 55 Other receivables and prepayments 4,506 Cash 5,421 171,641 liabilities Provision decommissioning 10,840 Loans and borrowings 87,969 Trade and other payables 9,793 Accrued expenses 10,692 119,294 Total identifiable net assets at fair value 52,347 Goodwill arising on acquisition 1,816 Consideration 54,163 Purchase consideration transferred: 24,434,983 Ordinary 0.05 enquest shares 54,163 The fair values are provisional due to the complexity of the acquisition and due to the inherently uncertain nature of a number of the critical accounting estimates.
The review of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired will be completed within 12 months of the acquisition.
From the date of acquisition, Stratic has contributed US$6,511,000 to revenue and US$70,000 to the net profit before tax of the Group.
If the above combination had taken place at the beginning of 2010, net profit of the Group would have been US$28,767,000 and revenue would have been US$608,210,000.
The goodwill recognised above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the assets and activities of Stratic with those of the Group.
None of the recognised goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes.
Business combination expenses of US$5,289,000 relating to the above transactions have been expensed in the year 2009: nil.
lns capital restructuring On 6 April 2010, EnQuest acquired 100% of the voting rights of LNS, an oil and gas exploration and production company operating in the UK Continental Shelf.
The acquisition was satisfied by the issue and allotment of EnQuest Ordinary shares note 17.
For financial reporting purposes, the combination of LNS with EnQuest has been accounted for as a capital restructuring under the pooling of interests method.
On 6 June 2010, LNS changed its name to EnQuest North Sea BV.
acquisition of PeDl On 5 April 2010, EnQuest acquired 100% of the voting shares of PEDL, an oil and gas development and production company operating in the UK Continental Shelf.
The acquisition, which was satisfied by the issue and allotment of EnQuest Ordinary shares note 17, has been accounted for using the acquisition method.
The Group financial statements include the results of PEDL for the period from its acquisition date.

The fair value of the purchase consideration transferred to acquire PEDL was derived from the opening day share price of EnQuest shares on 6 April 2010, as quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
From the date of acquisition, PEDL has contributed US$281,612,000 to revenue and US$75,759,000 to the net profit before tax of the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the period, the net profit before tax of the Group for the period would have been US$54,311,000 and revenue would have been US$614,357,000.
The goodwill recognised above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the assets and activities of PEDL with those of the Group.
On 6 May 2010, PEDL changed its name to EnQuest Dons Limited.
Business combination expenses of US$1,733,000 relating to the above transactions have been expensed in the period 2009: nil.
Goodwill A summary of the movement in goodwill is presented below: 2010 2009 us$000 US$000 At 1 January Acquisitions during the year note 11 : Petrofac Energy Developments Limited 100,102 Stratic Energy Corporation 1,816 At 31 December 101,918 Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single cash-generating unit CGU, the UKCS, being the Groups only operating segment and therefore the lowest level that goodwill is reviewed by the Board.
impairment testing of goodwill The Group performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2010.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU, including goodwill, is compared with its recoverable amount.
EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2010 71 notes to tHe grouP financial statements CONTINUED 12.
Goodwill continued The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined on a value in use basis using a discounted cash flow model comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections.
The discount rate used is derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Risks specific to assets within the CGU are reflected within the cash flow forecasts.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The key assumptions required for the calculation of value in use of the CGU are: oil prices production volumes discount rates Oil prices are based on managements assessment of oil price using publicly available forecast commodity prices.
For the purposes of calculating value in use, management has applied an oil price assumption of US$85 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum.
Production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the CGU.
The production volumes used in the value in use calculations are supported by the Groups independent reserve assessment experts.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The WACC takes in to account both debt and equity.
The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Groups investors.
The cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing borrowings.
Segment risk is incorporated by applying a beta factor based on publicly available market data.
The discount rate applied to the Groups pre-tax cash flow projections is 19% 2009: n a.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions There are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could erode the estimated amount of US$640,000,000 by which the calculated value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU.
These are discussed below: oil price: management has considered the possibility of lower oil prices in the future.
Revenue for the Groups future oil production is directly linked to the market price of Brent blend oil.
A fall in the price for Brent blend production would directly impact the Groups revenue and potentially the economic life of assets in the CGU.
It is estimated that the long-term price of oil that would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of the CGU would be in the order of US$65 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum.
production volumes: estimated production volumes are based on detailed data for the Groups portfolio of assets taking in to account asset-by-asset development plans agreed by management as part of the planning process.
It is estimated that production would need to fall by 24% across all assets for the whole of the next 19 years to cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying amount of the CGU.

Joint venture receivables relate to billings to joint venture partners and were not impaired.
One joint venture receivable of US$547,000 was past due at 31 December 2010 2009: nil but was not impaired.
As at 31 December 2010 other receivables of US$8,194,000 2009: nil were determined to be impaired due to doubt over recoverability of well abandonment expenses from previous field owners incurred under Intervening Period and Decommissioning Liability Agreements note 4.
The carrying value of the Groups trade, joint venture and other receivables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents The carrying value of the Groups cash and cash equivalents is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value.

The share capital comprises only one class of Ordinary share.
Each Ordinary share carries an equal voting right and right to a dividend.
On incorporation, the Company issued and allotted two Ordinary shares of 1.00 each.
On 18 March 2010 the Board approved a 20:1 share split whereby each 1.00 Ordinary share was converted to 20 Ordinary shares of 0.05.

Share-based payment plans On 18 March 2010, the Directors of the Company approved three share schemes for the benefit of Directors and employees, being a Performance Share Plan, a Deferred Bonus Share Plan and a Restricted Share Plan.
No awards under the Performance Share Plan were granted to employees in 2010.
Deferred bonus Share Plan DbSP Directors and selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme.
Participants may be invited to elect or in some cases, be required, to receive a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest Invested Awards.
Following such award, EnQuest will generally grant the participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares Matching Shares.
The awards granted in 2010 will vest 25% on the second anniversary of the date of grant, a further 25% after year three and the final 50% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
The invested awards are fully recognised as an expense in the period to which the bonuses relate.
The costs relating to the matching shares are recognised over the four year vesting period and the fair values of the equity-settled matching shares granted to employees are based on quoted market prices adjusted for the trued up percentage vesting rate of the plan.
Details of the fair values and assumed vesting rates of the DBSP scheme are shown below: Weighted average fair value per Trued up share vesting rate 2010 awards 101p 98% 2009 awards n a n a The following shows the movement in the number of shares held under the DBSP scheme outstanding but not exercisable: 2010 2009 number Number Outstanding at 1 January Granted during the year 390,730 Vested during the year Forfeited during the year Outstanding at 31 December 390,730 Includes invested and matching shares.
The charge recognised in the 2010 statement of comprehensive income in relation to matching share awards amounted to US$72,000 2009: nil.
Restricted Share Plan RSP Under the Restricted Share Plan scheme, employees are granted shares in EnQuest over a discretionary vesting period, which may or may not be, at the direction of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of EnQuest, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
Awards made in 2010 under the RSP will vest over periods between one and five years.
At present there are no performance conditions applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention to introduce them in the future.
The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year are based on quoted market prices adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period.
Details of the fair values and assumed vesting rate of the RSP scheme are shown below: Weighted average fair value per Trued up share vesting rate 2010 awards 104p 98% 2009 awards n a n a The following table shows the movement in the number of shares held under the RSP scheme outstanding but not exercisable: 2010 2009 number Number Outstanding at 1 January Granted during the year 7,926,411 Vested during the year Forfeited during the year Outstanding at 31 December 7,926,411 The charge recognised in the year ended 31 December 2010 amounted to US$2,997,000 2009: nil.

Share-based payment plans continued long-term incentive Plan scheme ltiP Prior to the formation of EnQuest PLC, LNS participated in the Lundin Petroleum Group LTIP scheme which consisted of an annual grant of units that converted into cash payment at vesting.
The cash payment was determined at the end of each vesting period by multiplying the number of units by the share price.
The LTIP had a three year duration whereby the initial grant of units vested equally in three tranches: one third after one year, one third after two years and the final third after three years.
The demerger of LNS from the Lundin Petroleum Group resulted in all LTIP awards vesting due to the change in control, resulting in total costs of US$717,000 for the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: US$608,000.
Share Option programme LNS participated in the Lundin Petroleum Group Share Option programme prior to the formation of EnQuest PLC, whereby warrants were issued to employees enabling them to buy shares in Lundin Petroleum AB.
All incentive warrants issued under this scheme expired by 30 June 2010.

Under the terms of the facility agreement, the Group has the ability to draw loans to a maximum value of US$200,000,000 and utilise Letters of Credit LoC to a maximum aggregate value of US$80,000,000.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at US LIBOR relative to each agreed loan period plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25%, dependent on specified covenant ratios.
A facility non-utilisation commitment fee is payable at 50% of the interest margin.
At 31 December 2010 there were no borrowings under the Groups facility agreement 2009: nil and LoC utilisation of US$74,000,000 2009: nil.
ii Term loan At 31 December 2009, LNS had a term loan under the Lundin Petroleum AB Group term loan facility with BNP Paribas.
On 31 March 2010, in anticipation of the combination of LNS with EnQuest, this term loan was assigned from LNS to Lundin Petroleum BV.

The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs, which are expected to be incurred up to 2030 assuming no further development of the Groups assets.
The liability is discounted at a rate of 5.0% 2009: 5.5 %.
The unwinding of the discount is classified as finance cost note 6.
These provisions have been created based on internal estimates.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning liabilities is likely to depend on the dates when the fields cease to be economically viable.
This in turn depends on future oil prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Risk management and financial instruments Risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits, interest-bearing loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and raise finance for the Groups capital expenditure programme.
The Groups activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with fluctuations in oil price, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
Also presented below is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups financial instruments and to show the impact on profit and shareholders equity, where applicable.
The sensitivity has been prepared for periods ended 31 December 2010 and 2009 using the amounts of debt and other financial assets and liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk oil prices The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in oil prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil.
The Group did not hedge this risk in the years ending 31 December 2010 and 2009.

Risk management and financial instruments continued The following table summarises the impact on the Groups pre-tax profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in the oil price, with all other variables held constant: Pre-tax profit Equity US$10 BblUS$10 Bbl US$10 BblUS$10 Bbl increase decrease increase decrease US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 31 December 2010 69,746 69,746 20,661 33,478 31 December 2009 35,790 35,790 14,810 14,810 During 2010, the Board of EnQuest approved a policy to hedge up to a maximum of 50% of annual oil production.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Group entered in to four zero premium oil price collars for 2011 to hedge, partially, its exposure to fluctuations in oil prices.
Each collar will hedge the price of approximately 1,000,000 barrels of oil in 2011.
These derivative instruments are designated effective cash flow hedges and had a nil fair value at 31 December 2010 2009: nil.
Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the Groups functional currency.
The Group manages this risk by converting US$ receipts at spot rates periodically and as required for payments in other currencies.
Approximately 6% of the Groups sales and 79% of costs are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
The following table summarises the impact on the Groups pre-tax profit and equity due to change in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities of a reasonably possible change in United States dollar exchange rates with respect to different currencies: Pre-tax profit Equity 10% -10% 10% -10% US dollar US dollar US dollar US dollar rate increase rate decrease rate increase rate decrease US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 31 December 2010 22,664 22,664 10,879 10,879 31 December 2009 1,752 1,752 876 876 Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised, international oil and gas operators and at 31 December 2010 there were no trade receivables past due 2009: nil, and one joint venture receivable past due of US$547,000 2009: nil.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had one customer accounting for 97% of outstanding trade and other receivables 2009: one customer, 83% and three joint venture partners accounting for 82% of joint venture receivables 2009: nil.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Cash balances can be invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view to minimising counter-party credit risks.
Liquidity risk The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements on a regular basis relative to its existing bank facilities and the maturity profile of these facilities.
Specifically the Groups policy is to ensure that sufficient liquidity or committed facilities exist within the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the Group can service its debt and adhere to its financial covenants.
Throughout the year and at 31 December 2010 the Group was in compliance with all financial covenant ratios agreed with its bankers.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had US$206,000,000 2009: nil of undrawn committed borrowing facilities available which are due to expire in March 2012 and replacement borrowing facilities are expected to be arranged during 2011.

Risk management and financial instruments continued Capital management The Groups management is committed to delivering and enhancing shareholder value, and building upon the progress made during the current year.
The Board believes that this can best be achieved by reinvesting in the Groups core business and through pursuing selective acquisitions and development opportunities.
In light of the Groups commitment to investment in ongoing production operations development, exploration projects and acquisitions, the Directors do not recommend payment of a dividend at this time.
This is, however, re-assessed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Group seeks to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency whilst also maintaining flexibility for future acquisitions.
The Group keeps under review the costs and access to debt funding to ensure it has an appropriate flexibility.
Note 19 to the financial statements provides further details of the Groups financing activity.
Capital for the Group is equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company, and is in the Group statement of changes in equity on page 57.
The Group monitors capital using the gearing ratio and return on shareholders equity as follows: 2010 2009 us$000 US$000 Loans and borrowings, net A 134,557 Cash and short-term deposits 41,395 7,893 Net debt B 41,395 126,664 Equity attributable to EnQuest PLC shareholders C 882,896 160,200 Profit for the year attributable to EnQuest PLC shareholders D 27,076 7,992 Gross gearing ratio A C n a 84% Net gearing ratio B C n a 79% Shareholders return on investment D C 3% 5% 25.
Post balance sheet events On 11 February 2011 the Group sold its 48.75% interest in the Petisovci project Petisovci in Slovenia in return for 150, 903,958 new Ordinary shares in Ascent Resources plc Ascent, representing a 22.2% equity stake in Ascent.
The Group had acquired its interest in Petisovci through its acquisition of Stratic in November 2010.
As part of the transaction the Group also received a nil-cost option to receive a further 29,686,000 new Ordinary shares in Ascent, subject to certain criteria related to the successful development of Petisovci.
On 23 March 2011 it was announced that supplementary Corporation tax on UK oil and gas production is to be increased from 20 per cent to 32 per cent with effect from 24 March 2011, thereby increasing the combined rate of tax on UK oil and gas production from 50 per cent to 62 per cent on ring fence profits and from 65 per cent to 81 per cent for fields liable to petroleum revenue tax.
The government has stated that the supplementary Corporation tax rate may be reduced back to 20 per cent if oil prices stay low below US$75 per barrel for a sustained period, however it is not clear at this time if this will be incorporated into legislation.
This change in UK tax legislation does not impact the 2010 Group financial results as these changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, however it is likely to have a material effect on the value of the Groups deferred tax liabilities and assets and income tax charge in future reporting periods.
