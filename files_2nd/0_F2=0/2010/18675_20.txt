Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:59 Page 60 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 notes to the financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation 60 These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, including International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement for the parent company.
The financial statements have been prepared in Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
The measurement bases and principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below.
These accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the year to 31 March 2009, as amended to reflect any new Standards, Amendments to Standards and interpretations which are mandatory for the year ended 31 March 2010.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007 requires presentation of a comparative balance sheet as at the beginning of the first comparative period in some circumstances.
Management considers that this is not necessary this year because the March 2008 balance sheet is the same as that previously published.
Status of Adoption of Significant New or Amended IFRS Standards or Interpretations The Group adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations in the year.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007 : IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised 2007 effective 1 January 2009 : IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Revised 2008 effective 1 January 2009 : Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments - Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective 1 January 2009 : Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement - Eligible Hedged Items effective 1 July 2009 : Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Properties - Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property effective 1 January 2009 : Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Improving Disclosures About Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2009 : Embedded Derivatives - Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRIC 9 effective for annual periods ending on or after 30 June 2009 : IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008 effective 1 July 2009 : IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective 1 January 2009 : IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate effective 1 January 2009 : and, IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation effective 1 October 2008.
There has been no material impact as a result of adopting the above other than in the presentation of accounts under the revised requirements of IAS 1 and IFRS 8.
The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued but are not yet effective.
They will be adopted at the point they are effective: IAS 27 amended Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements - Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate: IAS 28 revised 2008 Investments in Associates: IAS 32 amended Financial Instruments - Presentation - Classification of Rights Issues: IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers: and, Improvements to IFRSs April 2009.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Principal accounting policies Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of Helical Bar plc the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings together the Group drawn up to 31 March 2010.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities over which the Group has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies through the exercise of voting rights.
Subsidiaries are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the Group and are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under IFRS the Groups share of the results and of the net assets of the joint ventures are shown in the Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet Balance Sheet respectively.
Under IFRS the Companys cost of investment in joint ventures is shown in the Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:59 Page 61 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Going concern The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Financial Review on pages 31 to 33.
Revenue recognition Rental income - rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Any incentive for lessees to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over the 61 same period.
Sale of goods - assets, such as trading properties, development sites and completed developments, are regarded as sold upon the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
This occurs on exchange of unconditional contracts for the sale of the site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a conditional sale where those conditions are satisfied at completion.
Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets is derived from the fair value of the consideration received in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Construction contracts - where an asset is constructed under a specific contract with a purchaser a pre-sold development the initial sale of the site to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
The construction element of the contract is treated, for the purposes of revenue recognition, as a construction contract in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion which is typically determined by reference to project appraisals, normally supported by independent valuation certificates provided by quantity surveyors.
The Companys principal other responsibility on pre-sold developments is the identification of and agreement of terms with potential tenants of the completed building s. The revenue recognition of this additional component of the funding agreements is considered separately to reflect the substance of the transaction as the rendering of services, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
The amount of revenue recognised is determined by reference to the percentage of the building s that are let.
Investment income - revenue in respect of investment and other income represents investment income, fees and commissions earned on an accruals basis and the fair value of the consideration received receivable on investments held for the short-term.
Dividends are recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment has been established.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Share-based payments The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan.
These payments are discussed in greater detail in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 43 to 50.
The fair value of share-based payments related to employees service are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at the grant date.
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 are recognised in the financial statements.
The Group uses the stochastic valuation model and the resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement Income Statement over the vesting period of the share-based payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, over the vesting period, to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
Depreciation In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment properties.
The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies.
Costs incurred in respect of leasehold improvements to the Groups head office at 11-15 Farm Street, London W1J 5RS are capitalised and held as short-term leasehold improvements.
Leasehold improvements, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Short leasehold improvements 10% or length of lease, if shorter Plant and equipment 25% Taxation The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences of the manner in which Helical expects, at the balance sheet date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:59 Page 62 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reflects the estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the awards at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 62 expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
It is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied: a the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference: and, b it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which dividends are approved.
Investment properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for long-term rental income and for capital appreciation.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction costs, and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value.
These fair values are based on market values as determined by professionally qualified external valuers or are determined by the directors of the Group based on their knowledge of the property.
In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included as gains or losses on revaluation in the Income Statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property is treated as investment property in accordance with IAS 40.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an investment property measured at fair value and is not reclassified.
Interest is capitalised before tax relief until the date of practical completion.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings.
Interest is capitalised from the date of commencement of the development work until date of practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 15.
Goodwill Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired, is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately after acquisition in the Income Statement.
Land, developments and trading properties Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Investments Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the Income Statement.
Upon disposal, accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the Income Statement.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:59 Page 63 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowing and borrowing costs Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of finance and other costs yet to be amortised.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of new developments and investment properties are 63 added to the costs of such properties until the date of completion of the development or investment.
After initial recognition borrowings are carried at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate caps and floors, and forward foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risks arising from its activities.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and forward rates as appropriate.
Any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Further information on the categorisation of financial instruments can be found in note 23.
Leases Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, finance leases of investment property are accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
Exchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item which is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate.
The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to retained earnings in equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges are transferred to the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Net asset values per share Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.
Earnings loss per share Earnings loss per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust Shares held in the Helical Bar Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are shown as a deduction in arriving at equity funds.
Assets, liabilities and reserves of the ESOP are included in the statutory headings to which they relate.
Purchases and sales of own shares increase or decrease the book value of Own shares held in the Balance Sheet.
At each period end the Group assesses and recognises the fair value of Own shares held and accounts for movement between book value and fair value as a reserves transfer.
Use of estimates and judgements To be able to prepare accounts according to generally accepted accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the financial accounts.
These estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:59 Page 64 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may significantly impact on the Groups earnings and financial position are: revenue on construction contracts where the valuation is spread over the construction period using estimates of the final outcome note 3 : valuation of investment properties, where external valuers are used to provide third party valuations note 15 : calculation of deferred tax liabilities, where indexation is used to reduce the provision for deferred tax on revaluation 64 surpluses note 11 : recognition of share-based payments which is dependent upon the estimated number of performance share plan awards that will vest at the end of the performance periods note 31 : calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits will be available in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered note 11 : valuation of the investment in Quotient Bioscience Group Limited, which is based on a valuation method note 18 : valuation of the investment in a property developer which is based on a valuation method note 18 : and, directors valuation of land, development and trading properties include subjective assumptions including the results of future planning decisions and future sales values and timings note 22.
Segmental information The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 April 2009.
IFRS 8 requires the identification of the Groups operating segments which are defined as being discrete components of the Groups operations whose results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to those segments and to assess their performance.
This has not led to a change in the division of operating segments to those disclosed in prior years and the Group continues to divide its business into the following segments: Investment properties, which are owned or leased by the Group for long-term income and for capital appreciation, and Trading properties which are owned or leased with the intention to sell: and, Development properties, which include sites, developments in the course of construction, completed developments available for sale and pre-sold developments.

This final dividend, amounting to 265,000, has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2010, in accordance with IFRS.
Parent company The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own income statement in the financial statements.
Earnings per share The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year end.
Shares held by the ESOP, which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed exercise of all dilutive options.
The earnings loss per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share and the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:59 Page 69 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Reconciliations of the earnings loss and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Accordingly, the basic and diluted losses per share for that year are the same.
Diluted EPRA earnings per share excludes from earnings the IFRS effects of including the gain on sale and revaluation of investment properties net of tax and fair value movement on derivative financial instruments net of tax.

Available-for-sale investments Non-Current Non-Current Current Current Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2009 13,310 13,310 7,684 71 Additions 338 Disposals 10 Fair value adjustments 15 15 2,947 At 31 March 2010 13,325 13,325 10,959 Included in non-current available-for-sale investments is an effective investment of 18% in Quotient Biosciences Group Limited Quotient, a private bioscience company.
The valuation of the investment in Quotient is determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market for the shares.
The valuation for one part of the business is based on the sales price of a similar business.
Due to the difference in the technology involved the sales price is discounted by 60%.
The value of another part of the business is derived from the forecast revenue for the year to 31 March 2011 and a revenue multiple for the business based on the market capitalisation of similar businesses within the biosciences sector.
For the remainder of the business the valuation is derived from the forecast earnings for the year to 31 March 2011 and an earnings multiple for the business based on the market capitalisation of similar businesses within the biosciences sector.
The increase in the valuation of the investment in Quotient is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as is the associated movement in deferred tax.
It is believed that the correct discount factor of one of the parts of the business should be within the range of 50% to 60% based on the differing levels of progress of the technologies.
The discount factor of 60% is deemed to be the most appropriate based on the known technological progress.
However, were the discount factor 50% the value of the investment would be 1,272,000 greater and the shareholder funds would be increased by 916,000.
The revenue multiple is calculated from the sales values of other similar businesses.
The multiple chosen is the average of the range of multiples identified.
Were the earnings multiple at the bottom of the range the value of the investment would be 1,644,000 lower and the shareholder funds would be reduced by 1,184,000.
Were the earnings multiple at the top of the range the value of the investment would be 3,645,000 greater and the shareholder funds would be increased by 2,624,000.
The earnings multiple is calculated from the sales values of other similar businesses.
The multiple chosen is in the average of the range of multiples identified.
Were the earnings multiple at the bottom of the range the value of the investment would be 312,000 lower and the shareholder funds would be reduced by 225,000.
Were the earnings multiple at the top of the range the value of the investment would be 321,000 greater and the shareholder funds would be increased by 231,000.
The gain on sale of investments in 2009 of 1,892,000 was due to the Group selling a tenth of its holding in Quotient.
Included within current available-for-sale investments is an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed-use development and an investment of 20% of the equity of this company.
At the beginning of the year the Group had an entitlement to 10% of the equity of the company and the option to buy additional shares.
During the year this entitlement and option were renegotiated to 20% of the equity without an option to buy additional shares.
The loan was also renegotiated.
The loan and the equity are classed as available-for-sale investments and are held at fair value.
The Group has determined its fair value by considering both the loan and the equity element separately.
The loan element is valued at the fair value of the consideration receivable.
The equity element is given a nil value with the Group valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at nil as they believe this is the most probable outcome.
This nil valuation is derived because the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the companys assets, after the repayment of the loan payable to the Group, would be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
The movement in the fair value of the available-for-sale investments and the associated deferred tax movement are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Financial liabilities are stated in accordance with IAS 32.
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-forsale assets, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are externally measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Both would be classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosure, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Available-for-sale assets, which are described in note 18 are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements, being those not based on observable market data.
There were no transfers between categories in the current or prior year.

Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 13:00 Page 76 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Credit risk Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this risk the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial position, past experience and other factors.
As at 31 March 2010 Helical has total credit risk excluding cash of 63.9m of which 24.3m is available-for-sale assets and 39.6m is loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale assets are analysed in note 18.
76 Of the trade receivables held at 31 March 2010, two amounts of 2.4m and 4.5m were due from the sale of investment properties and were received on 19 April 2010 and 4 May 2010 respectively and a further 2.7m related to rent due from tenants which was received post year-end.
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.
For further information on trade and other receivables, see note 24.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
Helical manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, and through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility.
Management monitors the Groups net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions and the directors regularly monitor the financial institutions that the group uses to ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.
For further information on borrowing facilities, see notes 27 and 28.
The maturity profile of the Groups contracted financial liabilities is as follows: Group Group Company Company 31.3.
The above contracted liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date.
The management believe that these facilities, together with anticipated sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities, mean that Helical can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
Market risk Helical is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value of the investments and accrued development profits.
The Group actively monitors these exposures.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 13:00 Page 77 notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Interest rate risk It is the Groups policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on long-term financing.
Helical does this by using a number of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The purpose of these derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 28.
77 In the year to 31 March 2010, if interest rates had moved by 1%, this would have resulted in the following movement to pre-tax losses and equity due to movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.

Foreign currency exchange risk Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, Helical has exposure to exchange movements on foreign currencies.
Helicals management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk and reviews any requirements to act to minimise these risks.
During the year Helical has entered into currency option contracts in order to reduce its exposure to these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2010 the Group made foreign exchange losses of 1,127,000 resulting from foreign exchange movements related to its Polish operations.
The Groups balance sheet translation exposure is summarised as follows: 31 March 2010 31 March 2009 Euro Zloty US dollars Euro Zloty US dollars 000 000 000 000 000 000 Gross currency assets 48,387 11,508 10,946 54,090 8,409 7,672 Gross currency liabilities 25,399 3,826 29,941 6,562 Net exposure 22,988 7,682 10,946 24,149 1,847 7,672 The group has entered into a fair-value hedge to reduce the effects of foreign exchange translation losses on stock.
Any movement in the fair value of this instrument is shown in the Income Statement as part of the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The Companys balance sheet translation exposure is almost exclusively due to intra-group loans and is summarised as follows: 31 March 2010 31 March 2009 Euro Zloty Euro Zloty 000 000 000 000 Gross currency assets 4,025 14,955 2,596 11,388 Gross currency liabilities Net exposure 4,025 14,955 2,596 11,388 The Groups main currency exposure is to the euro.
The sensitivity of the net assets and profit of the Group to a 10% change in the value of the foreign currencies against sterling is Euro: 2,299,000 March 2009: 2,415,000, Zloty: 768,000 March 2009: 185,000, US dollar: net assets: 788,000 March 2009: 552,000, profit: nil March 2009: nil.
The sensitivity of the net assets and profit of the Company to a 10% change in the value of the foreign currencies against sterling is Euro: 402,000 March 2009: 260,000, Zloty: 1,496,000 March 2009: 1,139,000.
In addition to the above the Group has entered in to a number of currency option contracts to act as cashflow hedges against development contracts in Poland and future expected profits on the development schemes.
Whilst these contracts are designed to minimise foreign exchange risk on these transactions hedge accounting has not been applied and any movement to the fair value of the options is shown in the Income Statement as part of the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
