This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are not met.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.

Segmental analysis IFRS8 Operating Segments has been applied for the first time by the Group in these financial statements.
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three core divisions, Bus, Rail and aviation services, which form the basis of the Groups reportable operating segments as they did previously under IAS14.
Operating segments within those divisions are combined on the basis of their similar long term economic characteristics and similar nature of their products and services, as follows: The Bus division comprises regulated bus operations in London and deregulated operations in the north east, Oxford, the south east, southern England and Norfolk.
The Group also has a 50% investment in a US school bus operation valued at 0.7m which has not traded in the year.
The Rail operation, Govia, is 65% owned by Go-Ahead and 35% by Keolis and comprises three rail franchises: Southern, Southeastern and London Midland.
As disclosed in note 8, the majority of the Groups ground handling and cargo operations were sold on 30 January 2010 and are therefore classified as discontinued operations.
Amounts included in continuing operations for the aviation services segment comprise mainly Meteor and some residual ground handling operations.
Management monitors the operating results of its divisions separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
The operating segments disclosed in the financial statements are the same as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss excluding amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items.
com The following tables present information regarding the Groups reportable segments for the year ended 3 July 2010 and the year ended 27 June 2009.

If all changes had been enacted then for each 1% change our deferred tax asset would reduce by 1.0m and our deferred tax liability would reduce by 2.3m.

Impairment During the year ended 3 July 2010 an impairment review of the aviation services division resulted in the goodwill of Meteor Parking of 18.4m being written down to 2.2m.
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 103 Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 14.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is tested annually for impairment.
The goodwill charge of 1.1m 2009: 2.4m is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill to be impaired annually.
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the Groups business operations.
The carrying value of goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Meteor Parking 2.2 18.4 New Southern Railway 1.0 Metrobus 10.6 6.5 Go South Coast 28.6 28.6 Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1 Plymouth Citybus 13.0 Go-Ahead London 10.5 10.5 Go North East 2.7 0.8 Konectbus 3.6 73.3 67.9 The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cashflow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period.
Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts, using a growth rate of 3.0% which reflects the Directors view of long term growth rates in each business.
The pre-tax cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.1% 2009: 11.0%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash-generating unit of 0.0-2.0% 2009: 0.0-2.0%.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the budget period.
The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff costs and general overheads.
These assumptions are influenced by several internal and external factors.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
We have conducted sensitivity analysis on our calculations and confirmed that there are no likely movement on assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
The cash generating unit with the least headroom is Plymouth City Bus, as expected given it has only recently been acquired.
An increase of 1% of the Groups weighted cost of capital would result in an impairment of 0.9m and a further 1% increase would lead to a further impairment charge of 2.0m.
15. Business combinations Year ended 3 July 2010 On 3 October 2009, London General Transport Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of East Thames Buses from Transport for London TfL for a total cash consideration of 5.0m.
East Thames Buses operated a fleet of approximately 120 vehicles over nine TfL contracted routes.
On 3 October 2009, Metrobus Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of Arrivas bus interest in Horsham for a total cash consideration of 5.0m.
The interests include a fleet of 18 vehicles and 58 employees, and will operate as part of Metrobus Limited which provides bus services in Sussex, Surrey and Kent including regulated services for TfL.
On 1 December 2009, Go-Ahead Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Plymouth Citybus Limited from Plymouth City Council for a cash consideration of 19.0m.
Plymouth Citybus operates a fleet of 175 vehicles and employs approximately 470 employees in the Plymouth area.
On 9 March 2010, Go Ahead Holding Limited also acquired 100% of the share capital of Konectbus Limited which operates a bus fleet of 44 vehicles and employs approximately 70 employees in the Norfolk area.
On 28 March 2010, Go North East Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the group, entered into a contract to acquire the Hexham operations of Arriva plc for a cash consideration and agreed to sell Go North Easts Ashington operations to Arriva.
The operations became effective April 2010.
The combined consideration for these acquisitions was 8.2m.

The goodwill capitalised reflects the access to the markets served by the acquired entities and the potential business synergies that can be achieved upon acquisition.
Management believes that goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value to the growth in respect of customer awareness and an assembled workforce for which the recognition of a discreet intangible asset is not permitted.
From the date of acquisition, in the year ended 3 July 2010, the acquisitions recorded an operating profit of 3.6m to the Group and revenue of 31.5m.
Had the combinations taken place at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that they would have recorded 4.9m of operating profit and 48.7m of revenue to the Group.
This would have resulted in total Group revenue of 2,218.8m, and total operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items of 103.3m Year ended 27 June 2009 There have been no business combinations during the year ended 27 June 2009.
Assets classified as held for sale Assets held for sale, with a carrying amount of 1.7m 2009: 9.7m, represent property, plant and equipment which are currently not used in the business and are now available for sale.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors and management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, and cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Groups activities, namely working capital, fixed asset expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and fuel price risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2010 and 2009, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only purchased for internal benefit.
The main financial risks arising from the Groups activities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Risks arising from fuel derivatives are explained in note 24.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates.
The Boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to 36 months.
During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging.
Excluding fixed rate debt, the Group has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.

Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
At 3 July 2010, the Group had four interest rate swaps totalling 130.0m.
Two of these interest rate swaps fix the interest on part of the variable rate syndicated loan 50.0m was fixed at 2.01% plus margin until December 2011 and 50.0m was fixed at 2.39% plus margin until December 2012.
The remaining two interest rate swaps of 15.0m each are now ineffective.
During the year ended 3 July 2010, these four interest swaps have resulted in a realised loss of 3.0m.
These swaps result in a net fixed rate liability of 3.4m at 3 July 2010.
Hence the adverse risk at year end is a decrease in interest rates.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

Available liquidity as at 3 July 2010 was as follows: 2010 2009 m m Amount drawn down under syndicated loan facility 103.0 239.0 Total available facility 280.0 340.0 Headroom 177.0 101.0 On 24 March 2010, the Group raised a 200m bond of 7.5 years maturing on 29 September 2017.
The level of drawdown and prevailing interest rates are detailed in note 21.
The Groups road passenger vehicles can be financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest over two to five year primary borrowing periods.
This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises.
Foreign currency risk The Group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material.
Should larger foreign currency transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedging the foreign currency exchange risk.
On 26 July 2010, a $10.0m facility was agreed with RBS to ensure dollar investment in our US joint venture is funded by dollar borrowings to provide an effective foreign currency hedge.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash deposits see note 18.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt.
A provision is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cashflows.
The majority of the Groups receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies such as the DfT.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
Risk of exposure to non-return of cash on deposit is managed through a treasury policy of holding deposits with banks rated A or Aa3 or above with at least one of the agencies.
Our treasury policy outlines the maximum level of deposit that can be placed with any one given financial institution.

Adjusted net debt at the year end was 292.3m 2009: 272.3m, equivalent to 1.91x 2009: 1.56x EBITDA in line with the Groups aim to maintain to an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through the cycle.
Operating leases The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This results in 1.2m 2009: 0.4m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of 31.2m 2009: 13.1m.
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees.

Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial instruments carried in the financial statements have been reviewed as at 3 July 2010 and are as follows: Year ended 3 July 2010 Held for trading fair value through profit Total carrying Amortised cost and loss value Fair value m m m m Fuel price derivatives 0.5 0.5 0.5 Interest rate derivatives 3.4 3.4 3.4 Fixed rate debt Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 3.9 13.9 13.9 Year ended 27 June 2009 Held for trading Fair value through profit Total carrying Amortised cost and loss value Fair value m m m m Fuel price derivatives 21.7 21.7 21.7 Interest rate derivatives 0.5 0.5 0.5 Fixed rate debt 24.8 24.8 25.5 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 16.5 16.5 16.5 41.3 21.2 62.5 63.2 The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 18, 20 and 21 is not significantly different to their carrying amount.
The fuel price derivatives and interest rate swaps were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price at the relevant date.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cashflows at prevailing rates.
The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 3 July 2010, the Group has used a level 2 valuation technique to determine the fair value of all financial instruments.
During the year ended 3 July 2010, there were no transfers between valuation levels.
Hedging activities Fuel derivatives The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.
At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place.
For the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years cashflow hedges were placed over 126, 122, 27 and 1 million litres of fuel respectively.
The fair value of the asset or liability has been recognised on the balance sheet.
The value has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices.
As at 3 July 2010 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 109 million litres for the year ending 2 July 2011, representing approximately 97.0% of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus division.
As at 3 July 2010 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years of 105, 13 increased to 28 million litres after 3 July 2010 and 1 million litres respectively.
As at 3 July 2010 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 17 million litres for the year ending 2 July 2011, representing the anticipated fuel usage in London Midland and Southern.
As at 3 July 2010 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2012 and 2013 financial years of 17 and 14 millions litres of rail fuel respectively.
The Groups hedging policy for the target percentage of anticipated bus fuel usage hedged for the next year and subsequent two years, and its current compliance with that policy is as follows: 2011 2012 2013 Percentage to hedge per Group policy 100.0% 50.0% 25.0% Actual percentage hedged 97.0% 93.0% 25.0% 114 www.

During the year ended 3 July 2010, the onerous contract provision in the aviation services division reduced from 1.5m to 0.6m as the expected losses were incurred, and a further onerous contract provision of 1.0m was created in the bus division to cover the costs of operating lease commitments on routes served by articulated buses which are being phased out.
Franchise commitments comprise contractual obligations arising in connection with franchise delivery where the amounts payable are subject to ongoing disputes.
The depot provisions represent ongoing legal actions relating to planning consent issues and are expected to be incurred within five years.
Onerous contracts provisions are expected to be incurred within three years.
Franchise commitment provisions are expected to be incurred within one year.

To support subsidiary companies in their normal course of business, the Group has indemnified certain banks and insurance companies who have issued certain performance bonds and letters of credit.
These bonds are supported by a 65% several guarantee from The Go-Ahead Group plc and 35% several guarantee from Keolis S. A.

The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is 5.4m 2009: 4.9m being the contributions paid and payable.
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared.
The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been recognised in the Groups financial statements according to IAS 19.
Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions paid by that company.
The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS 19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate contributions paid.
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan Some employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan.
These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Contributions to the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The schemes are closed to new entrants, however eligible employees can join the defined contribution section of the The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
Other pension plans During the year, a defined benefit plan was introduced for a small number of employees transferring from East Thames Buses, similarly some transferring employees of Plymouth City Bus have entitlement to a Devon County Council defined benefit plan.
Both schemes are externally funded.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
Both schemes are now closed to new entrants.
Other pension arrangements A small number of employees in aviance have access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements as part of legacy agreements.
The expense recognised for this is 0.1m 2009: 0.3m, being the contributions paid.

The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60% 40% between the franchise holder employee respectively.
The RPS sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes.
In addition to the defined benefit cost, BRASS matching AVC company contributions of 1.2m 2009: 0.9m were paid in the year.
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term.
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted.
On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.

Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the Groups financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise its constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations.
In all other respects the Groups accounting policy is consistent with IAS 19 and the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes.
In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS 1 and departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Groups obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit.
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a franchise adjustment, which is that portion of the deficit or surplus projected to exist at the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund or benefit from.
