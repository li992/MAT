Due to the Companys status as an Investment Trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investments.
c The Company has unrelieved excess management expenses of 10,453,000 2009: 6,043,000.
