NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 18.
Employment cost The group contributes to several defined contribution provident funds.
The provident funds are funded on the money accumulative basis with the members and company having been fixed in the constitutions of the funds.
All the groups employees, other than those directly employed by West African subsidiary companies, are entitled to be covered by the above-mentioned retirement benefit plans.
Retirement benefits for employees employed by West African subsidiary companies are provided by the state social security system to which the company and employees contribute a fixed percentage of payroll costs each month.
GROUP 31 Dec 31 Dec US$000 2010 2009 Total employee benefit cost was as follows: Short term benefits 11 675 11 162 Pension contributions 564 464 Share-based payments 11 843 9 564 Total 24 082 21 190 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS SHARE OPTIONS The fair value of employee services received as consideration for share options equity settled of the company is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
No options were granted during the year.
The key assumptions used in this model for options granted during the year ending 31 December 2009 were as follows: GROUP 31 Dec 31 Dec US$000 Notes 2010 2009 Expected life - 3 years Volatility 18.1 - 59.23% Risk free interest rate - 1.65% Dividend yield - 0% Weighted average share price on grant and valuation date 18.2 - US$56.99 Weighted average exercise price 18.3 - US$56.99 18.1 Volatility is based on the three year historical volatility of the companys shares on each grant date.
18.2 Weighted average share price for the valuation is calculated taking into account the market price on all grant dates.
18.3 The weighted average exercise price is calculated taking into account the exercise price on each grant date.
Please refer to page 92 for details provided on share options, including the number and weighted average exercise price of share options outstanding at the beginning and end of each period, options granted, exercised and lapsed during the period.
18.4 The exercise of the options issued in 2009 is subject to a satisfactory performance level being achieved during the 12 month period prior to the exercise date of each tranche of options.
The minimum performance level to be achieved is defined as level 3 in the companys performance management system.
Similar performance criteria were attached to the options that were issued in previous years.
It is expected that most employees who were awarded share options would achieve a level 3 performance.
More detail is given on page 91 and 92 of the remuneration report in respect of options that were issued, exercised and lapsed during the year.
Employment cost continued MOTO OPTIONS Options over 774 163 ordinary shares were issued in relation to Moto options during the year ending 31 December 2009, as part of the acquisition of the joint venture interest in Moto Goldmines Ltd Moto refer note 29.
The weighted average exercise price of these options as at 15 October 2009 the date of completion of the Moto acquisition was US$56.39 per option.
The fair value of these share options has been calculated as US$20.2 million.
The Black Scholes valuation model was used to determine the fair value of these options.
The table below summarises the information about the options related to the Moto acquisition that were outstanding and exercisable as at 31 December 2010 and 2009: Weighted Weighted average average Number contractual exercise Range of exercise price US$ of shares life years price US$ At 31 December 2010 37.11 - 51.27 1 412 - 51.27 105.16 - 105.16 63 548 - 105.16 64 960 - 103.99 At 31 December 2009 37.11 - 51.27 183 436 0.41 42.82 105.16 - 105.16 121 800 0.30 105.16 64.19 - 80.96 67 079 0.54 77.43 372 315 0.39 69.45 Average US$ price Options 2010 2009 2010 2009 Moto share options At 1 January 69.45 - 372 315 - Granted - 56.39 - 774 163 Exercised 52.09 44.28 249 103 401 848 Lapsed 105.16 - 58 252 - At 31 December 103.99 69.45 64 960 372 315 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS RESTRICTED SHARES Restricted shares issued to directors and management The company operates a restricted share scheme for directors and management.
The exercise of these restricted shares shall be subject to a satisfactory performance level being achieved during the 12 month period prior to the exercise date of each tranche of shares.
The minimum performance level to be achieved is defined as level 3 on the companys performance management system.
The majority of employees to whom restricted shares have been granted are expected to meet this level of performance.
The restricted shares issued to executive directors are subject to a market performance condition.
This has been assessed and has a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The fair value of the restricted shares is based on the share price on the day date of granting and the share based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
The restriction on the shares no dividends received during the vesting period has a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The restricted shares have an exercise price of nil.

Segmental information Operating segments have been identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the groups chief operating decision maker.
The operating segments included in internal reports are determined on the basis of their significance to the group.
In particular, operating mines are reported as separate segments and exploration projects that have significant capitalised expenditure or other fixed assets are also reported separately.
Other parts of the group, including the RAL1 joint venture, are included with corporate and exploration.
The groups chief operating decision maker is considered by management to be the board of directors.
An analysis of the groups business segments, excluding intergroup transactions, is set out below.
Major customers are not identifiable because all gold is sold to an agent.
Financial risk management In the normal course of its operations, the group is exposed to gold price, currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks.
In order to manage these risks, the group may enter into transactions which make use of on-balance sheet derivatives.
The group does not acquire, hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The group has developed a risk management process to facilitate, control and monitor these risks.
The board has approved and monitors this risk management process, inclusive of documented treasury policies, counterpart limits, controlling and reporting structures.
CONTROLLING RISk IN THE GROUP The treasury committee is responsible for risk management activities within the group.
The treasury committee reviews and recommends to the board all treasury counterparts, limits, instruments and hedge strategies.
At least two members of the treasury committee need to be present for a decision to be made one of whom needs to be an executive director.
The treasury committee is only permitted to invest with institutions with investment ratings of AAor higher.
Two of the banks with which the group is holding deposits are rated below the AAstipulated per the groups policy but above an A rating.
Both these banks have secured government backing in one form or another.
In the light of the government support for these two banks it was decided to continue to hold a portion of the groups deposits limited to 10% per institution with them.
The treasury committee is responsible for managing investment, gold price, currency, liquidity and credit risk.
The treasury committee monitors adherence to treasury risk management policy and counterpart limits and provides regular reports.
The financial risk management objectives of the group are defined as follows: safeguarding the group core earnings stream from its major assets through the effective control and management of gold price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk: effective and efficient usage of credit facilities in both the short and long term through the adoption of reliable liquidity management planning and procedures: ensuring that investment and hedging transactions are undertaken with creditworthy counterparts: and ensuring that all contracts and agreements related to risk management activities are coordinated, consistently throughout the group and comply where necessary with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements.
Refer to pages 79 and 80 for details on the groups risk factors included in the corporate governance report.
Financial risk management continued FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE RISk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily euro, South African rand and Communaut Financire Africaine franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into derivatives to manage these currency risks.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and sells at market spot prices.
Gold sales are disclosed in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
These derivatives may establish a fixed price for a portion of future production while the group maintains the ability to benefit from increases in the spot gold price for the majority of future gold production.
The group is also exposed to fluctuations in the price of consumables, such as fuel, steel, rubber, cyanide and lime, mainly due to changes in the price of oil, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates.

Interest rAte AnD lIquIDIty rIsk Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short term cash investments and interest payable on financing activities including long term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The group generally enters into variable interest bearing borrowings.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source financing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
The group typically holds financial investments with an average maturity of 30 days to ensure adequate liquidity.
The maturity of all financial liabilities is set out in note 21.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from the proceeds of its gold sales and is required to fund working capital requirements.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve market-related returns while minimising risks.
The group is able to actively source financing at competitive rates.
The counterparts are financial and banking institutions of good credit standing.
Management believes that the working capital resources, by way of internal sources and banking facilities, are sufficient to fund the groups currently foreseeable future business requirements.

Financial risk management continued ConCentration of Credit risk The groups derivative financial instruments and cash balances do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable as set out in the accounting policy note for receivables.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in Mali.
The gold produced is sold to the largest accredited gold refinery in the world.
Credit risk is further managed by regularly reviewing the financial statements of the refinery.
The group is further not exposed to significant credit risk, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
Included in receivables is US$14 million 2009: US$40.9 million refer to note 7 relating to indirect taxes owing to Morila and Loulo by the State of Mali, which are denominated in FCFA.
Receivables also include advances to MDM totalling US$10.7 million net of impairment provision 2009: US$11.0 million refer to note 25.
Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position, plus net debt.

Non-GAAP information Randgold Resources has identified certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the performance of the business.
As the measures are not defined under IFRS they may not be directly comparable with other companies adjusted measures.
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but management has included them as these are considered to be important comparables and key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
These measures are explained further below: Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are non-GAAP measures.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce are calculated using guidance issued by the Gold Institute.
The Gold Institute was a non-profit industry association comprising leading gold producers, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers.
This institute has now been incorporated into the National Mining Association.
The guidance was first issued in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institutes guidance, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from deferred stripping where relevant and royalties.
Under the companys accounting policies, there are no transfers to and from deferred stripping.
Total cash costs per ounce are calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute guidance, by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures or an indicator of our performance.
The data does not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore amounts presented may not be comparable to data presented by gold producers who do not follow the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
In particular depreciation, amortisation and share-based payments would be included in a measure of total costs of producing gold under IFRS, but are not included in total cash costs under the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
Furthermore, while the Gold Institute has provided a definition for the calculation of total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce, the calculation of these numbers may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, Randgold believes that total cash costs per ounce are useful indicators to investors and management of a mining companys performance as it provides an indication of a companys profitability and efficiency, the trends in cash costs as the companys operations mature, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are calculated by deducting royalties from total cash costs.
Cash operating costs per ounce are calculated by dividing cash operating costs by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Randgold previously calculated total cash costs per ounce by dividing total cash costs, as defined above, by ounces produced, as permitted under the guidance.
Randgold previously calculated cash operating costs per ounce by dividing cash operating costs, as defined above, by ounces produced.
Given the significant difference between ounces produced and ounces sold in the year, together with the fact that, under the definitions above, costs relating to ounces produced but not sold are recognised in the quarter when the ounces are actually sold, the company deemed it appropriate to change the bases for these calculations by dividing total costs and cash operating costs by ounces sold, as this would better match the timing of costs and sales recorded.
Historically, this change would not have resulted in materially different cash costs per ounce, however, in the current year the difference was significant and consequently the numbers have been restated on this basis.
Gold sales is a non-GAAP measure.
It represents the sales of gold at spot and the gains losses on hedge contracts which have been delivered into at the designated maturity date.
It excludes gains losses on hedge contracts which have been rolled forward to match future sales.
This adjustment is considered appropriate because no cash is received paid in respect of these contracts.
Profit from mining activity is calculated by subtracting total cash costs from gold sales for all periods presented.

Significant uncertainties relating to transactions with a contractor The directors believe that the group is entitled to recover US$57.6 million from MDM Ferroman Pty Ltd MDM in liquidation, the contractor which was responsible for construction of the Loulo mine the project until the main construction contract was taken back on 30 December 2005.
This comprises payments totalling US$32 million which have been capitalised as part of the cost of the project, US$15.2 million in respect of damages arising from the delayed completion of the project, and advances of US$10.7 million - net of an impairment provision of US$1.3 million - 2009: US$11.0 million - net of an impairment provision of US$1.1 million included in receivables.
Recoveries of US$1.2 million are held in trust.
Of this latter amount, US$7 million is secured by performance bonds and the remainder is secured by various personal guarantees and other assets.
As part of the groups efforts to recoup the monies owed, MDM was put into liquidation on 1 February 2006.
This resulted in a South African Companies Act Section 417 investigation into the business and the financial activities of MDM, its affiliated companies and their directors.
This investigation was concluded in June 2007 and the liquidators have released a statement of MDMs assets and liabilities.
In light of this the directors believe that the group will be able to recover the US$10.7 million included in receivables.
However, this is dependent on the amounts which can be recovered from the performance bonds, personal guarantees and other assets provided as security.
Any shortfall is expected to be recovered from any free residue accruing to the insolvent estate.
The recovery process has commenced with summons being issued against creditors who received payment from MDM in terms of the South African Insolvency and Companies Acts and against the insurance company which issued the performance bonds.
Of the original amount US$1.6 million has been recovered so far and the process of recovery is ongoing and expected to be complete by the end of 2011.
The aggregate amount which will ultimately be recovered cannot presently be determined.
Recovery of the other US$47.2 million is dependent on the extent to which the groups claim is accepted by the liquidators and the amount in the free residue.
The ultimate outcome of this claim cannot be determined at present.
The financial statements do not reflect any adjustment to the cost of the Loulo development that may arise from this claim, or any additional income that may arise from the claim for damages, or any charge that may arise from MDMs inability to settle amounts that are determined to be payable by MDM to the group in respect of the Loulo development.

Acquisition of joint venture interest in Moto Goldmines Limited There were negligible adjustments to the acquisition date fair values as a result of the settlement of acquisition related costs, but due to the immaterial nature of the final settlement of these costs, a revised acquisition table is not presented.
There have been no other adjustments to the acquisition date fair value assumptions.
On 15 October 2009 the acquisition of 100% of Moto Goldmines Limited Moto, as announced on 5 August 2009, was completed.
Randgold and AngloGold Ashanti Limited, through their indirect jointly owned subsidiary Kibali Jersey Ltd, now control Moto, having acquired all 111 085 009 outstanding Moto common shares.
The acquisition had the following effect on the groups assets and liabilities: GROUP Fair Book values Fair US$000 value adjustments values Fair value of Moto net assets acquired at acquisition date: Cash and cash equivalents 9 440 9 440 Property, plant and equipment 1 024 1 024 Mineral properties 226 170 8 707 234 877 Trade and other receivables 3 851 3 851 Available-for-sale financial assets 3 150 3 150 Inventory 11 11 Trade and other payables 3 911 8 707 12 618 Non-controlling interest 46 060 46 060 193 675 - 193 675 Randgold on acquisition share of net assets acquired 50% 96 838 Fair value of the net consideration paid by Randgold 327 824 Less Randgold share of fair value of Moto assets and liabilities acquired 96 838 Excess of fair value of consideration paid over fair value of net assets acquired 230 986 The fair value adjustments arise in respect of under-provided taxation liabilities and payments due to the Democratic Republic of Congo government.
The excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired of US$231 million is wholly attributed to mineral properties as it represents the gold resources of the Kibali gold project: Moto owns a 70% interest in the Kibali project and therefore following the acquisition of the joint venture interest in Moto, Randgold had an indirect 35% interest in Kibali Goldmines SPRL which holds the licence in respect of the Kibali gold project.
Randgolds 50% share in Moto has been proportionately consolidated from 15 October 2009 and a 15% non-controlling interest in Kibali Goldmines SPRL recognised.
No deferred taxation liability arose on the transaction, as the transaction constituted an acquisition of a joint venture interest and not a business combination.

The cash consideration paid was US$113.6 million and therefore each company paid US$56.8 million for their respective 10% shareholding.
Randgold also incurred US$1.2 million of transaction costs bringing the total consideration for Randgolds 10% interest to US$58 million.
The fair value of the net assets acquired was US$14.5 million.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired of US$43.5 million has been wholly attributed to mineral properties as it represents the increase in Randgolds interest in the gold resources of the Kibali gold project.
As a result of this further acquisition Randgold has a 45% interest in Kibali Goldmines SPRL: 35% is held indirectly through its joint venture interest in Moto Goldmines Limited and 10% indirectly through its joint venture interest in Kibali Jersey Ltd. As a result the non-controlling interest recognised in respect of Kibali Goldmines SPRL has been reduced from 15% to 5% from 22 December 2009.
