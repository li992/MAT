A A b bo ou ut t t th he e a ar rt tiis st t five ta Pacovsk, whose vibrant work illustrates this report, has long been one of Eastern Europes K leading artists.
At least 100 national and international exhibitions have been devoted to Pacovsks paintings and collages.
1frontcover 2page13 Born in 1928 in Prague, she studied at the Prague Academy of Applied Arts.
It was there that she became imbued with the spirit of the European Avant Garde, with artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Joan Mir and the Bauhaus movement exerting particular influence.
That heritage is immediately identifiable in her distinctively graphic use of colour.
Pacovsk says: White and black are included in the colour spectrum but for me 4page103and99 they are colours and mean maximum contrast.
And maximum contrast is maximum beauty.
The two other colours usually present in her work are a raw, fiery red and vivid green, along with pink, yellow and blue.
The result is a bracing connection with the senses.
It is like music, she has said.
Each individual tone is beautiful by itself and in certain groupings we create new dimensions, 3page14 harmony, disharmony, symphonies, operas and books.
It is in the last that Pacovsk has perhaps achieved her greatest recognition, as well as being widely imitated.
She refuses to be constrained by the two-dimensional nature of print.
A book is architecture for me, she has said.
It is a 5pages8and9 given sealed space into which I compose painted, written, cut and empty pages.
She says she started producing books for her own children and over the past four decades she has written and illustrated more than 60 titles, winning the Hans Christian Andersen prize for literature for young people in 1992.
Her works have been translated into many languages including English, German, Italian, French, Portuguese, Danish, Japanese and Chinese.
