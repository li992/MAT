Supply agreements includes Logistics customer relationships and exclusive supply arrangements in Cuba and Morocco, all acquired under the purchase of Altadis.
The 41 million reduction in goodwill in 2010 reflects an adjustment in respect of the Reemtsma acquisition and is more fully described in note 29.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of acquired intangible assets are treated as reconciling items between reported operating profit and adjusted operating profit.
The adjustment comprises the amortisation and impairment charges in respect of goodwill, trademarks and supply agreements.
119 Strategy Performance Governance Financials Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Intangible Assets continued Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs.
For the Tobacco business these are based on the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is set out below.
2010 2009 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with million Goodwill indefinite lives Goodwill indefinite lives European Union 6,356 127 6,742 135 Americas 1,828 105 1,783 103 Rest of the World 2,885 341 3,071 360 Cuban cigar joint ventures 289 250 284 246 Tobacco 11,358 823 11,880 844 Logistics 1,697 1,795 13,055 823 13,675 844 Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 mainly EU and Rest of the World, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 Americas and Altadis in 2008 all CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections derived from three year financial plans which are approved by the Board annually.
The three year plans are based on detailed bottom up market by market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line.
These forecasts reflect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding, inter alia, anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, anticipated consumer uptrading and downtrading, changes in consumer preferences and other changes in product mix.
These estimates and assumptions are based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost inflation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate of three per cent per annum.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the CGUs.
Pre-tax discount rates ranged from 8.7 per cent to 11.3 per cent.
Growth rates used Initial Long-term 1 2 growth rate growth rate European Union 2.0% 3.0% Americas 8.5% 3.0% Rest of the World 12.5% 3.0% Cuban cigar joint ventures 4.7% 3.0% Logistics 2.0% 3.0% 1 Weighted average compound annual growth rate used for first three years in value-in-use calculations.
2 Weighted average compound annual growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial three years.
The impairment test for Americas indicated headroom of 250 million and that an increase in the discount rate of 70 basis points from 11.3 per cent, a reduction of 290 basis points in the initial growth rate, or an 80 basis point reduction in the long-term growth rate would result in an impairment.
In addition to the initial growth rates shown above applied to cash flows arising in existing markets, the valuation of the Cuban cigar joint ventures includes assumptions about the timing and extent of cash flows from entry to new markets.
The impairment test for the Cuban cigar joint ventures indicated headroom of 60 million and that an increase of 60 basis points in the discount rate from 10.0 per cent or a reduction of 9 per cent or more in the value of overall cash flows would result in an impairment.
We do not consider any reasonable movement in other assumptions relating to the Americas and the Cuban cigar business joint ventures would result in an impairment.
For the Tobacco business in the European Union and the Rest of the World, and for Logistics, any reasonable movement in the assumptions of the impairment test would not result in an impairment.
No impairment charges have been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill and intangible assets.
