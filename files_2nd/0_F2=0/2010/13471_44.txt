Australian Corporations Act summary of ASIC relief Pursuant to section 340 of the Corporations Act 2001 Corporations Act, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued an order dated 22 December 2010 that granted relief to Rio Tinto Limited from certain requirements of the Corporations Act in relation to the Companys financial statements and associated reports.
The order essentially continues the relief that has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since the formation of the Groups Dual Listed Companies DLC structure in 1995.
The order applied to Rio Tinto Limiteds financial reporting obligations for financial years and half-years ending between 31 December 2010 and 30 June 2014 inclusive.
In essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to prepare consolidated financial statements covering only itself and its controlled entities, the order allows Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity.
In addition, those consolidated financial statements are to be prepared: in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union EU IFRS rather than the Australian Accounting Standards AAS except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report, and in accordance with United Kingdom financial reporting obligations generally: on the basis that the transitional provisions of International Financial Reporting Standard 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards should be applied using the combined financial statements previously prepared for Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom, under which the DLC merger between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc was accounted for using me rger, rather than acquisition, accounting reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited nor Rio Tinto plc was acquired by, or is controlled by, the other, and meaning that the existing carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and liabilities at the time of the DLC merger were used to measure those assets and liabilities at formation : on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single company with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company : and with a reconciliation, from EU IFRS to AAS, of the following amounts: consolidated profit for the financial year, total consolidated income for the financial year and total consolidated equity at the end of the financial year see page 162.
Those consolidated financial statements must also be audited in relation to their compliance with relevant United Kingdom and Australian requirements.
Rio Tinto Limited must also prepare a Directors report which satisfies the content requirements of the Corporations Act applied on the basis that the consolidated entity for those purposes is the Group, except that the order allows Rio Tinto Limited to prepare a separate Remuneration report that is merely cross-referenced in the Directors report, instead of including in the Directors report the Remuneration report otherwise required by the Corporations Act.
The separate Remuneration report see pages 128 to 155 must include all the information required to be included in a Remuneration report under the Corporations Act.
Rio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act including timing requirements in relation to those consolidated financial statements including any concise financial statements, the Auditors report and the Directors report.
The separate Remuneration report is also required to be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission at the same time as the consolidated financial statements, and Rio Tinto Limited must not distribute or make available the Remuneration report without the consolidated financial statements and Directors report.
At the Companys AGM, it is required to allow shareholders to vote on a non binding resolution to adopt the Remuneration report, on the same basis as would otherwise be required for a Remuneration report under the Corporations Act.
Rio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities.
Rio Tinto Limited is also no longer required to prepare and lodge parent entity financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year consistent with recent changes made to the Corporations Act.
However, consistent with those changes, Rio Tinto Limited must in accordance with the Corporations Act include in the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as a note, various parent entity information regarding Rio Tinto Limited including in relation to assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, profit and loss, income, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and contractual commitments prepared in accordance with AAS see page 246.
