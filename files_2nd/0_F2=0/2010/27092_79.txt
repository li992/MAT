21 Recoverable VAT In 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment management fees should be exempt from VAT.
Since then, HMRC has accepted the Managers repayment claims for the periods from 1990 to 1996 and from 2000 to 2007.
During the year ended 30 April 2009 the Company received a reimbursement of 2,902,000 in this regard of which 1,164,000 had been recognised in the year to 30 April 2008, with the balance of 1,738,000 being recognised in that year together with interest thereon of 1,078,000.
A case has been recently brought against HMRC to seek to recover the amounts relating to the intervening period, 1997 to 2000, together with interest on a compound basis.
The Companys Auditors, PwC, have provided services in connection with this case for a fee of 35,000 see note 4.
Additional fees may become payable to PwC in the event of a successful outcome to the case.
No amounts have been accrued in this regard.
The potential recoveries of VAT and interest would be a significant multiple to the potential additional fees payable to PwC.
No VAT or related interest recovery has been accrued or recognised as a contingent asset as the outcome of the case is expected to remain uncertain for several years.
22 Related Party Transactions The Directors fees for the year are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 26.

23 Financial Instruments As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to secure its investment objective of capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have sufficient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that cause short term variation in the Companys net assets and could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent reduction in the Companys net assets rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager both assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitors the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9.
Details of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date are shown on page 44.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
