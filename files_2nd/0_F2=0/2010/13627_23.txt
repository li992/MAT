Group Business Review Governance Financial Statements Information ROTORK P. L. C. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 85 Notes to the Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 a.
Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
Notes a to k relate to the Company rather than the Group.
Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK GAAP.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under FRS 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Group includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 and has not disclosed transactions with entities which are subsidiaries of the Group.
The Group financial statements contain financial instrument disclosures which comply with FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 not to present separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company continues to account for intragroup cross guarantees under FRS 12.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments Investments are measured at cost less any provision for impairment and adjusted where equity settled share-based payments are made to the subsidiary Companys employees.
They comprise investments in subsidiary companies.
Depreciation and amortisation Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less than 50 years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 10% to 33% Post-retirement benefits The Company participates in a Group wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement benefits, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Classification of preference shares Following the adoption of the presentation elements of FRS 25, Financial instruments, the cumulative redeemable preference shares issued by the Company are classified as long-term debt.
The preference dividends are charged within interest payable.
Share-based payments The Company has adopted FRS 20 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Groups policy under IFRS 2.
This policy is shown in note 1 to the Group financial statements.

Accounting policies continued Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full, without discounting, on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law, except for the items explained below.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the assets or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit those earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Personnel expenses in the Company Profit and Loss Account 2010 2009 Wages and salaries including bonus and incentive plans 1,594 1,449 Social security costs 304 206 Pension costs 192 264 Share-based payments 235 263 2,325 2,182 There are seven 2009: seven employees of Rotork p. l. c. plus the four 2009: four executive directors.
The personnel costs accounted for within the Company include the full costs of the employees and the Group Finance Director but not the full costs of other executive directors.
Half of the salary costs of the Group Chief Executive are reported within the Company but the balance of the costs and those of the other two executive directors are reported within the subsidiary where they are based as this approximates to the basis on which their time is split.
Share-based payments The share-based payment charge relates to employees of the Company participating in the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The disclosures required under FRS 20 can be found in note 24 to the Group Financial Statements.
The table below sets out the movement of share options under the LTIP for employees of the Company.
The weighted average remaining life of awards outstanding at the year end is one year.
