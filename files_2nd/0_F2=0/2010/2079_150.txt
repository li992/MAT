5 Long-term incentives LTI continued FY2010 LTI granted in December 2009 The following table shows the LTI awards determined by the Remuneration Committee as part of Total Remuneration for FY2010 and provided as an award of Performance Shares in December 2009 to drive long-term performance of the Group over a five-year period with comparative data showing December 2008 LTI awards.
FY2011 awards are yet to be determined.
Approval for an allocation of Performance Shares for the CEO will be sought from shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meetings and all FY2011 LTIP awards for members of the GMC will be notified to shareholders when provided in December 2010.
The Expected Value of the LTI awards as calculated by Kepler Associates, takes the performance hurdle into account along with other factors as described in the table above.
The Expected Value is used to represent the forecast remuneration outcomes from the LTIP for the GMC members.
The number and value of Performance Shares which vested with executives during FY2010 is shown in section 6.4.
The December 2009 LTI grants will not provide any value to the executives until at least August 2014.
In order for any benefit to be obtained by the executives from the Performance Shares, the relative five-year TSR performance hurdle must be achieved over the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2014, and the individual must remain employed by the Group unless they leave the Group in specific circumstances as described in the table above.
Non-statutory table: LTI awards shown below are included in the table in section 6.4.
2, but this table shows the Expected Value of the awards as described above in the currency in which they were determined, which is in US dollars unless otherwise noted rather than amortising the US dollar accounting value of each award over the relevant performance and service periods as per accounting standards.

The Expected Value for each executive therefore reflects the number of Performance Shares allocated, the entity over which they apply and the relevant exchange rates where applicable.
2 December 2009 Expected Values are calculated by multiplying the closing share price on the grant date being A$40.65 for BHP Billiton Limited shares and 19.06 for BHP Billiton Plc shares by the Expected Value multiple of 31 per cent as determined by Kepler Associates, converted to US dollars on the allocation date.
3 The maximum award is an Expected Value of 200 per cent of base salary for the relevant year as set out in the previous section.
4 As the purpose of this table is to show allocations which are part of annual Total Remuneration, the December 2008 amounts shown for Andrew Mackenzie do not include an additional 100,839 Performance Shares provided to him in relation to the commencement of his employment with BHP Billiton, reflecting securities from his previous employer which he relinquished on resignation.
Details of those Performance Shares and other awards provided on commencement are provided in section 6.4.

on the basis of pre-tax gross salary.
For other members of the GMC, the minimum requirement is 200 per cent of i. e. two times after-tax base salary.
The value of the securities for the purposes of the policy is the face value of the underlying shares.
All of the members of the GMC currently hold sufficient securities to meet the requirements.
Under the policy, employees are not required to meet the holding requirement before awards are allocated to them, but if they are not holding the required number of shares at the time of exercise of an award, then they will be prohibited from selling all of the underlying shares on exercise.
GMC members are also not allowed to hedge or otherwise protect the value of unvested securities and must receive consent from BHP Billiton to hedge any vested securities as set out in more detail in section 6.5.
