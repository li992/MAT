The group used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of the TSR element of the 2010, 2009 and 2008 CPP, MTPP, and EDIP plans, and in 2009 and 2008 for the PSP plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plans the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against our principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historic dividends, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the actual value of share-based payments made to recipients, which are determined by the remuneration committee according to established criteria.
