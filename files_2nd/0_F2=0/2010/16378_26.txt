Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 97 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management Uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets: impact on Treasury To cope with the continuing uncertainty in the financial markets, we maintained a cautious funding strategy.
Liquidity management: We have run a cash balance during most of 2010, resulting from a strong cash delivery of the business, proceeds from bond issuances in 2009 and disposal proceeds: We have invested this cash conservatively with safe counterparties at short maturities up to six months.
Counterparty exposures: We regularly reviewed and tightened counterparty limits.
Banking exposures were actively monitored on a daily basis.
Unilever benefits from collateral agreements with our principal banks see also page 100 based on which banks need to deposit securities and or cash as collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
Bank facility renewal: Our bank facilities are renewed annually.
On 31 December 2010 we had US $6,050 million of undrawn committed facilities.
For further details, seeLiquidity risk section below.
Treasury risk management Unilever manages a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and counterparty risks.
Currency risks Because of Unilevers broad operational reach, it is subject to risks from changes in foreign currency values that could affect earnings.
As a practical matter, it is not feasible to fully hedge these fluctuations.
In order to manage currency exposures, operating companies are required to manage trading and financial foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits.
This is achieved primarily through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Regional groups monitor compliance with this requirement.
At the end of 2010, there was no material exposure from companies holding assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency.
In addition, as Unilever conducts business in many foreign currencies but publishes its financial statements and measures its performance in euros, it is subject to exchange risk due to the effects that exchange rate movements have on the translation of the underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
Unilever aims to minimise its foreign exchange exposure in operating companies by borrowing in the local currency, except where inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or local market conditions.
For those countries that in the view of management have a substantial re-translation risk, Unilever may decide on a case-by-case basis, taking into account amongst other factors the impact on the income statement, to hedge such net investments.
This is achieved through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts on which hedge accounting isapplied.
Nevertheless, from time to time, currency revaluations on unhedged investments will trigger exchange translation movements in the balance sheet.
Interest rate risks Unilever has an interest rate management approach aimed at achieving an optimal balance between fixed and floating rate interest rate exposures on expected net debt gross borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents for the next five years.
The objective of this approach is to minimise annual interest costs and to reduce volatility.
This is achieved by issuing fixed rate long-term debt and by modifying the interest rate exposure of debt and cash positions through the use of interest rate swaps.
At the end of 2010, interest rates were fixed on approximately 66% of the projected net of cash and financial liability positions for 2011 and 63% for 2012 compared with 95% for 2010 and 75% for 2011 at the end of 2009.
Liquidity risk A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine our credit rating and overall investor confidence and could restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
Operational cash flow provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities and enhance shareholder return.
Unilever manages the liquidity requirements by the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
Unilever maintains access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition to this, Unilever has committed credit facilities in place to support its commercial paper programmes and for general corporate purposes.
During 2010 we did not utilise the committed facilities.
Unilever had US $6,050 million of undrawn committed facilities on 31 December 2010 as follows: revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities of in aggregate US $5,495 million 2009: US $5,285 million out of which US $5,495 million 2009:US$5,285 million with a 364-day term out: and 364-day bilateral money market commitments of in aggregate US $555 million 2009: US $765 million, under which the underwriting banks agree, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for notes with maturities of up to three years.
As part of the regular annual process these facilities are to be renewed in 2011.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 99 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Credit risk on banks and received collateral Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with banks like cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
To reduce the credit risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited group of banks that have secure credit ratings.
Per bank, individual risk limits are set based on its financial position, credit ratings, past experience and other factors.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
The carrying amount of financial assets best represents the Groups exposure of credit risk at the reporting date without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.
To reduce the credit exposures, netting agreements are in place with Unilevers principal banks that allow Unilever, in case of a default, to net assets and liabilities across transactions.
To further reduce Unilevers creditexposures, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal banks based on which they need to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2010 the collateral received by Unilever amounted to58 million 2009: 208 million, of which 38 million 2009: 14 million was cash and the fair value of the bond securities amounted to 20 million 2009: 194 million.
Although contractually Unilever has the right to sell or re-pledge thecollateral, it has no intention to do so.
As a consequence, the non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in our balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments The Group has an established system of control in place covering all derivative financial instruments: including guidelines, exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting, that is subject to periodic review by internal audit.
These instruments areused for hedging purposes.
Hedge accounting principles are described in note 1 on page 78.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
In the assessment of hedge effectiveness the credit risk element on the underlying hedged item has been excluded.
The Group uses the following types of hedges: cash flow hedges used to hedge the risk on future foreign currency cash flows, floating interest rate cash flows, and the price risk on future purchases of raw materials: fair value hedges used to convert the fixed interest rate on financial liabilities into a floating interest rate: net investment hedges used to hedge the investment value of our foreign subsidiaries: and derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied.
Details of the various types of hedges are given below.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts represent the gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts at the year-end forward exchange rates.
The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows.
Cash flow hedges The fair values of derivatives hedging the risk on future foreign currency cash flows, floating interest rate cash flows and the price risk onfuturepurchases of raw materials amount to 35 million 2009: 10 million of which 59 million relates to commodity contracts 2009:7million, 14 million to foreign exchange contracts 2009: 19 million and 9 million to interest rate derivatives 2009: 2 million.
Ofthetotalfair value of 35 million 2009: 10 million, 45 million is due within one year 2009: 12 million.
The following table shows the amounts of cash flows that are designated as hedged items in the cash flow hedge relations: million million million million million million million Due Due Due Due Due Due within between between between between after 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 3 years 3 and 4 years 4 and 5 years 5 years Total 2010 Foreign exchange cash inflows 844 844 Foreign exchange cash outflows 411 411 Interest rate cash flows 27 37 51 51 88 254 Commodity contracts cash flows 317 317 2009 Foreign exchange cash inflows 797 797 Foreign exchange cash outflows 304 304 Interest rate cash flows 9 9 9 17 44 Commodity contracts cash flows 125 125 Fair value hedges The fair values of derivatives hedging the fair value interest rate risk on fixed rate debt at 31 December 2010 amounted to 114 million 2009:92million which is included under other financial assets.

100 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial statements 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued The impact of exchange rate movements on the fair value of forward exchange contracts used to hedge net investments is recognised in reserves.
Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied This relates to derivatives that hedge a balance sheet item.
Both the derivative and hedged item revalue through profit or loss.
This also relates tocertain commodity derivatives that are entered into for risk management purposes but that cannot be brought under hedge accounting due tothe strict requirements in IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The following table shows the fair value of derivatives outstanding at year end for which hedge accounting is not applied.

Sensitivity to not applying hedge accounting Derivatives have to be reported at fair value.
Those derivatives used for cash flow hedging and net investment hedging for which we do not apply hedge accounting will cause volatility in the income statement.
Such derivatives did not have a material impact on the 2010 income statement.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, Unilever has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet specific requirements set out in the standard: no material embedded derivatives have been identified.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of financial assets and financial liabilities.
All trade andother receivables and trade payables and other liabilities have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and currency profiles in note 14 on pages 96 to 97, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair value, because of their short-term nature.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate thefair values: Cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature.
The fair value of unquoted available-for-sale assets is based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates and statistical modelling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.
The fair values and the carrying amounts of all other listed investments included in financial assets and preference shares included in financial liabilities are based on their market values.
The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value.
Non-listed bonds and other loans are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties.
Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity forward contracts.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.
In the balance sheet the value of bonds and other loans is shown at amortised cost unless thebonds are part of an effective fair value hedge accounting relationship, in which case the value of the bond is adjusted with the market valueof the related derivative.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments: Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs: Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.

All commodity forward contracts and futures hedge future purchases of raw materials.
Settlement of these contracts will be in cash or by physical delivery.
Those contracts that will be settled in cash are reported in the balance sheet at fair value and, to the extent that they are considered as an effective hedge under IAS 39, fairvalue movements are recognised in the cash flow reserve.
Capital management The Groups financial strategy provides the financial flexibility to meet strategic and day-to-day needs.
The key elements of the financial strategy are: appropriate access to equity and debt markets: sufficient flexibility for acquisitions that we fund out of current cash flows: A A1 long-term credit rating: A1 P1 short-term credit rating: sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the constraints above.
For the A1 P1 short-term credit rating and for the A A1 long-term credit rating, Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.
This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.
The capital structure of Unilever is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Unilever will take appropriate steps in order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, the capital structure.
Annually the overall funding plan is presented to the Board for approval.
Unilever is not subject to covenants in any of its significant financing agreements.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 103 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 15 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Income statement sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates The values of debt, investments and related hedging instruments, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities holding them, are subject to exchange rate movements.
The translation risk on the foreign exchange receivables and payables is excluded from this sensitivity analysis as the risk is considered to be immaterial because positions will remain within prescribed limits see currency risks on page 98.
The remaining unhedged foreign exchange positions at 31 December 2010 amount to 52 million 2009: 2 million.
A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a 5 million movement in the income statement 2009: 0.2 million, based on a linear calculation of our exposure.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in interest rate Interest rate risks are presented by way of sensitivity analysis.
As described on page 98, Unilever has an interest rate management approach aimed at optimising net interest cost and reducing volatility in the income statement.
As part of this approach, part of the financial assets and financial liabilities have fixed interest rates and are no longer exposed to changes in the floating rates.
The remaining floating part of our financial assets and financial liabilities see interest rate profile tables on pages 96 for the assets and 97 for the liabilities is exposed to changes in the floating interest rates.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the income statement to a reasonably possible one percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis.
Sensitivity to a reasonably possible one percentage point increase in floating rates as at 31 December million million 2010 2009 Financial assets 109 92 Financial liabilities 126 91 A reasonably possible one percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on a full-year basis would have the equal but opposite effect.
Net investment hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in foreign exchange rates To reduce the re-translation risk of Unilevers investments in foreign subsidiaries, Unilever uses net investment hedges.
The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements and changes in these fair values are recognised directly in equity and will offset the re-translation impact of the related subsidiary.
At 31 December 2010 the nominal value of these net investment hedges amounted to 4.4 billion 2009: 4.9 billion mainly consisting of US $ contracts.
Areasonably possible 10% strengthening of the euro against all other currencies would lead to a fair value movement of 395 million 2009: 486 million.
A reasonably possible 10% weakening of the euro against all other currencies would have the equal but opposite effect.
Thefair value movement would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the re-translation of the book equity of the foreign subsidiary.
Cash flow hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates Unilever uses on a limited scale both interest rate and forex cash flow hedges.
The fair values of these instruments are subject to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Because of the limited use of these instruments and the amount of Unilevers equity, possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates will not lead to fair value movements that will have a material impact on Unilevers equity.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1,515 million and tax credits amounting to 78 million available for offset against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 1,109 million and tax credits of 78 million, asit is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 524 million of state and federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2030.
Other deductible temporary differences of 83 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,633 million 2009: 1,319 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Legal provisions are comprised of many claims, including a 110 million provision regarding potential competition law infringement in the European Union in relation to consumer detergents.
Further information is given in note 25 on page 116.
The provision for disputed indirect taxes is comprised of a number of small disputed items.
The largest elements of the provision relate to disputes with the Brazilian authorities.
Because of the nature of the disputes, the timing of the utilisation of the provisions and any associated cash outflows is uncertain.
The majority of the disputed items attract an interest charge.
No individual item within the other provisions balance is significant.
Unilever expects that the issues relating to these restructuring, legal and other provisions will be substantively resolved over the next five years.
106 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial statements 19 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In many countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Themajority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities isgoverned by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees orequivalent and their composition.
Exposure to risks Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 15,974 million and 18,044 million respectively are held on the Groups balance sheet as at 31December 2010.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates, inflation and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits in these schemes, and could prompt the need for the Group to make additional pension contributions, or to reduce pension contributions, in the future.
The key assumptions used to value our pension liabilities are set out below and on pages 108 and 109.
Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The pension funds also have a proportion of assets invested in property, bonds, hedge funds and cash.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and hedge funds.
The aim is to provide a highquality, well-diversified, risk-controlled vehicle.
Assumptions With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal defined benefit plans which cover approximately 95% of total pension liabilities and the plans providing other post-employment benefits, and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: million million 1% point 1% point increase decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components 1 1 Effect on total benefit obligation 18 17 The expected rates of return on plan assets were determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The years of life expectancy for 2010 above have been translated from the following tables: i UK: the year of use S1 series all pensioners S1AP tables have been adopted, which are based on the experience of UK pension schemes over the period 2000-2006.
Scaling factors are applied reflecting the experience of our pension funds appropriate to the members gender and status.
Future improvements in longevity have been allowed for in line with the 2009 CMI Core Projections and a 1% pa long-term improvement rate.
ii the Netherlands: the Dutch Actuarial Societys AG Prognosetafel 2010 2060 table is used with correction factors to allow for the typically longer life expectancy of pension fund members relative to the general population.
This table has an in-built allowance for future improvements in longevity.
iii United States: the table RP-2000 with projected mortality improvement using Projection Scale AA from 2000 to 2017 for annuitants and to2025 for non-annuitants.
iv Germany: fund specific tables are used which broadly equate to Heubeck 1998 with a scaling factor of 75%.
Assumptions for the remaining defined benefit plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the countries where they aresituated.

Liabilities of 150 million were transferred from the UK unfunded plan to the funded plan in 2009.
This followed the payment to the UK funded plan in 2008 in expectation of a transfer in 2009 and 2010.
During 2008 some previously unfunded liabilities were funded utilising existing surpluses.
As a consequence of this the liabilities of 24 million were moved from unfunded to funded in the table above for 2008.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 109 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 19 Pensions and similar obligations continued In 2010, agreement was reached with local insurers to externally insure most of our existing Swedish pension obligation.
Consequently, 150 million liabilities were considered settled and removed from the table above.
The remaining liability in Sweden of 6million is included inunfunded plans.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 50 million 0.3% of total plan assets and 37 million 0.3% of total plan assets at31December 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to 14 million and 12 million at 31December 2010 and 2009 respectively.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benefits Trust amounting to 128 million 2009: 129 million to fund pension and similar obligations in the US see also note 11 on page 91.

b The share-based compensation credit relates to the reversal of the non-cash charge recorded against operating profit in respect of the fair value of share options and awards granted to employees.
c As part of the review of Unilevers corporate structure, and in the light of the constitutional and operational arrangements which enable Unilever N. V. and Unilever PLC to operate as nearly as practicable as a single company, the Directors have been authorised to take any action necessary or desirable in order to ensure that the ratio of the dividend generating capacity of PLC to that of NV does not differ substantially from the ratio of the dividend entitlement of ordinary shareholders in PLC to that of ordinary shareholders in NV.
In 2008 shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland were transferred to 100% NV ownership.
In addition, shareholdings in Canada and Indonesia were re-aligned between NV and PLC.
In 2009 there were no significant changes in group structure.
In 2010 shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Poland were transferred to 100% PLC ownership.
In addition, further re-alignments of shareholdings, mainly in Turkey, were made between NV and PLC intermediate holding companies.

Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and services.
They do not include commitments for capital expenditure, which are reported in note 10 on page 89.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there isa chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.
The Group does not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will result in a material loss.
Contingent liabilities arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2010 was some 228 million 2009: 205 million.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 115 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Unilever Group 25 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued Legal proceedings Details of significant outstanding legal proceedings and ongoing regulatory investigations are as follows: Competition investigations As previously reported, in June 2008 the European Commission initiated an investigation into potential competition law infringements in the European Union in relation to consumer detergents.
While the investigation is ongoing, Unilever has concluded that it is appropriate to take aprovision of 110 million.
In addition and as previously reported, Unilever is involved in a number of other ongoing investigations by national competition authorities in a number of European countries including Greece, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
These investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets.
Provisions have been made to the extent appropriate.
It is Unilevers policy to co-operate fully with the competition authorities in the context of all ongoing investigations.
In addition, Unilever reinforces and enhances its internal competition law compliance procedures on an ongoing basis.
Tax case Brazil During 2004 in Brazil, and in common with many other businesses operating in that country, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice ofinfringement from the Federal Revenue Service.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The dispute is in court and if upheld, will result in a tax payment relating to years from 2001 to the present day.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
We believe that the likelihood of a successful challenge by the tax authorities is remote, however, there can be no guarantee of success in court.

These acquisition-related costs are presented within RDI in calculating underlying operating profit.
Since acquisition, the Personal Care business has contributed 43 million to Group revenue and 8 million to Group operating profit.
If the personal care business acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, Group revenue would have been 754 million and Group operating profit would have been 118 million.

120 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial statements 29 Share-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2010, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
Starting in 2007, performance share awards and restricted stock awards were made under the Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP, exceptinNorth America where awards were made under the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 61 to 67 and those forkeymanagement personnel shown in note 4 on page 84.
No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2008, 2009 or 2010 under theUnilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of theshare-based compensation plans.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using option pricing models and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of share-based compensation plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, andforall plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
The actual remuneration cost charged in each period is shown below, and relates almost wholly to equity settled plans: million million million Income statement charge 2010 2009 2008 Performance share plans 120 166 97 a Other plans 24 29 28 144 195 125 a The Group also provides a Share Matching Plan no awards after 2011, an All-Employee Share Option Plan, a TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan noawards after 2006 and an Executive Option Plan no awards after 2005.
Performance Share Plans In 2007 we introduced the Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP.
The provisions of this plan are comparable with the GPSP, with the same performance conditions of underlying sales growth and ungeared free cash flow for middle management, and the additional target based on TSRranking for senior executives.
Starting in 2008, awards made to GSIP participants normally vest at a level between 0% and 200%.
Starting in2010, GSIP performance conditions changed to underlying sales growth, underlying operating margin improvement and cumulative operating cash flow for middle management, and the additional target based on TSR ranking for senior executives.
2010 GSIP performance conditions apply to GSIP awards made in 2009 with respect to 2010 and 2011 performance years.
Monte Carlo simulation is used to value the TSR component of the awards.
North America managers participate in the North America Performance Share Programme NA PSP no awards after 2010, that awards Unilever shares ifNorth America company performance conditions are met over a three-year period.
The amount to be paid to the company by participants to obtainthe shares at vesting is zero.
Performance conditions for 2010 NA PSP awards are the same as GSIP performance conditions.
The Global Performance Share Plan GPSP was introduced in 2005.
Under this plan, managers were awarded conditional shares which vest threeyears later at a level between 0% and 150% for middle management or 200% for senior executives.
The GPSP performance conditions formiddle management were achievement of underlying sales growth and ungeared free cash flow targets over a three-year period.
For senior executives, in addition to these two conditions, there was an additional target based on TSR ranking in comparison with a peer group over the three-year period see description on page 63 and 64.
