Provisions i Decommissioning costs 2010 2009 2008 $m $m $m At 1 January 223.5 194.0 269.9 New provisions and changes in estimates 55.5 6.6 18.8 Disposal of subsidiaries note 26 2.2 70.3 Decommissioning payments 10.3 2.0 0.4 Unwinding of discount note 5 13.3 14.7 18.8 Currency translation adjustment 3.4 12.4 42.8 At 31 December 278.6 223.5 194.0 The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, African and Asian oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2035.
During 2010 a review of all decommissioning estimates was undertaken by an independent specialist and the 2010 financial statements now include estimates in accordance with this study.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
