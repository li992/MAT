SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2010 63 7 Pension costs The charge for pension costs comprises: For the For the For the For the year ended year ended year ended year ended 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2010 2010 2009 2009 Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 Defined benefit schemes 322 696 Money purchase schemes 832 771 510 1,467 The Group does not participate in a SVG Group pension scheme.
Costs in respect of defined benefit schemes relate to payments due to the Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the Scheme in respect of four former employees of SVG Advisers Limited SVGA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, that were seconded from Schroder Investment Management Limited.
SVGA and the Schemes trustees, taking advice from the independent actuaries, agree the contributions.
In accordance with IAS 19, the Groups contributions to the Scheme are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme on the basis that the Group isunable to readily identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Scheme at the balance sheet date as there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligations, plan assets and costs to the Group.
Further details of the Scheme can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts of Schroders plc.
In particular, the Scheme had 305 active members in the defined benefit section at 31 December 2009 and the accounts of Schroders plc disclosed a net pension deficit in respect of the Scheme of 41.1 million, calculated under IAS 19.
During the year the Group paid 0.4million to Schroders in respect of SVG Advisers share of the Scheme deficits up to 31 December 2008, and wrote back to the income statement the difference between this and the amount accrued in 2009.
Whilst the Group does not expect to make further payments under this scheme, if the deficit increases, the Group may be required to make further payments.
The Group believes there is too much uncertainty to reliably estimate any further such payments.

During the year ended 31 December 2010, gains on investments amounted to 351.2 million 2009: gains of 51.3 million for the Group and 350.9 million 2009: gains of 50.8 million for the Company.
As detailed in note 30, the Company had agreed that it should focus its investments mainly on Permira funds.
As such, and given that our largest exposures currently are to Permira funds see notes 3 and 31, we expect that the performance of the Company will be largely dependent on the performance of the Permira funds in which we invest.
