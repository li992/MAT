2 In May 2010, the Group redeemed certain subordinated debt securities and equity preference shares in exchange for cash or senior debt.
The exchanges involving instruments classified as liabilities all met the criteria in IFRS for treatment as the extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Gains on these exchanges and on the redemption of securities classified as liabilities for cash, totalling 553 million were credited to profit or loss.
No amounts have been recognised in profit or loss in relation to the redemption of securities classified as equity in the Group financial statements.
The difference between the consideration and the carrying value for these securities amounting to 651 million has been recorded in equity.
A similar series of exchange and tender offers completed in April 2009 and resulted in a gain of 3,790 million being credited to profit or loss and 829 million being recorded in equity.
3 Measured as the change in fair value from movements in the period in the credit risk premium payable by the Group.
