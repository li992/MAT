Warning to Shareholders We are aware that some shareholders may have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based organisations who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be extremely persistent and extremely persuasive.
Shareholders are therefore advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice or offers to buy shares at a discount.
Please note that it is most unlikely that either the Company or the Companys Registrar, Capita Registrars, would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders.
Any such calls would only ever relate to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never in respect of investment advice.
If you are in any doubt about the veracity of an unsolicited telephone call, please call either the Company Secretary or the Registrar at the numbers provided on pages 16 and 52 of this Report.
