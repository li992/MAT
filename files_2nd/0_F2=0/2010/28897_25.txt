GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs as follows: 2010 2009 m m UK 52 52 International 359 256 Emerging Markets 239 200 When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cashflows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which do not exceed the long term average past growth rate for the insurance business in which the CGU operates.
A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Group Audit Committee.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Discount rates used are within a range of 9% to 15% 2009: 8% to 14%, are pre tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used in 2010 are within a range of 2% to 5% 2009: 1% to 4%.

There was another strong contribution from International, particularly Swedish Personal lines and Motor and General Liability in Canada, while in the UK, positive run off is primarily driven by Commercial Property, Liability and Legacy.
The adverse development of 31m in the 2009 accident year includes the 25m reserve strengthening for bodily injury in the UK, of which 22m relates to Commercial Motor, the action taken to exit a number of unprofitable UK Motor schemes and continued remediation in Italy.
The total discounting at the end of 2010, net of reinsurance, is 660m representing a decrease of 27m in the year.
In the UK and Scandinavia certain long tail liabilities are settled by an annuity and the discounted value of these annuities is shown separately.

A deferred tax asset of 109m 2009: 41m has been recognised in respect of losses and unused tax credits.
In addition, the Group recognised 69m 2009: 64m in respect of other deferred tax reliefs.
These are included within other temporary differences at 31 December 2010.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 1,390m 2009: 1,428m tax losses and unused tax credits of 5m 2009: 11m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 152m 2009: 115m which will expire between 2011 and 2027.
Other tax losses and unused credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group does not recognise deferred tax on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit any such earnings to the UK in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental tax liability.
The temporary difference in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries is 841m 2009: 748m.

The liabilities arising under the ADC contract comprise an insurance component and a deposit component.
The liability arising under the insurance component of 0.1bn represents the timing risk on the settlement of those liabilities.
The financial liability arising under the deposit component is offset by the value of funds held in a trust fund whose trust deed only permits the trust fund assets to be used to settle amounts due under the ADC.
The value of the funds held in trust at 31 December 2010 is 0.3bn and the value of the liability of the deposit component is 0.3bn.
The insurance component is accounted for within insurance contract liabilities and the deposit component, offset by the value of the funds held in the trust account, is recognised under other liabilities.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes, and has other post retirement obligations.
Defined contribution pension schemes Costs of 55m 2009: 49m were recognised in respect of defined contribution schemes by the Group.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 12m 2009: 9m were paid to this scheme during 2010 and are included in the costs shown above.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2010, when the scheme funding rate was 112% 2009: 113%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held mainly in separate trustee administered funds.
In April 2002, the primary UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants and in 2005, following discussions with the Trustees and consultation with the members, the UK defined benefit schemes were altered from providing benefits on a final salary basis to benefits on a revalued average salary basis with effect from 1 January 2006.
Under the new benefit formula, the accrued benefits of current active members are based on salaries at the date of change and will increase in line with inflation each year limited to 5% in any year up to their retirement date.
Benefits earned in each year from 1 January 2006 are based on salaries in that year and are revalued up to retirement.
In addition to these changes, the 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new members has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder scheme.
During 2009 the Group entered into arrangements that insured 55% of the retirement obligations relating to pensions in payment in the two main UK schemes.
The arrangements comprise of assets and interest rate swaps combined with an insurance contract that provide for the full payment of the pensions in return for the actual investment return on a segregated portfolio of assets held by the pension funds at the inception of the arrangement.
The pension schemes continue to benefit from the assets held in the portfolio and retain the obligation to meet the insured pension obligations.
The assets and pension obligations are therefore not derecognised in the financial statements and an asset representing the recovery of the insured pension obligations and a liability to pay the investment return on the portfolio of assets to the insurer are recognised.
During 2010 changes were made to the benefit structure of the three main UK schemes.
Changes affected future accrual from 1 March 2010 onwards.
Accrual rates were reduced: the retirement age was increased: revaluation was subject to a cap of 2.5%: a cap was applied to the salary used for the defined benefit schemes and the schemes contracted back in to the State scheme.
Employees were entitled to join the Stakeholder Pension scheme for earnings above the cap.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2010 were 23% and 22% of pensionable salaries 2009: 23% and 22%.
Additional contributions totalling 45m 2009: 45m were made to the schemes, in accordance with the plan to reduce their funding deficits.
Expected contributions to pension and post retirement benefit schemes for the year ending 31 December 2011 are approximately 52m, including a further 37m of additional contributions, following the funding valuation in March 2009.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances.
Benefits are generally payable for life.

The expected return on schemes assets are determined for each asset class by considering both market conditions at the beginning of the reporting period and any expectations for longer term changes in current returns.
All returns are net of investment expenses.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
At the funding valuation in March 2009, the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the SAPS Light Normal base table with percentage adjustments to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
The next funding valuation is not due until 2012.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for by using 80% males and 60% females of the long cohort improvements.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 27.5 2009: 27.5 years males and 28.1 2009: 28.1 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future expected lifetime from age 60 of 28.3 2009: 28.2 years males and 28.7 2009: 28.6 years females.
Commutation Each of the UK defined benefit pension schemes has changed its rules to allow for increased commutation following A day in April 2006.
In 2009 the commutation factors were broadly cost neutral i. e. when valued on the IAS 19 basis, the amount of cash taken is approximately equal to the value of the pension being given up.
The Group therefore made no allowance for commutation in the accounting valuation.
In 2010, the Group followed the funding valuation assumptions, and an allowance was made for future commutation using the current commutation factors.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, the assumed inflation rate and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
A 0.1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 48m 2009: 49m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate assumption would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 44m 2009: 43m.
An increase of one year in life expectancy would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by approximately 65m 2009: 68m.
The Group has no material exposure to the effect of changes in medical costs.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 | RSA | 129 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 27.
SHARE BASED COMPENSATION The Group has four types of share based payment plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Sharesave Plan SAYE, the Sharebuild Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.

Awards have been made each year since 2006 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus : in addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are held in trust for three years.
Compulsory Deferred Shares awards are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to Voluntary and Compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares up to a maximum of 2.5:1 and these are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
130 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to Compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to Voluntary Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Performance Shares and Restricted Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Further information on the LTIP can be found in the remuneration report within the corporate governance section.
Further disclosures in respect of the SAYE and Sharebuild schemes have not been made on the grounds that the schemes are immaterial to the Group.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The Group designates certain forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against the net investment in designated subsidiaries to reduce the foreign exchange risk exposure.
On designation, the interest element is separated from the forward exchange rate and is excluded from the hedge relationship.
Effectiveness of the hedge is then measured using the spot rate, which is also the exchange rate used when measuring the net investment in the designated subsidiaries.
The fair value of the hedging instruments at 31 December 2010 is a liability of 39m 2009: 9m.
The hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement during 2010 is nil 2009: nil.
Further information on derivatives, including those designated as hedging instruments, can be found in the risk management section.

On 23 September 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of 123 Money Limited in Ireland.
In addition, a number of business combinations were completed in Canada during the period.
The acquisitions increase the Groups insurance activity in each of the countries.
The total consideration paid was 146m and goodwill of 104m arose on these acquisitions.
Provisional fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed: m Investments 32 Intangible assets excluding goodwill 40 Other assets 74 Cash and cash equivalents 34 Insurance contract liabilities 85 Other liabilities 53 Net assets acquired 42 Cash consideration 120 Deferred consideration 15 Equity issued as consideration 11 Total consideration paid 146 Goodwill on acquisitions in 2010 104 Goodwill arising from purchases in earlier years 24 Goodwill on acquisitions 128 The goodwill arising from purchases in earlier years consists of the revision of the valuation of contingent consideration on acquisitions prior to 2009.
The aggregate fair value of the contingent liabilities recognised in the business combinations is less than 1m.
The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes premiums and insurance balances receivable of 51m, a reduction of 2m on their nominal value to account for balances that are expected to be uncollectable.
The total consideration for the business combinations is subject to agreement with the vendors of the valuation of certain assets and liabilities.
The outcome of these arrangements could increase the aggregate consideration by 2m.
Deferred consideration includes consideration which is contingent on the financial performance of the acquired business.
The fair value of this consideration is 11m, with the minimum possible payment being nil and the maximum possible payment being 23m.
Equity consideration was issued by a subsidiary of the Group on acquisition of Al Ahlia Insurance Company SAOC.
The fair value of the shares issued as consideration was determined by an independent market valuation.
Acquisition related costs for acquisitions concluded during the period included in other operating expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 amounted to 3m.
On acquisition of Sveland Sakfrskring AB, the Group recognised 1m of non controlling interests.
The non controlling interest was measured as the proportionate share in the identifiable acquired net assets.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 | RSA | 133 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2010, Group net written premiums and fee income for the year would have increased by 62m and the Groups profit after tax would have increased by 2m.
The total net written premiums and fee income of the acquired entities since the acquisition dates included in the Groups net written premiums and fee income for the year is 28m.
The total profit after tax of the acquired entities since the acquisition dates included in the Groups profit for the period is nil.
The goodwill shown above arose from the premium paid for strengthening the Groups market position in targeted business segments and acquiring the skilled workforce to drive future profitability in those segments.
Goodwill also represents the future cost saving from expected synergies and economies of scale from central costs and the benefits of enhancing distribution channels.
Of the total goodwill recognised, 43m is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Due to the timing of acquisitions the valuations disclosed above are provisional pending the completion of the review of valuation of certain assets and liabilities, in particular the actuarial review of insurance contract liabilities and the determination of the fair value of intangible assets.
Disposal of subsidiaries Disposals completed during the period resulted in a loss to the Group of 1m.
The principal disposal was that of British Engine Insurance Limited, which was classified as held for sale at the previous year end, at a loss of less than 1m.

The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes premiums and insurance balances receivable of 23m, there has been no deduction for amounts expected to be uncollectable.
Acquisition related costs included in other operating expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 amounted to 3m.
The goodwill shown above arises from the premium paid to strengthen the Groups Commercial proposition in Canada by adding further technical expertise, geographic diversification and product breadth.
Goodwill is further derived from the value of the workforce acquired, the growth from new customers and the significant anticipated synergies from reinsurance, capital and expense savings on integration into the Group.
134 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The goodwill recognised on this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
