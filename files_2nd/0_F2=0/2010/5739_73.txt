RISK MANAGEMENT Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may raise capital from shareholders or restructure its borrowings.
In March 2011, the Group placed 23,438,000 new ordinary shares to institutional investors in a private placing Note 35.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of its gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as debt divided by equity.
Debt represents total borrowings including current and noncurrent borrowings as shown in the statement of financial position, less cash and cash equivalents.
Equity represents equity as shown in the statement of financial position.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2010 and 2009 were as follows: As at 31 December 2010 2009 Note $000 $000 Total borrowings 27 1,712 47,906 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 24 56,297 34,280 Total net debt 8,391 32,568 Total equity 408,016 383,813 Total capital 399,625 351,245 Gearing ratio 2.1% 9.3% The decrease in gearing ratio is in line with the Groups strategy to keep debt at comfortable, sustainable levels.
Under the terms of its loan agreement, the Group is subject to four financial covenants and a number of general covenants.
Two of the financial covenants are tested annually from December 2010, with the remaining two tested on a rolling 12 month basis from June 2012.
The Group has complied with these covenants during 2010.

Commodity price risk The Groups operating results are affected by changes in world oil prices which are dependent on general and specific market conditions.
A decrease in oil prices generally has a negative impact on the Groups operating results and vice-versa.
The Group manages the exposure to commodity prices risk by optimising its core activities in order to achieve stable margins.
The Group has not entered into any hedging arrangements in respect of its commodity price exposures.
A decrease in oil prices of 10% would have lead to decrease in profit for the year ended 31 December 2010 of $6,102 thousand 2009: $1,434 thousand.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings and short-term bank deposits.
The Groups borrowings are exposed to interest rate risk.
As the Group has no significant short-term bank deposits, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
If the interest rate had increased by 100 base points at 31 December 2010, after-tax profit would have been $400 thousand lower 2009: $1 thousand lower.
Since the Group does not hold any financial instruments revalued through equity, the effect of any changes in interest rate on equity would be the same as on posttax profit.
Short-term bank deposits bear no significant interest rate risk due to short maturity.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from default.
The Group only transacts with entities that demonstrate strong financial ability or rated the equivalent of investment grade.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the management for each customer individually.
The Groups credit risk principally arises from cash and cash equivalents and from credit exposures of its customers relating to outstanding trade and other receivables.
Cash is placed in financial institutions which are considered at time of deposit to have minimal risk of default.
