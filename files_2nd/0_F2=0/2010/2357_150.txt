The fair value measurement of the Groups available for sale financial assets include management assumptions of future house price inflation, and therefore the fair value measurement includes inputs which are necessarily not based on observable market data.
Other financial liabilities represent an estimated payment dependent on the growth of the Lloyds Bank House Price Index, from October 2010 to March 2014.
This was carried at a fair value of 2,686,000 2009: nil.

Financial instruments Fair values There is no material difference between the carrying value of financial instruments shown in the balance sheet and their fair value.
Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.

The liability is based on a future discounted cash flow for a nominal value tracking the index until March 2014.
Available for sale financial assets The Group determines the fair value of its available for sale financial assets through estimation of the present value of expected future cash flows.
Cash flows are assessed taking into account expectations of the timing of redemption, future house price movement and the risks of default.
An instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate is used to determine present value via discounted cash flow modelling.
