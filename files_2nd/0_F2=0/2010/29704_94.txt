A more detailed analysis of the maturity profile of the Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and gross-settled derivatives based on contractual undiscounted cash flows and year-end exchange rates is shown below.
Gross settled derivatives are calculated based on the spot prices at the year-end.
Financial liabilities maturity The maturity groupings are based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date.
When a counterparty has a choice of when the amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the Group can be required to pay.
For loan facility drawdowns this will be within three months, although the amounts will be available to be re-drawn, subject to compliance with loan covenants.
For the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that the outstanding loan amount will remain drawn until the quarter-end prior to the expiry date of the facility, i. e. 31 December 2012.
Financial assets maturity Analysis of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss into maturity groupings is based on the long-term nature of these assets and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that no distributions or realisations will occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Beyond that it is extremely difficult to judge the precise size or timing of such cash flows.
It is, however, a requirement under IFRS 7 to disclose such an analysis and therefore a breakdown is provided in the following table for illustrative purposes only.
It is emphasised that the analysis is provided purely to comply with accounting standards.
It is not a forecast and should not be construed as such.
It is based on broad assumptions, further details of which are provided below the table.
For other assets, the analysis into maturity groupings is based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date or if earlier, the expected date the assets will be realised.
