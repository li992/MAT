iii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk movements may affect the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings and the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multi-currency loan facility.
The Group, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates when the financial instrument is due for repayment 2010 2009 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Bank loans 24,910 24,910 24,194 24,194 Bank overdrafts 5,910 5,910 17,799 17,799 30,820 30,820 41,993 41,993 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rates change.
The Group has little exposure to interest rates as the majority of financial assets are equity shares which do not pay interest.
Therefore, the Groups total income and equity is not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances or paid on bank overdrafts respectively is approximately 0.15% and 1.25% per annum 2009: 0.53% and 1.25% per annum.
