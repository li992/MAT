Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders Notes to the Company Financial Statements C1 Accounting policies DSG international plc has historically prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices UK GAAP.
As permitted by Section 395 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected to present its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
Accordingly the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS.
The transition date to IFRS for the Company was 3 May 2008 the Transition Date, being the start of the period of comparative information.
IFRS 1, First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take advantage of certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS and make certain elections in the transition period.
The Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries at the amounts stated under UK GAAP as at the transition date to IFRS.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the current and preceding periods.
After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections, the directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

b Investments Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
c Post-retirement benefits It is not practical to allocate the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit section of the pension scheme to the Company on a consistent and reasonable basis.

120 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders C12 Post-retirement benefits The Company maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
The last valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2007, using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
A further actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2010 is currently underway, however, its results are not expected to be available until early 2011.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section showed the value of assets to be sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of IAS 19 showed a gross pension deficit before deferred tax of 263.5 million 2009 148.8 million and 2008 51.0 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 21 to the Group financial statements.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to all eligible employees.

Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Fixed rate cash and cash equivalents relate to money market deposits as shown in note C7.
Fixed rate borrowings comprise the unhedged part of the Bonds.
Floating rate borrowings include bank overdrafts and fixed rate bonds after taking into account the effect of interest rates swaps entered into by the Company and drawings under the 400 million sterling committed facility.
The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts in 2008 09 approximated 3.7%.
Further details on fixed and floating rate borrowings are shown in notes 17 and 22 to the Group financial statements.
122 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in interest rates on derivative financial instruments and certain monetary items.
The sensitivity analysis reflects the position as at 1 May 2010 and 2 May 2009, respectively, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in interest rates affect the Companys loss before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.
The Companys principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR.
The following sensitivity analysis shows a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant and the corresponding decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on profit before tax and equity of 6.7 million 2008 09 a 10.9 million negative effect on profit before tax and equity.
Assumptions used in calculating the sensitivity analysis are set out in note 22 e to the Group financial statements.

124 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders C16 Principal subsidiary undertakings The directors consider that to give full particulars of all Group undertakings would lead to a statement of excessive length.
A full list of Group undertakings is attached to the latest annual return.
The following information relates to those subsidiary undertakings, all of which are engaged in retail activities, whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the directors, principally affect the consolidated financial statements of the Group at 1 May 2010: DSG international Holdings Limited UK El-Giganten AS Denmark DSG Retail Ireland Limited Ireland Elkjp Nordic AS Norway DSG Retail Limited UK Gigantti OY Finland DSGi South-East Europe A. E. V. E. Greece 99.2% PIXmania S. A. S. France 76.9% Electro World s. r. o. Czech Republic PC City Spain S. A. U. Spain ElectroWorld I five Dis Ticaret AS Turkey 60% UniEuro S. p. A.

C17 Financial information under International Financial Reporting Standards The key differences between UK GAAP and IFRS affecting the Companys accounting policies are set out below.
While this is not a comprehensive summary of all differences between UK GAAP and IFRS, other differences would have no effect or no significant effect on the net loss or shareholders funds of the Company.
The Companys loss after tax for the period ended 2 May 2009 and shareholders funds as at 2 May 2009 and 3 May 2008 are unaffected by the change.
a Presentation of financial statements The primary financial statements are presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements as revised in 2007.
Although similar, such a presentation differs from its UK GAAP equivalent.
The statement of changes in equity, which was previously presented as a note under UK GAAP, is now presented as a primary statement.
IAS 1 requires a statement of cash flows to be presented.
This was not previously required under UK GAAP.
b Reclassifications The following reflects the key presentational changes to the balance sheet.
Such changes have no effect on either net assets or profits going forwards.
Under UK GAAP, specific definitions exist for cash at bank and short term investments.
Under IFRS, a new category described as cash and cash equivalents replaces the UK GAAP equivalent of cash at bank and in hand.
The definition of cash and cash equivalents results in a reclassification of certain amounts from short term investments into cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax assets are split into amounts falling due within one year and amounts falling due after more than one year.
IFRS requires all deferred tax asset balances to be shown as non-current.
C18 Post balance sheet events On 12 May 2010, the Company signed a new revolving credit facility agreement the New Facility for 360 million.
The New Facility will come into effect by 15 August 2010 at which time it will replace the Companys existing 400 million Facility.
The terms and covenants attaching to the New Facility are substantially the same as that for the 400 million Facility except that the guarantee structure comprises UK and Irish companies only, thereby aligning it more closely to the Bonds.
At the earliest, the New Facility will mature on 15 August 2012 and the Company has the ability to extend the New Facility to 15 August 2013 in the event that it raises additional finance of a minimum of 100 million by November 2011.
Further details of the New Facility are shown in notes 17 and 22 to the Group financial statements.
