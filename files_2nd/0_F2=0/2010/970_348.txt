Both earnings measures are further explained below.
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: US$ million unless otherwise stated 2010 2009 earnings Basic earnings, being profit for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 6,544 2,425 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares Interest payable on convertible bond net of tax 49 32 Unwinding of discount on convertible bond net of tax 47 28 Diluted earnings 6,640 2,485 number of shares million 1 Basic number of ordinary shares outstanding 1,206 1,202 2 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares Share options and awards 14 11 Convertible bond 61 40 1 Diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding 1,281 1,253 1 Basic and diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding represent the weighted average for the year.
The average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes shares held by employee benefit trusts and Anglo American plc shares held by Group companies.
2 Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
In the year ended 31 December 2010 there were no share options which were anti-dilutive.
In the year ended 31 December 2009 there were 231,351 share options which were potentially dilutive but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.
In April 2009 the Group issued $1.7 billion of senior convertible notes.
The senior convertible notes were issued with a coupon of 4%, a conversion price of 18.6370 and unless redeemed, converted or cancelled, will mature in 2014.
The Group will have the option to call the senior convertible notes after three years from the issuance date subject to certain conditions.
The impact of this potential conversion has been included in diluted earnings and diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding.
