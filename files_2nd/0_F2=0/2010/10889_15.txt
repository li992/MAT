d Liquidity analysis We determine our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12 month period.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date: Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2010 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 120 92 81 2,583 2,876 Interest payments on borrowings i 91 92 93 1,391 1,667 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 172 2 - - 174 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts - receipts 49 28 33 325 435 Derivative contract - payments 22 15 17 232 286 Total at 31 March 2010 356 173 158 3,881 4,568 Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2009 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 561 - - 2,687 3,248 Interest payments on borrowings i 101 94 97 1,491 1,783 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 153 - - - 153 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contract - receipts 166 46 21 249 482 Derivative contract - payments 15 13 10 157 195 Total at 31 March 2009 664 61 86 4,086 4,897 i The interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at 31 March without taking account of future issues.
Floating rate interest is estimated using a future interest rate curve as at 31 March.

Financial risk continued e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK Retail Prices Index.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant, and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The assumptions made in calculating the sensitivity analysis are as per those for NGG as a whole and have therefore no further information has been provided in this appendix The following table shows the illustrative impact on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK Retail Prices Index and UK interest rates, after the effects of tax.
2010 2009 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity - m - m - m - m UK Retail Prices Index - 0.50% 4- 4- UK interest rates - 0.50% 27 46 The income statement sensitivities impact interest expense and financial instrument remeasurements.
f Capital and risk management NGG's objective when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to remain within regulatory constraints.
The principal measure of balance sheet efficiency is gearing calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of regulatory asset value.
The gearing ratio at 31 March 2010 for the NTS business was 55% compared with 59% at 31 March 2009.
Share options and reward plans Information on the share option and award plans operated by NGG relates to NGG as a whole and therefore no further analysis or information relating to note 29 is required in this appendix.
Ultimate parent company Information on NGG's ultimate parent company relates to NGG as a legal entity and therefore no further information is required in this appendix.
