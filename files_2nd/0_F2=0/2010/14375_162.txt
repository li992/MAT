Goodwill is allocated to the cashgenerating unit that is expected to benefit from the acquisition.

Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets.

Goodwill continued Each of the Groups operating segments represent a cash-generating unit and include goodwillas follows: 2010 2009 $ million $ million Orthopaedics 582 562 Endoscopy 280 280 Advanced Wound Management 239 251 1,101 1,093 In September 2010 and 2009 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each operating segment with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December.
In 2009, an impairment was made for the goodwill relating to the pain management business contained within the Orthopaedics cash generating unit, which was held forsale.
For each cash generating unit CGU the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings.
The five-year period is in line with the Groups strategic planning process.
Growth rates for the five year period for the Orthopaedics business vary up to 9% 2009 8%, for the Endoscopy business up to 10% 2009 9% and for the Advanced Wound Management business up to 8% 2009 8%.
The calculation of value-in-use forthe three identified CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set out below: The discount rate reflects managements assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Orthopaedics business is 11% 2009 11%, for the Endoscopy businesses it is 15% 2009 12% and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 10% 2009 9%.
In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered the annual sales growth and trading margins.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year.
 and strategies taken into account in determining the sales growth and trading marginforeach CGU are: Orthopaedics In the Orthopaedic CGU management intends to deliver growth through continuing to focus on the customer, high quality customer service and innovative product development, and through continuing to improve efficiencies.
Endoscopy It is managements intent to maintain and grow this CGU as the leading provider of endoscopic techniques and technologies for joint and ligament repair.
This is driven partly through the growing acceptance of Endoscopy as a preferred surgical choice amongst physicians and patients, product innovation, high quality customer service, and supporting surgeon educational programmes.
Advanced Wound Management Management intends to develop this CGU by focusing on the higher added value sectors of exudate and infection management through improved wound bed preparation, moist and active healing and negative pressure wound therapy, and by continuing to improve efficiency.
A growth rate of 4% 2009 4% in pre-tax cash flows is assumed after five years in calculating a terminal value for the Groups CGUs.
Management considers this to be an appropriate estimate based on the growth rates of the markets in which the Group operates.
Capital expenditure represents the Groups expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets.
This is approximately 8% 2009 8% of annual revenue.
