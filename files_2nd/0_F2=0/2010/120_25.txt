K. Limited is a trading subsidiary of Taut International Limited.
Taut U. K. Limited formed part of the acquisition detailed above.
It has tax losses of approximately 4,457,000.
Under IFRS 3 a deferred tax asset should be recognised if A. G. BARR p. l. c. can use the unrelieved tax losses.
At the date of approval of these statements A. G. BARR p. l. c. was unable to conclude with reasonable certainty that the tax losses can be utilised and therefore the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset at the balance sheet date in respect of these losses.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset would be approximately 1,248,000.

Included in the closing balance is 59,000 2009: 59,000 of a government grant received in respect of the Atherton production site.
Until the Atherton site was classi ed as an asset classi ed as held for sale the grant was amortised to the income statement over the expected life of the site.
The amortisation ceased at the date that the site was classi ed as held for sale as the site was no longer being depreciated.
The balance will be released to the income statement when the site is sold.
The grant is not repayable to its issuer.

25 Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, cash ow interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Group finance department identi es, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The board provides guidance on overall risk management including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
In addition treasury matters are dealt with by the Treasury Committee.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally.
The Group primarily buys and sells in U. K. Sterling but does have some purchases and sales denominated in US Dollars and Euros.
For the year ended 30 January 2010 if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US dollar or Euro, with all other variables held constant, there would have been a negligible effect on post tax pro t 31 January 2009: negligible impact on post tax pro t. The Group periodically enters into forward option contracts to purchase Euros for known capital purchases where the value and volume of the purchase is known.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no such investments are held by the Group.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk As the Group has no signi cant interest-bearing assets, the Groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by covering a signi cant proportion of its exposure using oating-toxed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to major and direct to store customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
If major customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control processes assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the board.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
Sales to direct to store customers are settled in cash or through invoicing.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 87 Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining suf cient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group maintains exibility in funding by maintaining suf cient cash reserves and the availability of borrowing facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve which comprises undrawn borrowing facility and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash ows.
This is carried out at a Group level and involves projecting cash ows for capital expenditure and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Capital risk management The Group fide fines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the Group to grow, whilst operating with suf cient headroom within its bank covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the Group balances returns to shareholders between long-term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt EBITDA ratio.
Net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing loans and borrowings.
The net debt position is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 14 to 20.
The net debt EBITDA ratio enables the Group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The Group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The Group believes that the current net debt EBITDA ratio provides an ef cient capital structure and an acceptable level of financial exibility.
For the year ended 30 January 2010 the net debt EBITDA ratio was 0.6 times 2009: 1.0 times.
The Group monitors capital ef ciency on the basis of the return on capital employed ratio ROCE.
26 Retirement bene t obligations During the year the Company operated three pension schemes.
The two main schemes are the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 fide ned Contribution Scheme and the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a fide ned bene t scheme based on final salary which also includes a fide ned contribution section for the pension provision to new executive entrants.
The Company also operated a Group Personal Pension scheme for a limited number of Rubicon employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds.
Full valuations of these schemes were conducted as at 1 April 2008 using the attained age method.
The total assets of the schemes at valuation were 59,963,000.
The assumptions which have the most signi cant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate, rate of in ation, real salary growth above in ation and life expectancy.
For the purposes of the 1 April 2008 valuation it was assumed that the investment return would be 1.85% per annum higher than the growth in pensionable pay.
In the period after retirement it was assumed that the investment return would be 0.6% per annum higher than the increase in pensions.
The fide cit as at 1 April 2008 determined using the above assumptions was 10,300,000.
The valuation used for the fide ned bene t scheme has been based on market conditions as at the Company year end.
The full actuarial valuation carried out at 1 April 2008 was updated to 30 January 2010 by a quali ed independent actuary.

Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement bene ts based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement bene ts are provided.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation and reduced to re ect estimated investment management expenses, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of an assumption of 6.23% for the year ending 29 January 2011 6.25% for the year ending 30 January 2010.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 91 27 Share capital 2010 2009 Group and Company Shares Shares Authorised ordinary shares of 12.5p 2009: 25p each 24,000,000 6,000,000 Issued and fully paid 38,922,926 4,865,366 19,461,463 4,865,366 The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to xed income.
On 18 September 2009 a general meeting passed a resolution to subdivide the Companys issued and to be issued share capital.
Each ordinary share of 25 pence was subdivided into two ordinary shares of 12.5p each.
The subdivision doubled the number of ordinary shares in issue and the board believes that the subdivision will improve liquidity and marketability of the ordinary shares.
At the annual general meeting held on 26 May 2009, the shareholders passed a resolution amending the Companys Articles of Association with effect from 1 October 2009.
From this date onwards, the Company was no longer required to have an authorised share capital, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
As a result, the 2010 authorised ordinary shares gure is nil.
During the year to 30 January 2010 the Companys employee bene t trusts purchased 199,939 2009: 124,576 shares.
The total amount paid to acquire the shares has been deducted from shareholders equity and included within retained earnings.
At 30 January 2010 the shares held by the Companys employee bene t trusts represented 607,047 2009: 296,229 shares at a purchased cost of 3,885,450 2009: 3,257,607.
The number of shares purchased in the year to 31 January 2009 and held at that date have been restated to re ect the share subdivision that took place in the year to 30 January 2010.
The restatement re ects the position as if the share subdivision had taken place on 27 January 2008.
28 Share-based payments As disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report the Group runs a number of share award plans and share option plans: Savings Related Share Option Scheme which is open to all employees AESOP awards that are available to all employees LTIP options which are granted to executive directors The share subdivision that was approved on 18 September 2009 resulted in doubling the number of options outstanding at that date and halving the fair value of those options.
The net result of these two changes had no impact on the charge recognised in the income statement or the share-based payment balances included in the statement of financial position.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE All SAYEs outstanding at 30 January 2010 and 31 January 2009 have no performance criteria attached other than the requirement for the employee to remain in the employment of the Company and to continue contributing to the plan.
Options granted under the SAYE must be exercised within six months of the relevant award vesting date.
The SAYE is open to all qualifying employees in employment at the date of inception of the scheme.
