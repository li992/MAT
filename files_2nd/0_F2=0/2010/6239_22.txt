The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies.
The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 28 February 2011.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Companys financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America US dollars or US$ and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand US$000 except when otherwise indicated.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
b Standards, interpretations and amendment The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
New standards, amendments and interpretations that are effective but not applicable to the Company are as follows: IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations and IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 39 Amendment Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement-Eligible hedged items.
Improvements to IFRSs In April 2009 the Board issued its second omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies but did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Company: IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows clarifies that only expenditures that result in a recognised asset can be classified as a cash flow from investing activities.
The amendment has no impact on the Company.
Other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRS did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company.
New and amended standards and interpretations Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Companys financial statements are listed below.
This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the Company reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date.
The Company intends to adopt those standards when they become effective.
The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.
In November 2010, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement subsequently amended in October 2010.
This new standard represents the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 165 assets as defined in IAS 39.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and derecognition.
The completion of this project is expected in early 2011.
The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Companys financial assets.
The Company will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
In October 2010, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets, which are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
The Company intends to adopt this standard when it becomes effective.
The Company considers that the amendments to IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Revised, which are relevant to the Group, will not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company.
In May 2010 the IASB issued improvements to IFRSs, a further omnibus of amendments to its standards.
These amendments have not been adopted as they become effective for annual periods on or after either 1 July 2010 or 1 January 2011.
The Company, however, expects no impact from the adoption of the amendments on its financial position or performance.
c Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimation and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
These judgments and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgments and estimation is in the accounting policies and or the notes to the financial statements.
Judgments Areas of judgment, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: Determination of functional currency note 2 d : The determination of functional currency requires management judgment, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the consolidated financial information include: Income tax notes 2 n and 5: Judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets.
Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction.
To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries notes 2 e and 6: The Company assesses the investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
A value in use assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge.
At 31 December 2010, no impairment has been recognised.
At 31 December 2010 an impairment reversal of US$108.0 million 2009: US$1,323.2 million was recognised.
Valuation of derivative financial instruments notes 2 p and 17: Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report FINANCIALS 166 NOTES TO ThE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Contingent liabilities regarding claims from tax authorities note 13: By nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
The assessment of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgment and estimates of the outcome of future events.
d foreign currency translation The Companys financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.
The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.
e Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are initially recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
Subsequent to initial recognition investment in subsidiaries are recognised at fair value determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition or return of capital to the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.
An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that which would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
f financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held to maturity investments: or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss on inception are included in this category.
Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term.
Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost.
GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 167 Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market: therefore a fair value can be reliably measured.
After initial measurement, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are fide-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense.
Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available and for listed non-actively traded securities, fair value is determined using a valuation technique.
Valuation techniques include using a recent arms length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value.
g Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement.
In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
h Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report FINANCIALS 168 NOTES TO ThE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued i Share Capital Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue.
The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
j financial liabilities The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
k Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements and are disclosed in notes unless their occurrence is remote.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements, but they are disclosed in notes if they are deemed probable.
l Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.
Trademark Royalties Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received.
Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method: i. e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
m finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability.
n Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 169 Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: i where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: i where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
o fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally fide-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
p Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in prices of base metals and foreign exchange which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
In the Groups consolidated financial statements these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Companys stand alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
The cash flows from these derivatives are therefore not related to financing activities of the Company and the presentation in the Parent Company Cash Flow Statement has been amended to include them within investing activities.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report FINANCIALS 170 NOTES TO ThE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows.
Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
q Dividend Distribution Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
r value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax.
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
s Borrowing costs Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets requiring a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use.
In the case of such qualifying assets, finance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use.
The amount of finance costs capitalised before the effects of income tax for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period.
3 PROFIT OR LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ThE PARENT COMPANY The profit for the Company is US$483.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: US$1,475.3 million.

The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$503.5 million 2009: US$184.3 million.
Income Tax Impuesto Sobre la Renta or ISR and Business Flat Tax Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica or IETU In accordance to the Mexican tax law, the Company is subject to Income Tax ISR and Business Flat Tax IETU.
IETU is an alternative minimum corporate income tax effective in January 1, 2008 which replaced the business asset tax.
Companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU.
th On 7 December 2009 new temporary tax rates were published in the Official Daily of the Federal Government.
The tax income rate for 2009 was 28%, for 2010 is 30% and will continue in effect for 2011 and 2012, the tax rate for 2013 will be 29% and the tax rate for 2014 will be 28%.
The deferred taxes have been calculated at the rate applicable to the year the amounts are expected to materialise.
IETU is calculated at the rate of 17% for the calendar year 2009 and 17.5% for subsequent years and applies to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods.
In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income.
In respect of the Company, management has undertaken calculations to determine the impact of the new IETU provisions on the Company.
As a result of such analysis, management has concluded that there should be no material impact on the Company, other than a US$6.1 million tax credit arising under IETU that was recognised in 2009 since the mainstream corporate income tax liability of the Company is forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge.
These conditions continued in 2010 and no IETU liability is expected to arise in the foreseeable future.

The Companys exposure to currency and liquidity risk related to trade and other payables in disclosed in note 18.
13 CONTINGENCIES As of 31 December 2010 the Company has the following contingencies: a The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
b Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest.
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest.
It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome.
However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
c On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peoles entered into the Separation Agreement the Separation Agreement.
This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group the Group and the Peoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 Admission.

Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.
GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 175 Peoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: i any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peoles Group on or after Admission, the Global Offer or Admission and ii certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions.

18 FINANCIAL RISk MANAGEMENT Overview The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets and trade payables.
The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.
The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: a Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks b Credit risk c Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Companys exposure to each of the above risks and the Companys objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.
The Companys risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities.
The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar primarily the Mexican Peso and UK pound sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchases of services and other items.
As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in Mexican Pesos.
The Company also holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican Pesos.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican Peso, reflecting the impact on the Companys profit before tax with all other variables held constant.
It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable exchange rates for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets.
GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 181 The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties failure to honour their obligations.
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties with what the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
At each balance sheet date, the Companys financial assets were neither impaired nor past due.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency hedging contracts.
The Companys foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings The Companys surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S. A. fide C. V. which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions.
In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 Moodys and mxA-1 Standard and Poors and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days.
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes.
See note 7 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 9 for cash and cash equivalents and note 14 for related party balances.
c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

It is the Companys expectation that currency option contracts will not be exercised unless doing so is beneficial to the Company.
Options that are not expected to be beneficial to the Company have therefore been excluded from the liquidity analysis.
Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital management The primary objective of the Companys capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value.
Management considers capital to consist only of equity as disclosed in the balance sheet.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.
