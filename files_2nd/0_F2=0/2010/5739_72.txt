Exillon Energy Notes to audited 2010 IFRS financial statements any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated: however, it may be significant to the financial condition and or the overall operations of the entity.
Russian tax legislation does not provide definitive guidance in certain areas.
From time to time, the Group adopts interpretations of such uncertain areas that reduce the overall tax rate of the Group.
As noted above, such tax positions may come under heightened scrutiny as a result of recent developments in administrative and court practices: the impact of any challenge by the tax authorities cannot be reliably estimated: however, it may be significant to the financial condition and or the overall operations of the entity.
The Group includes companies incorporated outside of the Russian Federation.
Tax liabilities of the Group are determined on the assumption that these companies are not subject to Russian profits tax because they do not have a permanent establishment in Russia.
Russian tax laws do not provide detailed rules on taxation of foreign companies.
It is possible that with the evolution of the interpretation of these rules and the changes in the approach of the Russian tax authorities, the non-taxable status of some or all of the foreign companies of the Group in Russia may be challenged.
The impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated: however, it may be significant to the financial position and or the overall operations of the entity.
Environmental matters The enforcement of environmental regulation in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture of government authorities is continually being reconsidered.
The Group periodically evaluates its obligations under environmental regulations.
As obligations are determined, they are recognised immediately.
Potential liabilities, which might arise as a result of changes in existing regulations, civil litigation or legislation, cannot be estimated but could be material.
In the current enforcement climate under existing legislation, management believes that there are no significant liabilities for environmental damage.
