This transaction has been accounted for as a capital restructuring of EnQuest and the former Lundin business Lundin North Sea, LNS and an acquisition of the former Petrofac business Petrofac Energy Developments Limited, PEDL.
Consequently the Group statement of comprehensive income, prepared in accordance with IFRS and published on page 55 of the Group Financial Statements, includes the results of LNS from the start of the 2010 calendar year but only from 5 April 2010 for PEDL.
For the comparative period to 31 December 2009, the reported statement of comprehensive income includes the results of LNS only.
The results of EnQuest are included from its incorporation date of 29 January 2010.
This abridged pro-forma income statement presents the trading results for both LNS and PEDL from the start of the 2010 calendar year, as though PEDL was part of the group for the full year ended 31 December 2010.
The comparative data for the year ended 31 December 2009 is presented on the same basis.
2 EBITDA is calculated by taking profit loss from operations before tax and finance income costs and adding back depletion, depreciation and impairment and write off of tangible and intangible oil and gas assets.
EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS.
Pro-forma profit before tax and net finance costs rose to US$169.4 million, compared to US$24.6 million in 2009.
Pro-forma EBITDA was 196% up at US$369.3 million.
