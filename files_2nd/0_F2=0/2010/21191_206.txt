224 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 19 Interests in, and loans to, associates continued Although the Groups holding in one of the three Cyrte funds is less than 20%, it has significant influence through ownership of the fund manager, Cyrte Investments BV, a subsidiary of which acts as general partner to the funds, and through membership of its investment committee.
The Groups Dutch subsidiary owns 30.6% of the shares, and depositary receipts for shares, in Van Lanschot NV, a financial services company in the Netherlands.
The Group is not able to appoint management representation on the board of this company and is therefore unable to exert significant influence over its affairs.
Accordingly, this investment is treated as a financial investment rather than as an associate.

d Impairment testing All interests in associates have been tested for impairment but the only material items are detailed below.
i Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited The Groups investment in Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value which includes goodwill which arose on their acquisition with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
This calculation is an actuarially determined appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the investment.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Cash flow projections based on i the policy portfolio existing at the valuation date: and ii the future sales based on plans approved by management covering the subsequent three-year period.
The cash flows from the existing policy portfolio are calculated using best estimate assumptions, which have been supported by experience investigations where available and prudent estimates typical for the market where experience investigations are not available: The embedded values for existing business was derived using risk free rates: The value in use was derived as the sum of embedded value of existing business and the new business contribution in each future year discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate of 17.3%: and New sales beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 14% for seven years and 10% thereafter.
Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited is a developing business and the recoverability of value is reliant on future projected growth being achieved.
In addition local regulatory changes have resulted in changes to the types of product that can be sold.
The growth projections are inherently uncertain and dependent on local economic and regulatory conditions.
ii Banca Network Investimenti SpA A review of strategy by the owners of Banca Network Investimenti SpA has significantly changed the future business plans and nature of the activities of this associate.
As a result of this change in the prospects of the associate, management no longer believe that its carrying value is fully recoverable.
This has generated an impairment of 20 million.
Other impairments arise from UK long-term business intermediary associates.
