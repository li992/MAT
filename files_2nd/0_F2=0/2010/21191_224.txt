The Groups regulated subsidiaries are required to hold sufficient capital to meet acceptable solvency levels based on applicable local regulations.
Their ability to transfer retained earnings to the UK parent companies is therefore restricted to the extent these earnings form part of local regulatory capital.

During that year, both sets of minority shareholders indicated that they intended to exercise these options in 2010.
We therefore reclassified their interests as at 31 December 2009 to financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.
These transactions were completed during 2010 with the exercise of both sets of options.
