DEfERRED TAxATiON continued The deferred tax assets disclosed relate to the Groups pension scheme liabilities.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was nil 2009 1.7m.
No liability was recognised in respect of these differences because the Group was in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it was probable that such differences would not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled entities are recorded as part of the Groups share of investment in those entities.
The aggregate amount of these is a charge of 34.1m 2009 1.0m credit.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on 35m of trading losses 2009 30m due to uncertainty around the availability of future profits in the companies concerned.
