192 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 3 Subsidiaries This note provides details of the acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries that the Group has made during the year, together with details of businesses held for sale at the year end.
The principal Group subsidiaries are listed on pages 40 to 41. a Acquisitions i River Road Asset Management On 24 February 2010, the Group acquired 100% of River Road Asset Management River Road, a US equity manager, to support the expansion of Aviva Investors third-party institutional asset management business.
The total consideration was estimated as 83 million US$128 million, of which 37 million US$57 million was paid in cash on completion.
The balance comprises undiscounted contingent consideration.
The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay additional amounts, based on a multiple of the earnings 1.0792 times during the next five years, up to a maximum of 70 million US$108 million.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is between 26 million US$41 million and 53 million US$82 million.
A fair value liability of 24 million, using a discount rate of 17%, has been recognised for potential consideration that is payable in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
The acquisition has given rise to goodwill of 29 million, calculated as follows: m Purchase cost: Cash paid 37 Contingent consideration arrangement fair value 24 Total consideration 61 The estimated book and fair values of the assets and liabilities at the acquisition date were: Fair value and accounting policy Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Assets Intangible assets 31 31 Receivables and other assets 3 3 Total assets 3 31 34 Liabilities Payables and other liabilities 2 2 Total liabilities 2 2 Total identifiable net assets 1 31 32 Goodwill arising on acquisition 29 The fair value adjustment for intangible assets relates to customer relationships acquired.
Goodwill of 29 million arising from this acquisition consists largely of the expected benefits from new business and new product introductions.
The results of River Road have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group with effect from 24 February 2010, and have contributed 10 million revenues and 4 million loss to the consolidated profit before tax.
Had it been consolidated from 1 January 2010, River Road would have contributed 12 million revenues and 5 million loss to the consolidated profit before tax.
ii RBS Life Investments Limited During the year, the Group reviewed its relationship with RBS Group plc RBSG which comprised interests in two associates, RBS Life Investments Limited RBS Life and RBSG Collective Investments Limited RBS Collective, and a distribution arrangement for the products of these companies.
The parties agreed that, with effect from 31 December 2010, the Group would take ownership of the back book of RBS Life in exchange for RBSG taking 100% ownership of RBS Collective through a share-for-share exchange.
Separately, a new distribution agreement would be signed between our UK Life business and RBSG, with the new structure providing more flexibility in our long-term business operations.
On 31 December 2010, the Group acquired 50.01% of the shares of RBS Life from RBSG.
Combined with our existing 49.99% interest, the Group now owns all the ordinary shares of that entity, and has full control.
It is being consolidated as a subsidiary from that date.
As consideration for the acquisition, the Group transferred its 49.99% shareholding in RBS Collective to RBSG, together with cash of 3 million for 2010 performance variance.
In addition, the existing distribution agreement ceased.
Because of the nature of the transaction, the Groups pre-existing interests in RBS Life and RBS Collective were re-measured to fair value as at the transaction date.

The fair value of RBS Life was estimated using MCEV principles and with regard to current market conditions.
The estimated book and fair values of the assets and liabilities of RBS Life at the acquisition date were: Fair value and accounting policy Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Assets Acquired value of in-force business 203 203 Financial investments 2,565 2,565 Other investments 161 161 Reinsurance assets 304 304 Receivables 58 58 Prepayments and accrued income 12 12 Cash and cash equivalents 767 767 Other assets 80 80 Total assets 3,947 203 4,150 Liabilities Insurance liabilities 1,349 1,349 Liabilities for investment contracts 1,905 1,905 Payables and other financial liabilities 60 60 Other liabilities 109 109 Total liabilities 3,423 3,423 Total net assets 524 203 727 No goodwill arises from this transaction.
There is no potential deferred tax on the acquired value of in-force business.
As the acquisition occurred on 31 December 2010, no revenue or profit or loss has been recognised in the consolidated income statement since the acquisition date.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2010, RBS Life would have contributed 188 million revenues and 56 million profit to the consolidated profit before tax.
iii Other goodwill arising Goodwill arising on all acquisitions, as shown in note 16 a, was 29 million, which arises on the River Road acquisition described above.
There has also been a 4 million reduction in goodwill for changes in contingent consideration payable on previous acquisitions.
