The tax rate on acquisition amortisation and specific non-recurring items in 2009 exceeds the overall Group tax rate as it primarily relates to items subject to the higher US tax rate.
Factors affecting future tax charges The effective tax rate continues to be below the statutory rate in the UK primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development relief in the UK.
The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any future tax legislation changes.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 32.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options.

In the year two CGUs in the EMEA business were amalgamated into one to reflect the way in which these CGUs are managed and operated.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and staff knowledge, expertise, customer contacts and security clearances.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use discounted future cash flows based on the most recent forecasts from the five-year corporate plan.
The five-year corporate plan is approved by the Board.
Cash flows for periods beyond this period are extrapolated based on the final year of the corporate plan, with a terminal growth rate assumption applied.
Terminal growth rates The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 1.5% to 2.5% 2009: 2.5% to 3.0%.
Growth rates are formed based on managements estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term.
Discount rates The Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied, adjusted for risks, specific to the geographical location of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis.
The pre-tax discount rate applied for QNA CGUs was 11.8%12.1% and a range from 9.3%16.9% for EMEA CGUs.
Impairment The in year impairment charge of 50.1m arises in three CGUs: Technology Solutions in QNA 11.4m : Mission Solutions in QNA 30.8m : and Australia in EMEA 7.9m.
Defence markets remain challenging as a result of the economic environment and both CGUs have seen a moderation in market growth expectations which has led the Group to re-evaluate the growth forecasts for the CGU, including the long-term growth rate.
Additionally, Technology Solutions in QNA has been affected by the finalisation of the strategy for the USs continued involvement in Afghanistan and the completion of key Department of Defense DoD leadership appointments.
The Australian CGU impairment reflects an overall moderation in anticipated market growth which has, in turn, had an impact on the growth assumptions for this CGU and an associated moderation in the terminal growth rate.
com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 63 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 11.
Goodwill continued Significant CGUs Sensitivity analysis shows that both the discount rate and growth rate assumptions are key components of the outcome of the recoverable amount.
The Technology Solutions CGU was impaired during the year by 11.4m.
If the discount rate assumption was increased by 1% the impairment charge would have increased by 28.1m to 39.5m or, conversely, should the discount rate have been 1% lower this would have given the CGU headroom of 28.3m.
Sensitivity analysis shows that a move of up to 1% in the terminal growth rate could result in an impairment of 33.8m or headroom of 20.3m.
The resulting carrying value of goodwill for this CGU at 31 March 2010 was 120.7m.
The Systems Engineering CGU had headroom, with current assumptions, of 109.1m.
The Groups sensitivity analysis shows that the pre-tax discount rate would have to increase to 16.6% or the terminal growth rate to decline to 1.4 % to cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March 2010 was 161.4m.
During the period, the Mission Solutions business was impaired by 30.8m.
If discount rates were assumed to be 1% higher the impairment charge would have increased by 53.4m to 84.2m.
Conversely, if discount rates were 1% lower the CGU would have had a headroom of 47.3m.
The sensitivity to terminal growth rates would imply that a decrease of 1% would result in a further impairment of 43.8m, or an increase of 1% would show the CGU with headroom of 32.9m.
The resulting carrying value of goodwill for this CGU at 31 March 2010 was 240.4m.
In EMEA, the Managed Services and Consulting CGUs have significant headroom.
An increase in either the discount rate or decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The Technology Solutions CGU in EMEA has headroom, under current assumptions, of 21.7m.
If the discount rate was to decrease or increase by 1%, the CGU would have headroom of 43.9m or 5.7m respectively.
Similarly, if terminal growth rates were to decrease or increase by 1%, headroom would be 9.3m or 39.1m respectively.
During the period, the Australia CGU was impaired by 7.9m.
If discount rates were assumed to be 1% higher the impairment charge would have increased by 0.7m to 8.6m.
Conversely, if discount rates were 1% lower the extent of the impairment would have been reduced by 0.8m to 7.1m.
The sensitivity to terminal growth rates would imply that a decrease of 1% would result in a further impairment of 0.5m or an increase of 1% would reduce the impairment by 0.6m.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions since 31 March 2010 and the signing of the financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Capital, treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board, setting out specific guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives.
Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
These policies are discussed further in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 12-15.
A Fair values of financial instruments Effective 1 April 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, for the financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices including within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.

Financial risk management continued For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments approximate to their carrying value due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available.
Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year-end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where a fair value equals carrying value.
All financial assets and liabilities have a fair value identical to book value at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009 except where noted below: As at 31 March 2010 Financial asset fair value Financial through liabilities at Derivatives Total income Available Loans and amortised used as carrying Total fair all figures in million note statement for sale receivables hedges value value cost Financial assets Non-current Net investment in finance lease 31 10.0 10.0 11.4 Equity accounted investments 16 0.9 0.9 0.9 17 Other investments 4.8 4.8 4.8 Current Derivative financial instruments 15 4.8 4.8 4.8 Net investment in finance leases 31 3.0 3.0 3.0 Trade and other receivables 19 423.8 423.8 423.8 Investments 20 2.3 2.3 2.3 Cash and cash equivalents 21 63.9 63.9 63.9 4.8 8.0 500.7 513.5 514.9 Financial liabilities Non-current Trade and other payables 22 35.2 35.2 35.2 Derivative financial instruments 26 1.0 1.0 1.0 Bank and other borrowings 26 519.5 519.5 552.7 Finance lease 31 9.7 9.7 10.7 Current Trade and other payables 22 396.4 396.4 396.4 Derivative financial instruments 25 3.6 3.6 3.6 Finance lease 31 2.8 2.8 2.8 Bank overdraft and finance costs 25 2.5 2.5 2.5 966.1 4.6 970.7 1,004.9 Total 4.8 8.0 500.7 966.1 4.6 457.2 490.0 75 74 www.

Financial risk management continued B Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require rates to be fixed for 3080% of the level of borrowings, but with a maximum 100% fixed for no more than 12 months.
This is achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 March 2010 98% 2009: 73% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
Financial assets liabilities As at 31 March 2010 Financial asset Financial liability Fixed or Non-interest Fixed or Non-interest all figures in million capped Floating bearing capped Floating bearing Sterling 13.0 56.3 10.5 12.5 0.3 0.8 US dollar 4.4 515.2 0.1 3.8 Euro 1.4 5.2 Australian dollar 1.8 2.3 1.2 13.0 63.9 12.8 527.7 6.8 4.6 As at 31 March 2009 Financial asset Financial liability Fixed or Non-interest Fixed or Non-interest all figures in million capped Floating bearing capped Floating bearing Sterling 14.6 216.1 16.5 14.2 97.7 18.5 US dollar 42.6 581.1 69.6 5.1 Euro 1.4 11.6 Australian dollar 2.0 0.6 16.9 14.6 262.1 17.1 595.3 195.8 23.6 Floating rate financial assets attract interest based on the relevant national LIBID equivalent.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at the relevant national LIBOR equivalent.
Trade and other receivables payables are excluded from this analysis.
For the fixed or capped rate financial assets and liabilities, the average interest rates including the relevant marginal cost of borrowing and the average period for which the rates are fixed are: 2010 2009 Weighted Weighted Fixed or Weighted Fixed or Weighted average average capped interest rate average years capped interest rate average years m % to maturity m % to maturity Financial assets: Sterling 13.0 13.4% 5.5 14.6 13.4% 6.5 Financial liabilities: Sterling 12.5 12.1% 5.5 14.2 12.1% 6.5 US dollar 515.2 5.9% 4.8 581.1 5.8% 5.5 527.7 6.1% 4.8 595.3 5.9% 5.5 Sterling assets and liabilities consist primarily of finance leases with the weighted average interest rate reflecting the internal rate of return of those leases.
Interest rate risk management The majority of the Group's bank and private placement borrowings were fixed through a combination of interest rate swaps and fixed rate debt.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2010 was 138.4m or US$210m 31 March 2009: 188.1m or US$270m.
The swaps have the economic effect of converting floating rate US dollar borrowings into fixed rate US dollar borrowings and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Financial risk management continued C Currency risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Groups transactional hedge contracts.
The table below shows the Group's currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.
Functional currency of the operating company Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities all figures in million US dollar Euro Australian dollar Other Total 31 March 2010 sterling 5.1 1.4 4.1 0.4 11.0 31 March 2009 sterling 5.6 1.4 0.6 0.9 8.5 The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs.
The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2010 against sterling are net US dollars sold of 6.2m $9.4m and net Euros sold of 12.5m 14.1m.
Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movement in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies unless the cost of such hedging activity is uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing in the local currency, or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment hedges The Group had one 6 million currency loan designated as a net investment hedge at 31 March 2010, but no swap contracts.
During the year the Group fide-designated currency loans of $210m which had previously been used to hedge translational currency exposures, and entered into offsetting currency swaps to eliminate any future exchange exposure arising from this loan.
D Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits, normally at least AA or equivalent.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals 80.2m.
At 31 March 2010 the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits and cash was 41.9m, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for derivatives was 4.8m.
These exposures were with different financial institutions rated AA or better.

Financial risk management continued H Sensitivity analysis The Groups sensitivity to changes in market rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2010 is set out in the table below.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1 percent 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2010, with all other variables remaining constant.

The options vest after three years.
For 8,711,683 2009: 17,930,229 of the options outstanding at the end of the year the number that will vest is dependent upon the growth of earnings per share EPS over the measurement period.
25% of options will vest if EPS growth is 22.5% for the period and 100% will vest if growth is at least 52%.
No options will vest if EPS growth is below 22.5%.
Options will vest on a straight line basis if EPS growth is between 22.5% and 52%.
There were no options subject to total shareholder return TSR performance targets 2009: 173,071.
For awards with a TSR performance condition, the EPS growth target is replaced by a performance target based on QinetiQs ranking by reference to total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of FTSE listed companies over a three-year performance period such that a below median ranking will result in nil shares vesting, at the median level 30% of the options would vest and the amount vested will increase on a straight line basis such that 100% would vest if TSR reaches the upper quartile of the ranking over a three-year period.

Share-based award pricing options Share options excluding TSR performance related and awards under the deferred annual bonus plan have been valued using Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of awards.
Assumptions used within the models were as follows for awards in 2009, there were no such awards in 2010: 2009 Share price at date of grant pence 198.5p Exercise price pence 198.5p Volatility % 31.0% Average expected term to exercise 3 years Risk-free rate % 4.3% Expected dividend yield % 2.2% No such assumptions have been disclosed in the current year, as no QSOS awards have been made in the year ended 31 March 2010.
The average share price in 2009 was 179.7p.
The expected volatility assumption is based on the average historic volatility of QinetiQs share price at the date of grant commensurate with the vesting period to the extent possible.
com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 87 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 33.
Share-based payments continued Share-based award pricing other Share-based awards involving market based performance conditions, including those based on TSR, have used Monte Carlo models to determine the fair value at grant date.
Assumptions used in these models included 41% 2009: 32% for the average share price volatility of the FTSE comparator group and 36% 2009: 33% for the average correlation to comparator group.
The fair value for these awards before the probability of lapsing in the year ended March 2010 was 66.5p 2009: 119.1p.
Share-based awards that vest based upon non-market performance conditions, including certain PSP, RSUs and Deferred Annual Bonus awards, have been valued at the share price at grant less attrition.
For the 2003 Share Option Scheme, there was a pre-bonus issue weighted average share price of 1 and a weighted average exercise price of 1 based on third-party transactions in the Companys shares in the period immediately prior to the issue of the share options.
Prior to IPO in February 2006 there was no active market for the Companys shares therefore expected volatility was determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of businesses.
At this time the Group had no established pattern of dividend payments, therefore no dividends were assumed in this model.

Transactions with MOD The MOD continues to own its special share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 32.
Transactions between the Group and the MOD are disclosed as follows: Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties Under the terms of the Group's acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.
i Restrictions on transfer of title The title deeds of those properties designated as strategic assets see below include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of the MOD.
The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances.
ii Property clawback agreement The MOD retains an interest in future profits on disposal following a trigger event.
A trigger event includes the granting of planning permission for development and or change of use, and the disposition of any of the acquired land and buildings.
During the 12 years from 1 July 2001, following a trigger event, the MOD is entitled to clawback a proportion of the gain on each individual property transaction in excess of a 30% gain on a July 2001 professional valuation.
The proportion of the excess gain due to the MOD is based on a sliding scale which reduces over time from 50% to 9% and at 31 March 2010 stands at 28% 2009: 33%.
The July 2001 valuation was approximately 16% greater in aggregate than the consideration paid for the land and buildings on 1 July 2001.
Compliance Regime The Compliance Committee monitors the effective application of the Compliance Regime required by the MOD to maintain the position of QinetiQ as a supplier of independent and impartial scientific technical advice to the MOD and ensures that the required standards are met in trials involving human volunteers.
Strategic assets Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: i dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset: or ii voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset.
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2010 was 2.5m 31 March 2009: 2.7m, the principal items being plant and machinery.
Long-Term Partnering Agreement On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long-Term Partnering Agreement to provide the Test and Evaluation T&E facilities and training support services to the MOD.
This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to 5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing the T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery.

Contingent liabilities and assets The Group, including subsidiary undertakings, have given unsecured guarantees primarily on leased properties and bank lines of 55.1m at 31 March 2010 31 March 2009: 34.7m in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is aware of claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the MOD and DERA and contractors, in respect of intellectual property, employment rights and industrial illness and injury which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, and the Group's insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that these matters will, in aggregate, have a material effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 or the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005.
Additional consideration, subject to clawback to the MOD pursuant to the arrangements referred to in note 35, is potentially due upon the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum dependent on the scope of the consent achieved.
Post-retirement benefits Triennial funding valuation The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2008 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 111.3m.
On the basis of this full valuation the Trustees of the scheme and the Company agreed the employer contribution rate of 11.5% from 30 June 2009, and past service deficit recovery payments of 13m per year for a 10-year period from this date.
Introduction and background to IAS 19 International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benefits requires the Group to include in the balance sheet the surplus or deficit on defined benefit schemes calculated as at the balance sheet date.
It is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit is, therefore, dependent on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries.
The QinetiQ Pension Scheme In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees, a mixed benefit scheme.
The Defined Benefit DB section of the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees.
All Group employees who were members, or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial Superannuation Scheme were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were previously members of schemes who are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club.
On 31 March 2010, the Group withdrew from the Public Sector Transfer Club.
The Defined Contribution DC section of the scheme was set up for employees who were not eligible or did not wish to join the DB section of the scheme.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group operates one further small defined benefit scheme, QinetiQ Prudential Platinum Scheme.
The net pension deficits of this scheme at 31 March 2010 amounted to 0.2m 31 March 2009: 0.2m.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date March 2009: nil.
Set out below is a summary of the overall IAS 19 defined benefit pension schemes liabilities.
The fair value of the schemes' assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus inherently uncertain, were: all figures in million 2010 2009 2008 2007 Equities 714.6 473.7 620.8 641.5 Corporate bonds 69.5 78.4 83.9 74.5 Government bonds 69.6 83.2 76.3 74.7 Property 53.4 Cash 8.8 12.1 3.2 3.4 Total market value of assets 915.9 647.4 784.2 794.1 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,063.2 752.6 807.6 884.9 Net pension liability before deferred tax 147.3 105.2 23.4 90.8 Deferred tax asset 41.2 29.4 6.5 27.1 Net pension liability 106.1 75.8 16.9 63.7 90 90 www.

It is important to note that these assumptions are long term, and in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate are measured by external market indicators.
The life expectancy assumptions for mortality have remained unchanged in the year to 31 March 2010 with the base tables for mortality in line with the Medium Cohort projections with minimum annual rates of improvement of 1% for males and 0.5% for females 2009: improvement 1% for males and 0.5% for females.
The current mortality rates reflect the standard tables PNMA00MC for males and PNFA00MC for females for members' year of birth.
These mortality tables are published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and adopted by the actuarial profession.
