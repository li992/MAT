As permitted by that Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company is not required to prepare a cash flow statement under Financial Reporting Standard 1 FRS 1 revised.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at their original historic cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment as set out in note 2.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: IT and other equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provision for impairment.
Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profit at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement either the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses as the related pre-tax item.
In accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Taxation, full provision is made for deferred tax on a non-discounted basis in respect of all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding sale agreement and undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries.
Deferred tax is calculated at rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent they are more likely than not to be recovered.
Tax, current and deferred, is calculated using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
For the principal rates of exchange used see the Group IFRS accounting policies on page 49.
Share based payment The Company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share based payments to certain employees.
Share based payment awards made by the Company to employees of its subsidiary companies are recognised in the Companys financial statements as an increase in its investments in subsidiary undertakings rather than as an expense in the profit and loss account to the extent that the amount of the expense recorded by each subsidiary company is less than the amount recharged to it by the Company.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense or as an increase in investments in subsidiary undertakings over the vesting period.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market based vesting conditions and no expense or investment is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest as a result of a failure to satisfy a non-market based vesting condition.
None of the Groups equity-settled transactions have any market based performance conditions.
Fair value for equity-settled share based payments is estimated by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense or investment is calculated based on managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest taking into consideration the likelihood of achieving non-market based vesting conditions.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value.
Fair value is estimated initially at the grant date and at each balance sheet date thereafter until the awards are settled.
Market based performance conditions are taken into account when determining fair value.
Fair value for cash-settled share based payments being only those that relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated by use of a simulation model.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the estimated fair value of the award and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the balance sheet date.
Choice of settlement The Company can choose to settle awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in cash.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are accounted for as cashsettled transactions see above.

Financial instruments The accounting policy of the Company under FRS 25 Financial instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement for financial instruments is the same as the accounting policy for the Group under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
Therefore for details of the Companys accounting policy for financial instruments refer to pages 51 to 53.
Investment in own shares In accordance with UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, own shares held by the Groups Employee Benefit Trust and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust have been classified as deductions from shareholders funds.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Company accounts for pensions and similar benefits under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits and measures its obligations due at discounted present value.
