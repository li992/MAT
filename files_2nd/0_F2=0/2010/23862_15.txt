ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts issued in January 2009. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments at fair value and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
A resolution proposing the continuation of the Company as an investment trust will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2011.
The Directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
In light of their recommendation and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 Accounting Policies, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Accordingly the financial statements do not include any adjustments that may arise from a reconstruction or liquidation of the Company.
Such adjustments would include expenses of reconstruction or liquidation along with any costs associated with realising the portfolio.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term deposits is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash foregone, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of the performance fee which is charged wholly to capital reserve as it arises mainly from capital returns on the portfolio.
Finance costs are accounted for using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
g Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially, and subsequently measured, at fair value, which is measured as follows: Investments listed overseas are valued at bid prices, or last prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: and Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs within gains losses on investments and has disclosed them in Note 9 on page 43. h Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Liquidity Fund plc Euro Fund the Fund.
The Fund invests in low risk short term investments.
It is a distributing fund and accordingly the interest earned within the Fund is treated as income.
Page 38 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements i Loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
j Capital reserve The following are accounted for in capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments: Changes in fair value of the investments held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fee chargeable to capital: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable profits that arise from changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the balance sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders funds and the Balance Sheet.
At the balance sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash.
k Dividends In accordance with FRS21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MANAGEMENT OF RISK This Note is incorporated in accordance with FRS29 and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Euro borrowings to finance operations The risks identified by FRS29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises other price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Market price risk Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through a euro denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loan which falls due for repayment on 15 December 2011.
The Company is exposed, therefore, to a fair value interest rate risk if euro interest rates change.
In addition the Company has the ability to draw on a euro 25,000,000 floating rate credit facility which expires on 15 December 2011.
The credit facility if drawn down would be subject to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The analysis below summarises the extent to which the Companys assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates.

Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and the bank loan Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivative instruments.
However, it has increased finance available to the Company for its investment activities with euro borrowings, thereby hedging part of the movements which are a result of exchange rate movements.
