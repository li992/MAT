Accrued pensions shown are the amounts that would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
Benefits deriving from Additional Voluntary Contributions AVCs paid by directors are excluded from the amounts above.
The change in transfer value allows for fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as changes in stock market conditions.
The transfer values have been calculated in line with the relevant legislation and using actuarial assumptions agreed by the trustee.
No former Directors received any increase in retirement benefits in excess of the amount to which they were entitled, on the later of the date when the benefits first became payable, or the 31 March 1997.
The transfer value of net increase decrease in accrued pension shows the value of the increase decrease in accrued pension net of inflation, over the year net of contributions.
Philip Scott ceased to accrue benefits in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme with effect from 30 June 2009.
Mr Scott subsequently took early retirement with effect from 1 August 2010.
As disclosed in the 2008 and 2009 Annual Report and Accounts, Mr Scott was entitled to receive a non-discounted pension with effect from January 2012, aged 58.
Consequently, his early retirement pension payable from 1 August 2010 amounted to 384,900 p. a. rather than 342,535 p. a.
To provide this additional 42,365 p. a. a cost was incurred to the Company of 1,227,539.
Mr Scott then surrendered 25,338 p. a. of his pension for a cash sum, reducing his pension payable from 1 August 2010 to 359,562 p. a.
Andrea Moneta left the Companys defined contribution scheme in 2009 and therefore did not accrue any further scheme benefits in 2010.
