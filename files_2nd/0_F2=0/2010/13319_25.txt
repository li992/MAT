As a substantial proportion of profits are generated outside the UK, the standard rate of tax has been determined as the weighted average of the standard rates of tax in each of the different countries where profits are generated.
The relevant rates were approximately 29% in 2010 and 27% in 2009.
The increase is caused by a change in the profitability of the groups subsidiaries in the respective countries.

Rentokil Initial plc Annual report 2010 Financial statements 77 Notes to the accounts Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and reportable segment.
A summary of the 2010 goodwill allocation by reportable segment is shown below: North Asia 2010 2009 UK Europe America Pacific Africa Total Total m m m m m m m Textiles & Hygiene 3.9 74.6 78.5 77.0 Pest Control 4.7 14.9 62.2 0.3 82.1 80.6 Asia Pacific 85.6 85.6 79.9 Ambius 2.8 13.5 16.3 15.8 City Link 108.1 108.1 203.1 Facilities Services 18.3 18.3 13.6 31 December 2010 135.0 92.3 75.7 85.6 0.3 388.9 31 December 2009 225.3 91.5 73.1 79.9 0.2 470.0 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and long-range plans approved by management covering a five-year period which are prepared as part of the groups normal planning process and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 2% and 3% and pre-tax discount rates of between 9% and 12% 2009: 10% and 13%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
During the year an impairment charge of 97.8m in respect of prior years acquisitions was taken to operating profit.
95m related to City Link and 2.8m to Asia Pacific.
The City Link impairment charge in 2010 was triggered by reduced actual and forecast future cash flows.
Severe weather, weak operational management and continued industry price cutting adversely impacted 2010 cash flows and, although recovery is forecast, they also dampened and pushed back the outlook for future cash flows.
The remaining goodwill balance at 31 December 2010 amounts to 388.9m with 108.1m of this relating to the acquisition of the City Link franchises and Target Express in previous years.
The most significant assumption surrounding the recoverability of this City Link goodwill balance relates to the success of the initiatives implemented to return this business to profitability.
The impairment test assumes operating cash inflows in 2015 of some 23m 1m in 2010 with future years growing at rates consistent with the longer-term growth rates of 2.25% 2009: 2.25% and a pre-tax discount rate of 11.1% 2009: 11.4%.
The remaining goodwill balance of 280.8m is spread across a number of CGUs and no reasonable change in the key assumptions above would give rise to a significant impairment in these businesses.

Customer credit facilities for new customers are approved by designated managers at business level.
Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and reports from credit rating agencies.
Overdue accounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
There were no new customers in 2010 where the group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.
The carrying amounts of the groups trade receivables are denominated in the following currencies: 2010 2009 m m Pounds sterling 111.2 133.8 Euro 188.6 199.5 US dollar 20.4 17.8 Other currencies 54.8 48.1 375.0 399.2 The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included within operating expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other receivables and prepayments do not contain impaired assets.
Other receivables include 21.3m of interest bearing and 1.0m of non-interest bearing notes and deferred consideration received in respect of business disposals.
The notes deferred consideration have final maturities between 2010 and 2014, although earlier repayments may be precipitated under the terms of the respective disposal notes sale agreements.
The interest bearing notes relate to the part disposal of our business in South Africa and are classified as available-for-sale.
The deferred consideration disposal notes are classified as loans and receivables.

Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have been marked as non-hedge.
Any ineffectiveness on the fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges are taken directly to finance costs.
The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of nil 2009: gain of 3.1m note 5.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges or those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship.
The group has 75m and 50m floating LIBOR plus spread to fixed interest rate swaps for which cash flow hedge accounting is applied and whose critical terms match those of the bonds disclosed in note 21.
A charge of 2.6m 2009: 3.6m has been recognised in reserves during the year in respect of the interest rate swaps which are cash flow hedge accounted.
The group has no outstanding forward rate agreements at 31 December 2010 2009: nominal value 200m.
The effective nominal value of foreign exchange swaps is 215.1m 2009: 516.6m and foreign exchange forwards is 46.9m 2009: 30.7m.
Fair value hierarchy of derivative financial instruments For all financial instruments held by the group, those that are held at fair value are to be classified by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The following hierarchy is used: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices: Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The group holds all derivatives at fair value using discounted cash flow models based on market rates which are observable.
Therefore all derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale assets held by the group fall into Level 2.
No financial instruments have moved between levels in the year.

Interest is receivable and payable at rates of interest varying between 0.1% and 4.0%.
Cash Floating rate cash earns interest at commercial rates in line with local market practice.
Central treasury companies invest all significant cash surpluses in major currencies, US$ and euro at money market rates.
Short-term deposits are placed with banks usually for maturities of up to three months and earn interest at market rates related to the currency and the sums invested.

Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments together with other outgoings, after taking into account existing sub-tenant arrangements and assumptions relating to later periods of vacancy.
An additional provision of 29.2m was made in the year in respect of a claim under a lease guarantee given by a subsidiary following the disposal of a business some 20 years ago.
This provision represents the maximum cash outflow in respect of the guarantee discounted over the lease term.
No income from any sub-lease has been assumed in setting this provision.
The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at 31 December 2010 is 3.4m.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next ten years.
Self-insurance The group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks.
The group has historically self-insured its risks but during the latter part of 2008, other than for third party motor liability and workers compensation in the USA and the global property damage business interruption, this practice was stopped and these became fully covered in the insurance market.
Provision is still held for self-insured past cover.
For the continuing self-insured programmes, individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses together with amounts set aside to cover certain legal and regulatory claims.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next five years.
The above provisions have been discounted where appropriate using discount rates of 1.7% to 3.5% 2009: 1.9% to 4.0% for the UK, 2.9% 2009: 3.0% for Europe and 2.9% 2009: 3.8% for the USA.

The cost of borrowing under the RCF at the year end was 0.8995%.
The groups RCF, bank borrowings and bonds are held at amortised cost.
The 300m bond was revalued for changes in interest rates during the period March 2006 to April 2009, during which the group paid floating interest rates.
At the end of this period, the group reverted to paying fixed interest rates and revaluation of the bond ceased as the hedge relationship ended.
The bond is recorded in the financial statements at amortised cost and revaluation differences are amortised to the consolidated income statement over the life of the bond thus producing the effective rate indicated above.

Similarly, the groups businesses do not undertake significant cross-border trade and therefore are not subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk.
Risk management The groups activities expose it to capital risk, liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk.
Capital risk The group is committed to maintaining a debt equity structure which allows continued access to a broad range of financing sources and sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities, in a timely manner as they present themselves, without onerous financing terms and conditions.
The group has in issue Medium Term Notes and a 500m Revolving Credit Facility see note 21 for details.
These contain a single covenant requiring that EBITDA: interest should be at least 4.0:1.0 at each semi-annual reporting date.
The group was compliant throughout the year.
The group targets an investment grade rating of BBB or above for debt insurance over the medium term.
Currently the group is rated BBB with a stable outlook.
The groups Medium Term Notes may be recalled by its investors in the event of a change of control of the group and within 120 days if: a the groups debt is down-graded below investment grade or the rating is withdrawn and b the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or in writing to the issuer or the Trustee that the rating action occurred either wholly or in part due to the change of control.
Liquidity risk The group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due.
To achieve this it aims to maintain minimum committed financing headroom of 200m, over the medium term, when measured against the latest forecast cash flows over a rolling 12 month horizon.
At 31st December 2010 the group had headroom of 390m.
Market risk The group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and the exposure of certain net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
To achieve this, management actively monitors these exposures and the group enters into currency and interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the volatility relating to these.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual report 2010 Financial statements 89 Notes to the accounts i Foreign exchange rate risk The group is exposed to the following foreign exchange risks: Pre-transaction risk, Transaction risk, Translation risk, Economic risk.
The groups policy response is as follows: 1 Pre-transaction risk The majority of sales and purchases are local, limiting pre-transaction risk.
The policy is therefore to accept the risk.
2 Transaction risk The majority of sales and purchases are local, limiting transaction risk.
The policy is therefore to accept the risk, except where significant acquisitions or disposals not internally funded are to be undertaken, where the transaction may be hedged to give certainty of pricing.
3 Translation risk The group is exposed to translation risk as a result of its worldwide operations.
The group aims to hold debt in currencies broadly matching its forecast cash flows, meaning that currency interest costs reduce the net profit retranslation exposure.
This reduces the volatility of earnings affecting the groups interest cover covenant.
Foreign currency debt is designated for hedge accounting as a hedge of its currency net assets, so reducing its net currency assets.
Retranslation gains and losses are recognised in reserves, rather than in the income statement.
4 Economic risk Economic risk is a core risk to the business, which the business therefore accepts and monitors.
The group calculates the impact on the income statement and equity of a 10% shift in foreign exchange rates.
The groups principal foreign currency exposure is to Euro, and a 10% shift in GBP EUR would result in an 8.7m 2009: 8.7m increase decrease in operating profit, offset by a 1.9m 2009: 1.9m increase decrease in interest payable, being interest on the !500m bond which is not hedged to provide a partial natural offset to the operating profit exposure.
For the purposes of IFRS 7, the group is required to disclose the gross impact on the income statement, including any intercompany loans issued from the UK to overseas subsidiaries.
A 10% shift in GBP EUR would result in a 174.3m 2009: 162.4m increase decrease in interest payable, offset by a 172.3m 2009: 160.5m decrease increase in interest payable.
Equity reserves would decrease increase by 5.9m 2009: 17.1m.
ii Interest rate risk The group seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge whilst allowing an element of risk exposure consistent with the variability of the groups cash flows.
The group is required to fix or cap a minimum of 50% of the groups estimated future interest rate exposures excluding pensions for a minimum of 12 months forward.
At the end of December 2010 approximately 89% of the groups debt was at a fixed rate of interest.
Accordingly, the group is not materially exposed to rising interest rates.
The group calculates the impact on profit and loss and equity of a defined interest rate shift.
The same interest rate shift is used for all currencies.
The simulation is run only for liabilities or items in equity that present the major interest-bearing positions.
The impact on profit and loss of a 1% shift would be a maximum increase decrease of 0.6m 2009: 4.1m.
The equity impact of a 1% shift would be a maximum increase decrease of 3.3m 2009: 4.5m.
Credit risk The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Sales are typically low value, high volume, spreading the risk across a number of customers.
Policies are in place to ensure that sales are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure to any single counterparty.
The group monitors the creditworthiness of its derivative counterparties using a combination of credit ratings and other market indicators.
All of the groups banking and derivative counterparties were graded Aor above by Standard and Poors or equivalent at 31 December 2010.
The group operated in some territories where there is increased exposure to trade credit risks and in those cases the group puts in place appropriate additional measures to manage its credit exposure.
Treasury risk The company utilises financial instruments to manage known financial exposures in line with policies agreed by the board and outlined above.
The company does not enter into any speculative derivative contracts.

Of the losses, 70.0m will expire at various dates between 2011 and 2030.
In addition, there are capital losses carried forward of 287.7m 2009: 287.7m on which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Other deferred tax assets relating to gross temporary timing differences of 23.9m 2009: 42.3m have not been recognised due to the uncertainty regarding their utilisation.
The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% has had no material impact on the deferred tax position.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the United Kingdom, which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants other than the Initial No 2 Section, accounting for 0.5% of the total schemes liabilities, which remains open.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are usually carried out every three years.
The most recent full valuation was at 31 March 2007.
The 2010 valuation is in progress and the company has commenced discussions with the Pension Trustees in relation to any funding implications arising from this.
These defined benefit schemes are reappraised bi-annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The principal assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2010 2009 Weighted average % Discount rate 5.4% 5.7% Expected return on plan assets 5.7% 6.0% Future salary increases 4.4% 4.5% Future pension increases 3.5% 3.5% 1 RPI Inflation 3.7% 3.8% 1 CPI Inflation 3.0% N A 1 in 2010, CPI rather than RPI was used for calculating certain future pension increases, resulting in a credit of 35.0m in respect of a change in pension liabilities The expected return on plan assets in the above table is a long-term rate of return.
Assets with higher historic volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected return for each asset class over the benchmark asset allocation for the scheme at 31 December 2010, less an appropriate allowance for the cost of maintaining the swap portfolio.
Mortality assumptions At 31 December 2010, standard tables PNMA00 and PNFA00 projected, based on the year of the members birth using the PA92 series Medium Cohort projection factors incorporating underpins to annual improvements in mortality rates of 1.0% for males and 0.5% for females.
The mortality rates are scaled by a factor of 130% for non-executive members and by 85% for executive members.
This equates to a man aged 65 living for a further 20.1 years if he is a non-executive member and for a further 23.6 years if he is an executive member.
The corresponding figures for a woman are 22.2 and 25.5 years respectively.
The same assumptions were adopted at 31 December 2009.

Share-based payments The company has share option schemes for approximately 500 senior executives worldwide.
The exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
Share options are equity settled.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 6.0m 2009: 5.1m.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary Schemes the Discretionary Schemes are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the company.
There are two levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes.
Level 1 applies to all senior executives including executive directors, Level 2 and deferred share schemes apply to executive directors and sector managing directors.
They are summarised as follows: Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in the group of support services companies.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows: Weighted average Number exercise of share price options p per share 000 Outstanding at 1 January 2009 190.078 12,807 Expired 189.407 5,565 Outstanding at 31 December 2009 190.593 7,242 Expired 167.263 1,949 Outstanding at 31 December 2010 199.184 5,293 No options were exercised during the period.

The 2007 grants lapsed at the end of 2010 with the performance criteria not being met.
Number Number Vesting 31 December 31 December Year of Grant Year 2009 Granted Lapsed 2010 2007 2010 6,176,424 6,176,424 2008 2011 7,527,489 791,623 6,735,866 2009 2012 11,703,753 1,584,476 10,119,277 2010 2013 10,151,534 10,151,534 The performance conditions for the 2008 awards are share price and the financial performance bonus multiplier of the group, division or business whichever is applicable to the award holder.
The share price condition is based on the highest average share price of Rentokil Initial plc over any 60 consecutive dealing days during the initial three-year period.
The performance period for the share price element of the award began on 1 April 2008 and ends 61 dealing days following the announcement of the companys results for the financial year ending 31 December 2010.
The annual bonus multiplier measures the extent to which the annual bonus targets have been achieved in respect of each financial year during the performance period.
The 2008 awards in the above table assume an on target share price of 180p per share is reached at the end of the vesting period and that participants achieve their target bonus in each of the three years over the vesting period.
No shares will vest if the share price does not reach 120p per share at the end of the vesting period and 200% will vest if the share price reaches 180p per share and all participants attain maximum of their bonus targets.
Participants are entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The performance conditions for the 2009 and 2010 awards are total shareholder return TSR and the financial performance bonus multiplier of the group, division or business whichever is applicable to the award holder.
The TSR condition is measured relative to the TSR achieved by constituents of a comparator group, made up of the FTSE 350 companies at the date of grant but excluding financial services and basic resources companies.
The performance period for the share price element of the 2010 award began on 1 April 2010, running to 31 March 2013.
The TSR performance is measured using a three-month average with the start period average being 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2010 and the end period average being 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2013.
The 2009 and 2010 awards in the above table assume a TSR performance in the upper quartile or above is reached at the end of the vesting period and that participants achieve their target bonus in each of the three years over the vesting period.
No shares will vest if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the vesting period and 200% will vest if the TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain maximum bonus targets.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual report 2010 96 Notes to the accounts The fair value of the 2010 awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a model developed by Deloitte LLP.
This is a closed-form solution similar to a Monte Carlo simulation which takes account of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met.
The significant inputs into the model were a share price of 127.7p 2009: 88.5p, an expected share price volatility of 41.7%, a share price correlation of the companies in the comparator group of 28% and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices.
Given the significant volatility of share prices observed over an historic period, an average three-year volatility figure over the three years to the date of grant has been used to determine the historic long-term trend, and this has been taken as a benchmark for the expected share price volatility over the term of the awards.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting period.
The fair value of shares granted during 2010 was 8.9m 2009: 7.0m.
Executive Share Plan In 2008 the company also introduced a long-term incentive plan for the chairman, chief executive and one other executive director and granted 22,500,000 shares during the year.
Number Number Exercise 31 December 31 December Year of Grant period 2009 Granted Lapsed 2010 2008 20112013 22,500,000 22,500,000 The performance condition for the award is share price and will only be satisfied if the share price target is achieved over a sustained period, demonstrating realisable value creation for shareholders.
This will be measured on the basis of an average share price over any 60 consecutive trading days during the performance measurement period.
Until a minimum share price of 120p per share has been met over a sustained period, no shares will be earned.
At 120p per share, 20% of the award would be earned, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting at a share price of 180p per share.
For achieving growth in market value between a share price of 180p per share and 280p per share further shares may be earned up to a maximum of a further 50% of the original award.
The 2008 awards in the same table assume an on target share price of 180p per share is reached at the end of the vesting period.
Up to 1 3 of the award may vest following the end of the third year, another 1 3 following the end of the fourth year and a further 1 3 following the end of the fifth year, based on the extent to which performance targets are achieved.
Any unvested portion of the award following the end of the fifth year will lapse.
See the remuneration report on pages 40 to 47 for further details.
The fair value of the 2008 awards made under the Rentokil Initial 2008 Executive Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a bespoke Monte Carlo simulation model.
The significant inputs into the model were a share price of 102p, an expected share price volatility of 21%, an expected dividend yield of 5% per annum and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices measured until October 2007 therefore excluding the significant volatility during the last months of 2007, which the company would not expect going forward.
During the first half of 2010 the companys share price achieved a 60 day highest average price of 130.82 pence and therefore under the terms of the plan it is expected that 34.43% of the award will vest with participants being entitled to receive a third of the award from May 2011, a second third a year later and the balance in May 2013.
Additional amounts can be earned based on share price appreciation beyond the 130.82 pence level during the remaining life of the scheme.
