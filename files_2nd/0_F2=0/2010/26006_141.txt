Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is subject to a number of financial risks throughout its business, being market risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board is accountable for risk and is responsible for oversight of the risk management process.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the risk strategy of the Group and for determining an appropriate risk appetite and tolerance levels within which the Group must operate.
By defining these, the Board demonstrates that it is aware of and, where appropriate, has taken steps to mitigate the impact of risks that may have a material impact on the Group.
The Executive Committee reviews the key corporate risks facing the Group.
The Chief Financial Officer has responsibility for the risk and control framework within the Group and the independent monitoring and reporting of risk and controls.
The Chief Financial Officer through a Risk Committee manages the ongoing development of the Groups risk and control framework.
Jupiter embeds risk management within the business, with independent oversight and challenge being provided by the risk function.
Market price risk Group Market price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets will adversely impact the profitability of the Group.
Management has identified price risk as the exposure in the value of financial assets held by the Group, resulting in a loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.

Financial risk management continued The Group holds equity investments in its seed capital portfolio and is exposed to the risk of changes in the equity markets that will reduce the value of the Groups investments.
At 31 December 2010, the exposure to unlisted equity securities at fair value was 20.2m 2009: 13.2m and the exposure to securities at fair value was 58.9m 2009: 50.9m.
The Groups policy is to hedge the equity market and currency exposure of its seed capital investments depending on the fund mandate and whether such transactions available are cost effective.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group has a total return swap arrangement over certain of its holdings in seed fund investment.
The notional value of the swap was 38.7m 2009: 40.3m.
See the financial instruments note.
A fall in value of an available for sale investment which is significant or prolonged is considered to be an indication of impairment under IAS 39.
In such an event, the available for sale investment is written down to fair value and the amounts of previously recognised equity, in respect of market value are recognised in the consolidated income statement as an impairment charge.
There was no market price risk for the Company.
Price risk sensitivity analysis on financial assets The Group estimates an increase or decrease of 10 per cent.
on the market index FTSE All share applied to the Groups financial assets would have the following impact on the profit before taxation and equity of the Group: Market value movement - 10% Consolidated income statement Equity m m 31 December 2009 1.1 1.1 31 December 2010 2.0 2.0 The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
As the Group predominately operates in the UK with some transactions from overseas third parties in foreign currencies, this then impacts its exposure to non-sterling income and expenses.
The Groups policy is to hold minimum currency to cover operational needs and therefore to convert foreign currency on receipt.
Direct exposures are limited to operational cash held in overseas subsidiaries and short term outstanding currency fee debts at any time.
The Group does not normally hedge this risk.
Foreign currency risk is managed by the finance function incorporating treasury operations, whereby foreign currency balances are monitored closely.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from the fair value or future cash flow of adverse movements in interest bearing assets and liabilities and so reduce profitability.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long term debt obligations with floating interest rates see loans and borrowings note.
Cash held by the operating companies are held in fixed rates for no longer than three months.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a combination of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
As explained further in the loans and borrowings note, the Group has entered into swap arrangements to effectively fix the rate payable on a portion of its variable debt.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
In such circumstances, the Group raises long term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
At 31 December 2010, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 25 per cent.
of the Groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest 2009: 59 per cent..
The Group is also exposed to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
The Groups finance function monitors the Groups interest rate cash flow risks and returns.
The Company did not have any liabilities for which interest was accruing in 2010.
In 2009, the Company had fixed rate borrowings which were subsequently repaid in 2010.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to a financial loss in its operating activities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily for trade receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments.
Fee receivables arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets see the trade and other receivables note.
Trade and other receivables that are past due are not considered to be impaired.

Financial risk management continued With regard to credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits, the Groups policy is to place deposits only with financial institutions, which satisfy minimum ratings and other criteria set by the Balance Sheet Management Committee.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The Risk Committee monitors the Groups counterparty exposures.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in the cash and cash equivalents note and in the trade and other receivables note.

Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due or at a significantly higher cost.
The Group produces a cash flow forecast to ensure all assets and liabilities are managed efficiently.
The Groups objectives are: ensuring both the Group as a whole and individual entities within the Group have access to sufficient liquid funds to trade solvently and meet trading liabilities as they fall due: allowing the Group to maintain a flexible dividend policy, taking reference to prior year and prospective profitability, cash flow and balance sheet: and providing the Group with appropriate flexibility over the transferability of its capital and cash balances.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balance required for working capital management is held in interest bearing deposits of up to 90 days and the regulated companies in particular ensure that, sufficient capital is kept to meet regulatory requirements.
The Group currently has access to a revolving credit facility of 10m 2009: 10m which is unutilised.

The subsidiaries within the Group which are regulated are required to maintain liquid capital resources to comply with the regulatory capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority and other global financial regulators.
All regulated entities within the Group complied with the externally imposed regulatory capital requirement.
In addition to the capital held to meet the regulatory capital requirements, the Group maintains sufficient cash resources to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due, taking into account cash forecasts.
The Group performs regular cash flow forecasts, modelling both normal and stressed conditions.
Liquidity risk is mitigated by the long-term nature of the Groups principal borrowings and the high levels of cash balances in the business.
