com Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Significant accounting policies General information Victrex plc the Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its Registered Office is Victrex Technology Centre, Hillhouse International, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, FY5 4QD, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 6 December 2010.
Basis of preparation Both the consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU endorsed IFRS and on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value.
The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Business Review on pages 4 to 20.
In addition, note 15 on financial risk management details the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks, including currency and credit risk.
The Group has significant positive cash balances and has a committed bank facility of 40m which expires in 2012.
This facility was undrawn at 30 September 2010 and remained undrawn at 6 December 2010 when these consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors.
Based on the above and a review of the Groups budgets and forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of section 408 Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the approved financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with endorsed IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Details of significant estimates and assumptions are set out in note 24.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 43 A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards were effective for the financial year ended 30 September 2010.
The effect of adopting the new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which were mandatory for the first time for the year ended 30 September 2010 was as follows: As a result of the adoption of IAS 1 Revised, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense has been replaced with the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity is now presented separately as a primary statement: The amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations was adopted.
The principal effect of this amendment is that when an award to an employee under a share option scheme lapses due to cancellation of the scheme then the full cost of the award will be expensed in the period in which the option lapses.
The amendment also stipulates that an individual ceasing to pay contributions is classed as a cancellation, unless a replacement award is issued.
Under the previous interpretation the lapsing of the award through employee cancellation would have resulted in the fair value of the option charged to date being reversed in the income statement.
The amendment to IFRS 2 affects the Groups Save as You Earn SAYE schemes.
This interpretation is required to be applied fully retrospectively.
The implementation of the interpretation has had no material impact on either the current or prior year financial statements: During the period IFRS 8 Operating Segments was adopted.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified and reported upon that are consistent with the level at which results are regularly reviewed by the entitys chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker for the Group is the Victrex plc Board.
In February 2009 the Groups business was strategically reorganised into two divisions: Victrex Polymer Solutions VPS and Invibio Biomaterial Solutions Invibio.
VPS manufactures high performance thermoplastic polymers for customers in the transport, industrial and electronics markets.
Invibio is the provider of biocompatible PEEK based polymers to medical device manufacturers.
Divisional information is the primary basis on which information is reported to the Victrex plc Board and as such the segmental information in note 2 reflects this divisional structure.
The performance of the divisions is assessed based on segmental operating profit: and IFRS 7 revised Financial Instruments: Disclosures was adopted.
Accordingly, disclosure is given regarding the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair values of the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are categorised and the maturity analysis required in relation to the timing of cash flows.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued during the period and endorsed by the EU, but which are not yet effective and accordingly the Group has not yet adopted.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not expected to be significant.
Effective for the Groups financial year ending 30 September 2011: Improvements to IFRSs 2009: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Amendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Amendment to IAS 17 Leases: Amendment to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Amendments to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations: and Amendments to IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

Amendments to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on Defined Benefit Assets, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Effective for the Groups financial year ending 30 September 2014: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing control.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Segment reporting During the year the Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Divisional information is the primary basis of information reported to the Victrex plc Board and this is reflected in the segmental information in note 2.
The performance of the divisions is assessed based on segmental operating profit.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operated the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 45 Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which have the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates: and All resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment Owned assets All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Financial Statements 46 Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 www.
Significant accounting policies continued Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 30 years Plant and machinery 1030 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 years Computers and motor vehicles 35 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Should any impairment provisions arise during annual impairment testing, these would also be deducted from the carrying value of other intangible assets.
Other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, to the extent that they are considered to have an indefinite useful economic life.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis in order to allocate the cost over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Knowhow 10 years The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 47 Impairment The carrying amount of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and current and deferred tax, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amounts of the relevant assets are determined.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit CGU, discounted to their present value using risk adjusted discount factors to give its value in use.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated exceeds its value in use and are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit or group of units on a pro-rata basis.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Other assets For other assets subject to impairment reviews, an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Income tax Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Financial Statements 48 Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 www.
Significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the amounts receivable for the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods.
Rebates are accounted for as sales are made throughout the period.
Volume rebates are accrued based on the maximum amount due to customers based on annualised sales, unless it is clear that rebate conditions will not be met in a particular period.
Employee benefits Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs not yet recognised.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in profit or loss.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 49 Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of comprehensive income as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payment transactions The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefitting from the service of the employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the parents share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or Total Shareholder Return, would not result in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and it has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
Net financing income and expense Net financing income and expense comprises interest payable on borrowings, interest received on funds invested and charges on bank loans and overdrafts.

Property, plant and equipment continued Leased property, plant and equipment There are no finance lease agreements for either the Group or Company.
Operating lease rentals of 1,195,000 2009: 1,326,000 relating to the lease of property, plant and equipment are included in the income statement see note 3.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is allocated to the cash generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management.
For the periods beyond the budget, cash flows are extrapolated using long-term growth rates.
Other assumptions such as market share and changes to selling prices are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the market.
The goodwill of 10,110,000 is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of our Victrex Polymer Solutions division.
The long-term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2009: 2.5% and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate was 7.5% 2009: 8%.
The impairment test results in more than 100% headroom and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Knowhow The knowhow arose on the acquisition in December 1999 associated with the supply of our key raw material BDF.
It has been fully amortised.
The charge has been recognised within cost of sales in the income statement.

Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including the following: Currency risk Company Victrex plc is an investment holding company and is not exposed to currency risk.
The Company has no forward exchange contracts.
Group The Group currently exports 98% of sales from the UK, and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average sterling US Dollar, sterling Euro and sterling Yen rates on profit for 2010 is 3.1m, 2.9m and 0.6m 2009: 1.9m, 1.4m and 0.3m respectively.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average sterling US Dollar, sterling Euro and sterling Yen rates on equity for 2010 is 1.3m, 0.4m and 0.4m 2009: 0.9m, 0.3m and 0.3m respectively.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group hedges a proportion of sales, and occasionally purchases, denominated in a foreign currency.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 26.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps are as follows: Carrying Carrying Notional amount Notional amount contract and contract and amount fair value amount fair value 2010 2010 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 Current assets 80,194 2,240 9,010 1,702 Current liabilities 50,700 2,269 76,389 6,303 130,894 29 85,399 4,601 18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 57 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
These are categorised as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The following tables indicate the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts for which hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur: Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash flows or less months months cash flows or less months months 2010 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward exchange contracts Assets 78,653 35,899 36,985 5,769 10,762 2,923 7,839 Liabilities 51,700 27,583 24,117 73,412 36,477 32,392 4,543 130,353 63,482 61,102 5,769 84,174 39,400 40,231 4,543 The following tables indicate the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts for which no hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur: Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash flows or less months months cash flows or less months months 2010 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward exchange contracts Assets 1,541 1,541 1,752 2,261 509 Liabilities 1,000 1,000 2,977 2,977 541 541 1,225 716 509 Any change in the fair value of these items is recognised in the income statement.
Gains and losses deferred in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2010 will be recognised in the income statement during the period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
At 30 September 2010, there are a number of hedged foreign currency transactions which are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months.
During the year, 185,000 relating to forward exchange contracts on the balance sheet at 30 September 2010 was released to the income statement 2009: 2,306,000.

Financial risk management continued Credit risk Company The only trade receivables of the Company are amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings.
Group The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Board approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular due consideration of credit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
The Board receives a detailed breakdown every month of all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue across the Group and, in the case of the latter, the relevant action being taken.
Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Amounts neither past due nor impaired 15,698 12,301 Amounts past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days 2,021 1,715 3060 days 145 132 More than 60 days 66 150 Total past due but not impaired 2,232 1,997 Amounts impaired 350 385 Impairment allowances 350 385 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 17,930 14,298 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.
Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2010 2009 000 000 At beginning of year 385 663 Charge release in the year 18 287 Utilisation of provision 58 Exchange adjustments 5 9 At end of year 350 385 Amounts receivable from the Groups major customer are not considered to pose a significant credit risk based on historic payment behaviour, strict credit terms and the customers size and strength.
The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established, international banks.
As at 30 September 2010, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 24.2m 2009: 6.7m for the Group.
At 30 September 2010, the mark to market exposure on forward foreign exchange contracts was a net gain position of 0.1m with any single bank.
At the prior financial year end, there was a net financial liability position with each bank.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 59 Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available in order to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has a committed bank facility of 40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
This facility was renewed in 2007 and expires in September 2012.
As at 30 September 2010 the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 77,271,000.
Interest rate risk The Group had no short-term borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Although the Group does hold substantial cash balances, its exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be significant.
Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Any increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree of control over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
The Groups policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future development and growth of the business.
The Board regularly reviews the Groups capital structure and when deemed necessary may take action to adjust it.
This was demonstrated by the Directors recommendation of payment in February 2011 of a special dividend to shareholders in addition to the final dividend for the year ended September 2010.
The Board do not expect to make significant share repurchases in 2011, although there is a resolution proposed at each Annual General Meeting AGM to authorise the Company to make one or more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum number of shares equal to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM notice.

For trade and other payables there are no amounts due after one year, the majority falling due in 30 days or less.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
The majority of schemes outside the UK are defined contribution.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which certain employees of subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.

Each year executive Directors were eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 100% of basic salary.
The awards have normally become exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment and the Groups performance over the three year period commencing at the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
The extent to which an award has been exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : The TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 12.5% on a pro rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no shares will vest under this performance condition unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group over the relevant performance period: and The EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 10% on a pro rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.

Each year executive Directors are eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 150% of basic salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, this limit is increased to 200% of an employees annual base salary.
Awards normally vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions see below have been satisfied and provided the participant is still employed in the Companys Group.
Participants will have a five year period from the date each tranche vests in which to exercise awards structured as nil or nominal cost options.
Participants will receive a payment in cash and or shares on or shortly following the vesting of their awards, of an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on those shares between the time when the awards were granted and the time when they vest.
Alternatively, participants may have their awards increased as if dividends were paid on the shares subject to their award and then reinvested in further shares.
The extent to which an award will be exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : The TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.

Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Group hedging policy is to defer the impact on profits of currency movements by hedging a proportion of projected transaction exposures.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
These forward contracts are entered into on the basis of forecasts of future trading and the valuation of these contracts is calculated using forward exchange market rates.
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Group policy.
The valuation is prepared by independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied, investment returns and member longevity which underpin the valuations.
Note 16 contains information about the assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 71 The charge for share-based payment transactions is calculated in accordance with Group policy.
The option valuation models used require subjective assumptions to be made including the future volatility of the Groups share price, expected dividend yields, risk-free interest rates and expected staff turnover.
The Directors draw upon a variety of external sources to aid the determination of the appropriate data to use in such calculations.
Note 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to share-based payment transactions.
In relation to the Companys property, plant and equipment, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to a potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets.
No circumstances have been identified to suggest that this is the case.
Goodwill is reviewed annually to assess the requirement for impairment.
Other intangible assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable.
Impairment testing on goodwill is carried out as described in note 10.
Such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in particular markets as well as short-term business performance.
The Directors also draw upon experience in making these judgements.
Note 10 contains information about the assumptions relating to impairment testing.
