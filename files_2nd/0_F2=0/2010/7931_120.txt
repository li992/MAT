Financial Instruments Non-derivative financial assets are classified as cash and debtors.
Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For interest-bearing assets, the carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
