Accounting estimates and judgements Key sources of estimation uncertainty Fair values of financial instruments Many of the groups financial instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and it is usually possible to determine their fair values within a reasonable range of estimates.
For the majority of the groups financial instruments, quoted market prices are readily available.
However, certain financial instruments, such as unquoted securities, are fair valued using valuation techniques, including reference to the current fair values of instruments that are substantially the same subject to the appropriate adjustments.
Fair value estimates are made at a speci c point in time, based on market conditions and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of signi cant judgement e. g. interest rates, volatility, estimated cash ows, etc and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
