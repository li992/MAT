SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2010 89 30 Risk borrowings and risk and volatility for shareholders.
There can therefore be no assurance as to whether, and if so how much, the value ofthe Companys assets will grow or the timing of return if any.
Investments in buy-out and development capital funds may be difficult to value and dispositions may require a lengthy time period since there is only alimited market for secondary sales of private equity investments.
Further, sales or other transfers of interests in buy-out and development capital funds sometimes require the written consent of the general partner of the fund, the granting of which is at its discretion.
Accordingly, the Group may not be able to sell its investments in buy-out and development capital funds at their net asset value.
The Companys portfolio is concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers as explained below and this may impact the ability to place alarge holding of a single fund on the secondary market at any one time.
Portfolio company risks Since the Company invests through private equity funds in portfolio companies, the risks experienced by the portfolio companies will closely affect thereturns earned by the Company and the trading price and value of its Ordinary Shares.
The risks which the portfolio companies may experience, and the risks posed by an investment in such companies, include: these companies may be highly leveraged and subject to significant debt service obligations, stringent operating and financial covenants and a higher risk of default under financing and other contractual arrangements, which would lead to severe adverse consequences for the relevant portfolio company and the value of the Companys investment in such company if a default were to occur: the valuations of highly leveraged companies are typically more sensitive to changes in value in public company comparable earnings multiples, declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.
The risk of loss associated with a highly leveraged company is generally far greater than for companies with comparatively less debt: they may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt facilities, or to refinance debt facilities when they fall due, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities in which the Company is ultimately invested: they may require significant additional capital investment or operational or management support to improve their operations, finance expansions ormaintain their competitive positions.
Such investment and support may not be forthcoming: often, little public information exists about these companies and investors in these companies generally must rely on information obtained by the general partner, or other manager, of the relevant fund which holds the portfolio company: reliance is placed on the general partner as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during any due diligence exercise conducted prior to an investment being made.
The general partner, or relevant manager, of the fund in question may have made judgments concerning the materiality of contingent or actual risks or liabilities identified during due diligence that may not in practice turn out to have been accurate: the purchase agreements relating to the investment in question may contain only limited representations and warranties from the relevant vendors and these may be limited in, for example, time and amount.
Such contractual protection would typically not be addressed to the Company directly and, in any case, there can be no assurance as to the ability of the relevant vendor to satisfy any claims which may be made under any such agreement: general operating risks arising from or being, amongst other matters, the cost of goods and services, difficulty in obtaining customers, losses arising from customer failure, market developments, competition risk, key man risk, foreign exchange risk, financing risks, an increase in costs and the legal and regulatory framework within which the portfolio company operates: there are likely to be prior claims on the assets of portfolio companies from debt providers which would reduce the amounts earned by the equity holders including, indirectly, the Company: and lenders to portfolio companies may take actions which are adverse to the interests of the holders of equity interests in the portfolio company including, indirectly, the Company.
The value of the portfolio companies held by the funds in which the Company holds interests may be affected by uncertainties, such as political developments, changes in government policies, regulations, laws, taxation, currency fluctuations, currency repatriation and other restrictions, in some of the countries in which the funds may invest.
The Company, directly or indirectly through the funds in which the Company holds interests, may also be exposed to these risks.
Passive investor with limited recourse The Company is generally a passive investor and has limited powers under the governing documents of the funds in which it holds interests.
The funds concerned are, within certain broad parameters, generally authorised to follow broad investment guidelines and, subject thereto, are able to invest in geographies, industries and investment opportunities at their discretion.
The Company does not review each proposed investment and is, subject to certain limited exceptions, unable to refuse to meet a Call without suffering the consequences of a default.
There can be no assurance that the strategies adopted by Permira or other general partners or managers of the funds in which the Company holds interests will be successful or that the portfolio companies of such funds, or the Companys investments generally, will appreciate in value.
The Company also holds some investments in funds in respect of which other members of the Group are the general partner, manager and or adviser.
In these instances, fiduciary duties are owed by the relevant members of the Group to other investors which, together with the terms of the relevant fund management or advisory agreement, mean that the relevant members of the Group are unable to submit each proposed investment for review by the Company which will, therefore, remain a passive investor in respect of the relevant fund.
The Company cannot make claims against general partners or managers of the funds in which the Company invests even in cases of poor performance except in very limited circumstances typically involving severe culpability on the part of the general partner or manager.
The Companys recourse in the event of poor performance of the funds concerned is highly restricted.
Removal of the general partner or manager of a fund generally requires a high level of investor participation and consent with the relevant threshold often being set so as to require the consent of holders of 75% of the capital committed to the fund in question.
The Company is unlikely to be able to procure such participation and consent on its own and it may Financial information
