This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This disclosure only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.
Effect on Effect on profit profit 2010 2009 m m Assumptions Long-term insurance business Interest rates 796 363 Expenses 1 69 Persistency rates 2 Mortality for assurance contracts 71 11 Mortality for annuity contracts 637 6 Tax and other assumptions 167 49 Investment contracts Interest rates 1 20 Expenses 1 40 Persistency rates 21 Tax and other assumptions 3 89 General insurance and health business Change in loss ratio assumptions 4 2 Change in discount rate assumptions 61 57 Change in expense ratio and other assumptions 38 21 Total 1,243 321 The impact of interest rates for long-term business relates primarily to the UK driven by the reduction in interest rates.
This had the effect of increasing liabilities and hence a negative impact on profit.
The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
The impact of mortality for annuity contracts relates to the exceptional strengthening in the Netherlands, following the publication of new mortality tables, and to smaller changes in the UK.
Other assumptions relate mainly to the move to realistic reserving in Ireland, which reduced insurance liabilities, and changes in the UK.
