We expect production in 2011 to be lower than in 2010 as a result of divestments, lower production from the Gulf of Mexico and increased turnaround activity to improve the long-term reliability of the assets.
As a result of these factors, reported production in 2011 is expected to be around 3,400mboe d. The actual outcome will depend on the exact timing of divestments, the pace of resumption of operations in the Gulf of Mexico, OPEC quotas and the impact of the oil price on our PSAs.
In Refining and Marketing, refiners are likely to continue to operate with excess capacity globally, although near-term supply-demand fundamentals appear broadly in balance.
We expect the number and cost of our refinery turnarounds in 2011 and 2012 to be higher than in 2010.
In Other businesses and corporate, the underlying average quarterly charge for 2011 is expected to be around $400 million.
As in previous years, this is likely to be volatile on an individual quarterly basis.
We expect capital expenditure, excluding acquisitions and asset exchanges, to be around $20 billion in 2011, an increase compared with 2010.
Having received a total of $17 billion for disposal proceeds and disposal deposits in 2010, we are targeting around a further $13 billion in 2011.
