Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 copebrs Oxide Ore reserves: The decrease is attributable equally to production and a redesign of the pit which resulted in 5.6Mt of Ore Reserves being re-allocated to Mineral Resources due to changes in economic assumptions.
The decrease was partially offset by a gain of 1.4Mt Ore Reserves following completion of an infill drilling campaign within Area 5 that has revealed mineralisation that extends to greater depth than originally considered.
2 copebrs Oxide Mineral resources: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 7% P O cut-off and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.4.
The decrease is a result of a transfer of 115 Mt of Mineral Resources, 2 5 2 5 located within the Catalo II Complex and reported in 2009 under Copebrs to the Coqueiros Project: New resource modelling added 64 Mt to the Mineral Resources, principally from the southern part of FFG04, Area 5 and the Gomides Area.
3 coqueiros: The Mineral Resources previously reported under Copebrs represent the MCG-03 area only and exclude the adjacent MCG-02 area which still requires additional work to be carried out before presentation to Brazils Departamento Nacional fide Produo Mineral DNPM.
The Oxide mineralisation is defined by a cut-off grade of 7% P O and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.4.
The Fresh Rock 2 5 2 5 resources are defined by a cut-off grade of 5% P O.
The metallurgical recovery characteristics of the Fresh Rock appear superior to those of the oxidised materials, permitting the application of a lower 2 5 cut-off grade.
