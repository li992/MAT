Warning to Shareholders Shareholders should be wary of unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning the Company and offering investment advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or free company reports.
It is extremely unlikely that The City of London Investment Trust plc, its Manager Henderson Global Investors or its Registrar Computershare Investor Services would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders.
In the event that the Company or its advisers did make unsolicited calls, shareholders would never be asked to confirm their personal details and such calls would relate only to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never be in respect of offering investment advice, or unpublished investment or financial information regarding the Company.
If you are in any doubt about the veracity of an unsolicited phone call, please call the Company Secretary at the telephone number provided on the inside back cover.
