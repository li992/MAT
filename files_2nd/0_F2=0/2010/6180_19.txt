notes on the Accounts 1. seGment InformAtIon The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit before interest and tax.
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three business segments: 1 Port operations: 2 Recycling: and 3 Property The segment results for the year ended 31st December 2010 were as follows: Group Port Total Operations Recycling Property 2010 m m m m Total revenue 157.4 15.7 8.8 181.9 Underlying operating profit before exceptional items and revaluations 43.0 1.1 5.7 49.8 Exceptional items and revaluations Write-back of asset impairment 0.4 0.4 Rule 2.4 costs in respect of approach from the Consortium 1.1 1.1 Change in fair value of investment properties 16.8 3.6 20.4 16.1 3.6 19.7 Operating profit segment result 59.1 1.1 9.3 69.5 Finance income Note 7 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.2 Finance costs Note 8 5.8 1.6 7.4 14.8 Share of operating results of associate Operating profit 2.2 2.2 Finance costs 0.3 0.3 Taxation 0.5 0.5 Net share of results of associate 1.4 1.4 Profit loss before tax 54.9 0.5 1.9 56.3 Taxation normal 9.4 exceptional 1.8 Profit for the year 45.1 Total revenue and underlying operating profit are shown net of Port inter-segment trading of 1.4m with Recycling and 0.4m with Property Underlying is defined in Note 4 to the Glossary 62 The segment results for the year ended 31st December 2009 were as follows: Group Port Total Operations Recycling Property 2009 m m m m Total revenue 154.8 17.6 1.5 173.9 Underlying operating profit loss before exceptional items and revaluations 41.5 1.3 0.6 42.2 Exceptional items and revaluations Charge for impairment of goodwill 12.3 12.3 Change in fair value of investment properties 10.5 0.1 10.4 10.5 12.3 0.1 1.9 Operating profit loss segment result 52.0 11.0 0.7 40.3 Finance income Note 7 0.3 0.0 0.6 0.9 Finance costs Note 8 6.4 1.6 3.5 11.5 Acquisition accounting adjustment Note 39 18.3 18.3 Share of operating results of joint ventures Operating profit 2.9 2.9 Revaluation 2.6 2.6 Finance costs 2.0 2.0 Taxation Net share of results of joint ventures 1.7 1.7 Share of operating results of associate Operating profit 1.3 1.3 Finance costs 0.3 0.3 Taxation 0.3 0.3 Net share of results of associate 0.7 0.7 Profit loss before tax 46.6 12.6 13.0 47.0 7.7 Taxation normal exceptional 2.2 Profit for the year 37.1 Inter-segment transfers and transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.

The change from 28% to 27% was enacted at the balance sheet date and has, therefore, been included in these accounts.
The effect of the reduction to 27% has been to reduce the deferred tax asset recognised at 31st December 2010 by 0.3m, from 8.2m to 7.9m, and to reduce the deferred tax liability by 2.2m, from 61.4m to 59.2m.
The 1.9m net decrease in the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability has increased profits for the period by 1.8m and increased other comprehensive income by 0.1m.
The proposed reductions in the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 24% are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of a further reduction to 24%, if applied to the deferred tax balances at 31st December, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by approximately 0.9m being 0.3m recognised in each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, and to reduce the deferred tax liability by 6.6m being 2.2m recognised in each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013.

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these accounts.
12. eArnInGs per shAre Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share in 2010, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees under a SAYE share option scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the LTIP schemes.
In 2009, the options granted under the SAYE Scheme were non-dilutive as the option price exceeded the average share price for the year.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2010 2009 Weighted Weighted Average Earnings Average Earnings Number of per Number of per Earnings Shares Share Earnings Shares Share Continuing operations m 000 Pence m 000 Pence Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 45.0 37.2 Total shares issued 45,728 45,646 Shares held by ESOP Trust 1 96 Basic EPS 45.0 45,727 98.4 37.2 45,550 81.7 Effect of dilutive securities share options 545 439 Diluted EPS 45.0 46,272 97.3 37.2 45,989 80.9 Share of profit attributable to equity holders of the Company before exceptional items and revaluations 27.1 25.6 Underlying EPS 27.1 45,727 59.3 25.6 45,550 56.2 Revised for measurement period adjustment Note 39 Forth Ports Annual Report and Accounts 2010 69 notes on the Accounts Continued 13. property, pLAnt And equIpment Operational Capital Land and Plant and Works in Buildings Equipment Progress Total m m m m Group Cost net of capital grants At 1st January 2010 251.2 127.3 15.3 393.8 Additions 0.3 1.2 4.3 5.8 Disposals 0.5 1.6 2.1 Transfers between asset categories 1.5 1.3 3.8 1.0 At 31st December 2010 252.5 128.2 15.8 396.5 Accumulated depreciation net of grant amortisation At 1st January 2010 109.6 72.8 182.4 Depreciation charge net of grant amortisation 7.1 6.9 14.0 Impairment reversal 0.2 0.2 0.4 Disposals 0.5 1.6 2.1 Transfers between asset categories 0.3 0.0 0.3 At 31st December 2010 115.7 77.9 193.6 Net book value at 31st December 2010 136.8 50.3 15.8 202.9 Group Cost net of capital grants At 1st January 2009 247.7 125.9 18.2 391.8 Acquired on purchase of subsidiary 0.0 0.0 Additions 1.4 0.8 3.3 5.5 Disposals 0.1 3.3 3.4 Transfers between asset categories 2.2 3.9 6.2 0.1 At 31st December 2009 251.2 127.3 15.3 393.8 Accumulated depreciation net of grant amortisation At 1st January 2009 103.0 69.5 172.5 Depreciation charge net of grant amortisation 6.8 6.6 13.4 Disposals 0.1 3.3 3.4 0.1 Transfers between asset categories 0.1 At 31st December 2009 109.6 72.8 182.4 Net book value at 31st December 2009 141.6 54.5 15.3 211.4 The Directors are of the opinion that there is no material difference between the net book value of operational land and buildings above and their fair value in existing use.

Deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of investment property.
The Groups investment properties were valued at 31st December 2010 by DTZ, as Independent Valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS and the International Valuation Standards IVS1.
The valuation of each investment property was on the basis of Market Value, subject to the assumption that the investment properties would be sold subject to any existing leases.
The Market Value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
DTZ has assumed that each Port will continue to be operational and has made the special assumption that all investment properties are free from contamination and that any spillages or contamination will be removed by the tenant prior to the termination of the lease.
In accordance with the Valuation Standards, DTZ confirms that it has not provided other property advice.
In relation to the firms preceding year the total fees paid by the Company as a percentage of the firms total fee income was less than 5%.
DTZ maintains a policy of rotating valuers in accordance with Practice Statement 5.2.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nordic Group is considered to have an indefinite life in accordance with IFRS 3 revised.
Customer relationships recognised on the acquisition of the Nordic Group are written off on a straight-line basis over a period of up to fifteen years.
Amortisation of customer relationships of 0.8m 2009 0.8m is included in the cost of sales line in the Income Statement.
Amortisation of software of 0.0m 2009 0.0m is charged to cost of sales and 0.4m 2009 0.6m to administrative expenses.
Goodwill of 14.1m and 1.5m has been allocated for impairment purposes to individual cash generating units CGUs, being two of the trading divisions of the Nordic Group Nordic Recycling Limited NRL and Nordic Data Management Limited NDM respectively.
The allocation was based on managements expectation of future economic benefits from those CGUs, and is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.
Forth Ports Annual Report and Accounts 2010 73 notes on the Accounts Continued 15.
IntAnGIBLe Assets Continued The recoverable amount has been determined on a value in use basis.
The calculations are based on five year pre-tax cash flow projections approved by management.
Cash flows beyond the initial five year period are extrapolated using the growth rate below.
The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are as follows: Assumption How Determined Revenue Estimated revenue has been based on management projections taking into account experience and minimum contracted revenue.
Operating margin Estimated operating margin has been based on management projections taking into account experience and changes in cost base following acquisition by the Group.
This includes operating costs and maintenance capital expenditure.
Growth rate The growth rates in the first five years for all the CGUs range from 2.25% to 27.5%.
The weighted average growth rate used after the fifth year is 2.25% which is consistent with the UKs long-term average growth in GDP.

Options were granted to employees at a fixed price of 10.75 equal to 10% below market price on a three day average on and around the date of grant.
The vesting period was five years.
If the options remained unexercised after a period of six months from the vesting date, the options expired.
Exercise of an option was subject to continued employment although employees ceasing employment due to retiral or redundancy were able to exercise their options pro rata before the full term had elapsed.
Employees who left after three years had elapsed could exercise their options pro rata up to their date of leaving.

32. retIrement BenefIt schemes The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called The Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme that covers the vast majority of employees.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
The Nordic Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The pension cost relating to The Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme was assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The latest formal actuarial assessment of the scheme was as at 5th April 2008.
The actuaries have provided updated figures for the scheme as at 31st December 2010.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions which are listed overleaf.
The total pension cost was 4.8m 2009 3.4m.
Member contributions are paid in addition.
A number of employees are members of The Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme FRDW scheme.
The Group also has a contractual relationship with self-employed pilots who operate within the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay to provide pilotage services.
The self-employed pilots make payments into the Pilots National Pension Fund PNPF.
The FRDW scheme is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme which was set up many years ago on a national basis to provide pensions to Registered Dock Workers.
The most recent formal valuation of the FRDW scheme was carried out in 2010 which recorded a small surplus.
On an ongoing basis, it was fully funded.
The total assets and liabilities of the FRDW scheme are not assigned to specific employers.
On the basis that the FRDW scheme is fully funded, the Group does not believe that it has any exposure to this pension scheme.
The employers are not entitled to participate in any surplus arising in the FRDW scheme.
The contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.0m 2009 0.0m.
The Company and Port of Dundee Limited PODL are the Competent Harbour Authorities in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay respectively where they are responsible for the provision of pilotage services.
The pilotage acts are provided by self-employed pilots.
The Trustee of the PNPF Scheme issued proceedings in the High Court in order to seek directions from the Court as to how, by whom and in what proportion the Schemes deficit should be made up.
The judgement was delivered in June 2010 and the judge decided that, in addition to Competent Harbour Authorities who employ pilots directly, Competent Harbour Authorities whose pilots are self-employed could be required by the Trustee to contribute to the Scheme deficit.
This decision has, however, been appealed by a number of Competent Harbour Authorities and until the outcome of that appeal is known, it is not possible to state with certainty what financial effect, if any, there may be on PODL and the Company.

Previously the interest cost was shown partly in Cost of Sales and partly in Administrative Expenses.
The analysis of the total pension cost for 2009 above has therefore been restated.
The effect has been to reduce Cost of Sales by 0.8m and Administrative Expenses by 0.2m.
The overall charge to the Income Statement is unchanged.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio and an allowance made for expected expenses.
This gave an assumed rate of 5.94% net of expenses at 31st December 2010.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31st December 2010 was 21.9m 2009 22.2m.

AcquIsItIon of remAInInG shAre cApItAL In oceAn termInAL WIth meAsurement perIod Adjustment On 17th December 2009, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the issued share capital of OTL that it did not already own, thereby obtaining control of OTL.
OTL is a property investment company which operates the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre in Leith.
In accordance with IFRS 3 revised, as early adopted by the Group for the year ended 31st December 2009, the acquirer has a period of time no longer than 12 months, referred to as the measurement period, to finalise the accounting for such a business combination.
In such circumstances, comparative prior period information included in subsequent financial statements should be revised to include the effect of the identified adjustment.
The total acquisition accounting adjustment gain taken to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31st December 2009 as a result of the acquisition was previously reported as 7.6m, comprising a fair value uplift in the previous joint venture holding of 4.6m, and a further 3.0m of negative goodwill arising on acquisition.
The negative goodwill arising on the acquisition arose as a result of there being an excess of net assets acquired over the consideration paid.
Following review of the existing tax structure, likely future performance and tax loss utilisation levels, it is considered appropriate to recognise net deferred tax assets of 8.5m in relation to historical tax losses within OTL that existed at date of acquisition and a further 2.2m in respect of the cash flow hedge creditor at the date of acquisition.
The revised negative goodwill arising on acquisition is shown below.
The negative goodwill is not taxable.

Group net assets as previously reported at 31st December 2009 were 228.5m.
The impact of the revision on net assets is an increase of 10.7m, resulting in net assets as revised at 31st December 2009 of 239.2m.
