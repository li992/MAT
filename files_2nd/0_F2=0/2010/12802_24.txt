com 1 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Punch Taverns plc and all of its subsidiaries.
The Groups interests in its joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment in value in the financial statements of the Company.
Investments in joint ventures are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of accumulated comprehensive income, less distributions received and less any impairment in value.
All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Where assets are transferred between segments or disposed, the goodwill attributable to these assets is also transferred or charged to the income statement respectively.
Goodwill carried in the balance sheet is not amortised.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Operating leases and other intangible assets The fair values attached to operating head leasehold interests on acquisitions are deemed to represent lease premiums, and are carried as intangible assets.
These operating leases together with other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Operating leases Over the term of the lease Software 3 to 10 years Payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leases are accounted for as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties held at 22 August 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were revalued at that date and this revaluation is the deemed cost under IFRS.
Landlords fixtures and fittings include removable items, which are generally regarded as within landlord ownership.
These are depreciated in accordance with the policy detailed below.
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual values, by equal annual instalments as follows: Licensed properties, unlicensed properties and owner-occupied properties 50 years or the life of the lease if shorter Landlords fixtures and fittings, office furniture and fittings and motor vehicles 5 to 15 years Information technology equipment 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An annual assessment of residual values is performed and there is no depreciable amount if residual values are the same as, or more than, book value.
Residual values are based on the estimated amount that would be currently obtainable from disposal of the asset net of disposal costs if the asset were already of the age and condition expected at the end of its useful life.
63 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 21 August 2010 continued 1 Accounting policies continued Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
A review for indicators of impairment is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
When an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic resources as a result of past events.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated taking account of any issue costs, and any discounts or premiums on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds, net of direct issue costs.
Convertible bonds On issue, the debt and equity components of convertible bonds are separated and recorded at fair value net of issue costs.
The fair value of the debt component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
This amount is classified as a liability and measured on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in equity, net of income tax effects.
The carrying amount of the equity component is not re-measured in subsequent years.
On early repurchase of the convertible bond, the consideration paid is allocated to the liability and equity components at the date of transaction.
The liability component at the date of transaction is determined using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt at the date of the transaction, with the equity component as the residual of the consideration paid and the liability component at the date of transaction.
The difference between the consideration paid for the repurchase allocated to the liability component and the carrying amount of the liability at that date is recognised in profit or loss.
The amount of consideration paid for the repurchase and transaction costs relating to the equity component is recognised in equity.
Taxation Income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable, based on taxable profits for the year, and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or where the deferred tax asset or liability arises on an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Movements in deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
For properties acquired as part of a business combination, movements in the deferred tax liability resulting from indexation allowance are taken to the income statement until the tax base cost plus indexation allowance reaches the fair value on acquisition, and directly to equity thereafter for historic revaluation surpluses.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Leasing Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
A corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leases are accounted for as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities.
Any defined benefit assets are limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount within finance income or finance expense.
The cumulative net deficits on these defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in full in equity at the date of transition to IFRS and subsequent actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group also contributes to money purchase pension plans for employees.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially accounted for and subsequently re-measured to fair value.
The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in forecast transactions.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement immediately.
The replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiry, sale or termination where such replacement or rollover is part of the documented hedging strategy.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
65 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 21 August 2010 continued 1 Accounting policies continued Share based payment transactions A number of employees of the Group including Directors receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based on a binomial model, a beta model or the Black-Scholes model dependent upon the most appropriate valuation model for the individual scheme.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Punch Taverns plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
All operations take place solely in the United Kingdom.
Drink and food sales Revenue in respect of drink and food sales is recognised at the point at which the goods are provided, net of any discounts or volume rebates allowed.
Rents receivable Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Machine income The Groups share of net machine income is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amount.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Receivables are written off against the doubtful debt provision when management deems the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost calculated on a first in first out basis and net realisable value.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification.
Dividend distribution Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups and the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Exceptional items In order to provide a trend measure of underlying performance, profit is presented excluding items which management consider will distort comparability, either due to their significant non-recurring nature or as a result of specific accounting treatments.
Further detail on the nature of exceptional items is included in note 6.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgements including those relating to income taxes, deferred tax, financial instruments, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, valuations, provisions and post-employment benefits.
Management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group assesses whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These assumptions are disclosed in note 13.
Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and estimated sale proceeds.
Actual outcomes may vary from these estimates.
Post-employment benefits The present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 28.
Any change in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of pension liabilities.
Onerous lease provisions The Group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expense is in excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts: however, any changes to the estimated method of exiting from the property could lead to changes to the level of the provision recorded.
Effectiveness of cash flow hedges The Group performs an assessment of the probability of future cash flows on the floating rate notes and related interest rate swaps.
Where future expected hedged cash flows are expected to still be highly probable, the Group continues to account for these as effective cash flow hedges, with the effective portion being recognised in equity.
Where future expected cash flows are deemed not to be highly probable but are still expected to occur, the Group discontinues hedge accounting from the date of the assessment.
From this date, all movements in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Where future expected cash flows are deemed to no longer be expected to occur, the Group discontinues hedge accounting from this date and recycles the existing accumulated amounts in equity in the income statement.
From this date all future movements in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Authorisation of financial statements The Groups and Companys financial statements of Punch Taverns plc the Company for the period ended 21 August 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 11 October 2010 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Ian Dyson and Phil Dutton.
Corporate information Punch Taverns plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England.
The Companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
67 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 21 August 2010 continued 2 Segmental analysis The Group has two reportable segments, a leased estate Punch Partnerships and a managed estate Punch Pub Company, which are the Groups strategic business units.
Each strategic business unit consists of a number of cash generating units CGUs, which are individual pubs.
These CGUs generate their own revenues, which are consolidated to give the Group revenue and as a result, Group revenue is not reliant on one significant customer.
The Groups risks and returns are affected predominantly by the differences in the products and services provided by the strategic business units.
Between 22 August 2009 and 21 August 2010, one pub with a fair value of 1.2m has transferred from the managed to the leased estate.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is represented by the Executive Directors and senior management of the Group.
Performance is measured based on segmental EBITDA, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors and senior management.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and therefore has only one geographical segment.

Included in the income statement are the following exceptional items: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 21 August 22 August 2010 2009 m m Operating Redundancy and other related one-off costs 1.5 8.5 1 Movement on property liabilities 32.7 28.9 Impairment losses note 13 217.6 663.1 2,3 Goodwill charge 9.0 52.1 3 Loss on sale of non-current assets 5.5 4.3 266.3 756.9 Finance income 4 Loan note redemptions 44.4 246.0 5 Movement in fair value of interest rate swaps 68.0 55.2 Total exceptional items before tax 289.9 566.1 Tax Tax impact of exceptional items 29.6 111.6 6 Recognition of previously uncrystallised deferred tax assets 119.8 7 Tax impact of indexation 6.2 8 Adjustments to tax in respect of prior periods 7.7 27.0 2 Recognition of deferred tax assets not previously recognised on acquisition 24.1 37.3 276.3 Total exceptional items after tax 252.6 289.8 1 Represents provision for rent payments following the reversion of onerous leases to the Group and additional provision for onerous leases.
2 Represents 9.0m write down of goodwill August 2009: 28.0m, of which 5.8m related to the leased estate August 2009: 17.9m and 3.2m related to the managed estate August 2009: 10.1m, relating to the apportioned value of goodwill allocated to those pubs disposed of during the year.
In the prior period, also represents tax losses of 24.1m which had previously not been recognised on the acquisition of the Spirit group in January 2006, which were subsequently recognised in the year.
3 In order to better reflect the nature of disposal transactions, loss on sale of non-current assets and goodwill charge have been reclassified within operating profit loss, for which comparatives have been restated.
4 Represents profit on the purchase of securitised debt and convertible bonds together with the write off of related deferred issue costs.
5 Represents the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Whilst the interest rate swaps are considered to be effective in matching the amortising profile of existing or planned floating rate borrowings, they do not meet the definition of an effective hedge due to the relative size of the mark to market difference of the swap at the date of acquisition or inception, or changes in expected future maturity profiles.
At 22 August 2009 interest rate swaps held to hedge the Punch Taverns Finance B Limited Class A8 notes were deemed to be ineffective due to the intention to purchase and cancel a portion of these notes ahead of their expected legal maturity.
As a result, a charge of 19.3m was recycled through the income statement.
6 In the prior period, represents the recognition of deferred tax assets that relate to capital losses arising on a group restructuring.
7 In the prior period, represents tax impact of RPI for the full year on the indexation allowance applied to the tax based cost of properties.
8 Represents the impact of finalising past tax matters.
In the prior period also represented changes to base cost information in relation to property assets.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders after adding back interest on dilutive convertible bonds by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the effects of dilutive options and dilutive convertible bonds.
The equity portion of the convertible bonds has been assessed and its impact is not dilutive on either basic earnings or adjusted earnings at 22 August 2009.

The Group leases various licensed properties, offices and other commercial properties and other assets under finance leases.
The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Included in property, plant and equipment above are motor vehicles held under finance leases with a net book value of 2.4m August 2009: 2.4m and properties held under finance leases with a net book value of 13.1m August 2009: 14.4m.
Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 4,460.6m August 2009: 4,943.4m over which the Groups borrowings are secured by way of fixed and floating charges.

2 Reclassification of amortisation between operating leases and tangible fixed assets.
Included within operating leases are properties with a net book value of 78.7m August 2009: 61.9m over which the Groups borrowings are secured by way of fixed and floating charges.
Other intangible assets relate to computer software.
At 21 August 2010, the goodwill assigned to the leased estate is 348.2m August 2009: 353.9m and the goodwill assigned to the managed estate is 146.9m August 2009: 150.2m.
While there was no goodwill impairment, goodwill has been reduced in the year by 9.0m 2009: 28.0m, 5.8m August 2009: 17.9m of which related to the leased estate and 3.2m August 2009: 10.1m related to the managed estate, representing the apportioned value of goodwill allocated to those pubs disposed of during the year.
com 13 Impairment losses Property, plant and equipment and operating leases When any indicators of impairment are identified, property, plant and equipment and operating leases are reviewed for impairment based on each cash generating unit CGU.
The cash generating units are individual pubs.
The carrying value of these individual pubs was compared to the recoverable amount of the CGUs, which was based predominantly on value-in-use.
Where it is considered more likely than not that a pub will be disposed within the near-term rather than continue to be held and traded by the Group, the recoverable amount is based on the estimated fair value less costs to sell of that pub rather than by reference to its value-in-use, which is lower.
Due to further weakening in trading in our non core pubs, further impairments have been recognised in both the leased and managed estates as follows: 52 weeks to 21 August 2010 52 weeks to 22 August 2009 Leased Managed Total Leased Managed Total m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 209.1 8.5 217.6 478.5 137.0 615.5 Operating leases 4.9 42.7 47.6 209.1 8.5 217.6 483.4 179.7 663.1 Following a review of the entire estate, 1,347 pubs have been identified as non core, being considered not sustainable as pubs in the long term or to have a higher alternative use value.
These pubs are likely to be sold or converted for alternative use within the next five years and have been written down to their fair value less costs to sell, which is higher than their value-in-use.
Cash flows used in the value-in-use calculation are based on EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure.
Value-in-use is calculated using five year financial forecasts.
Beyond the initial five year period, cash flows are extrapolated for the remaining useful life of the CGUs using the growth rate assumed in the final year of the five year financial forecasts.
This rate assumes an ongoing trading decline for these pubs and therefore does not exceed either the UKs post-war average growth rate or the average long term growth rate for the market.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.0% August 2009: 8.5%.
Included within the above are reversals of impairment losses of property, plant and equipment of 25.2m for the leased estate and 0.8m for the managed estate.
The impairment reversals were primarily due to the identification of pubs where expected future cash flows have risen to a level such that their value-in-use is now above carrying value.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The Group has recognised a total impairment of 217.6m.
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at projected disposal values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
Key drivers to future growth rates are dependent on the Groups ability to maintain drinks, rental and gaming machine profit streams in the leased business, whilst in the managed business, future growth rates are dependent on the ability to maintain drinks, food and gaming machine profit streams whilst effectively managing pub operating costs.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the disposal values, growth rates used in the five year financial forecasts and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Impairment charge credit and reduction increase in net assets Leased Managed Total m m m Impact if disposal value was: increased by 10% 24.8 1.5 26.3 decreased by 10% 25.4 1.9 27.3 Impact if discount rate was: increased by 1% 1.2 1.2 decreased by 1% 1.5 1.5 Impact if business plan growth rates were: increased by 2% in each year 2.2 2.2 decreased by 2% in each year 1.5 1.5 Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units CGUs based on the benefits to the Group that arise from each business combination.
The two groups of CGUs are identified by their pub operating format leased or managed and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.
The value of the goodwill was reviewed for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of the CGUs to the carrying value of their goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs was determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These value-in-use calculations use the same assumptions as for property, plant and equipment and operating leases.
Neither a 2% decrease in the growth rate in each of the next five years nor a 1% increase in the discount rate would have led to an impairment of goodwill in the current period.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 300.3m August 2009: 131.7m and unused capital losses of 2,561.3m August 2009: 2,536.2m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 97.4m August 2009: 112.5m of such losses, which are expected to be utilised against future profit streams within the Group.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 2,764.2m August 2009: 2,555.4m of losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Current legislation deems that these losses may be carried forward for an unlimited number of years.
The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011.
The first reduction in the rate from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010 and will be effective from 1 April 2011.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
As the rate change was substantively enacted prior to the year end, the reduced rate has been included in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Had further tax rate changes been substantively enacted on or before the balance sheet date it would have had the effect of reducing the deferred tax liability recognised at that date by 0.4m per percentage point reduction.
