Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 29.
Share Based Payments continued b Equity-settled share option plans The group has two unapproved option plans providing employees and executives with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the company as an incentive to attract and retain the services of employees.
The two plans are the UK Discretionary Option Scheme 1996 and the 2008 US Share Option Plan.
Under the terms of these plans, options are granted with exercise prices not less than the fair market value of the companys shares.
They become exercisable over vesting periods, with initial vesting generally after 6 or 12 months and the remainder vesting over a period of 2.5 to 3.5 years.
Grants generally expire seven years from the date of grant.
Vested options are exercisable following termination of employment for periods ranging from zero to 90 days.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2010 had a weighted average exercise price of 8.17 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.1 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
