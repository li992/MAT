Such events and circumstances include the effects of restructuring initiated by management.
To determine whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cashgenerating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets at the Balance Sheet date was 1,181.6 million 31 December 2009: 1,184.3 million.
At 31 December 2010, the Group recognised no impairment loss in respect of these assets.

The Central corporate cost centre contains the Melrose Group head office costs whilst the Central LTIPs cost centre contains the costs associated with the 2009 Melrose Incentive Share Scheme and the divisional management LTIP schemes that are in operation across the Group.
Transfer prices between business units are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The Groups geographical segments are determined by the location of the Groups non-current assets and, for revenue, the location of external customers.
Inter-segment sales are not material and have not been included in the segment information.

Goodwill has been allocated to the business segments, each of which comprises several cash-generating units, as follows: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 m m Energy 252.1 245.1 Lifting 299.7 292.6 Dynacast 207.6 203.5 Other Industrial 38.7 38.0 798.1 779.2 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each cash-generating unit.
The growth rates are based on a prudent estimate of long term industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows based on estimated growth rates of between 2% and 3% 2009: 2% and 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The pre-tax discount rate applied is between 8% and 10% 2009: 7% and 9% depending on the risk elements associated with each cash-generating unit.
No impairment was identified and a reasonable possible change in the assumptions applied would not result in any impairment.

The Group utilises a 750 million multi-currency committed bank facility that provides term loan and revolving credit facilities through to 22 April 2013.
A number of Group companies act as guarantors to this facility.
Drawdowns bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the Groups performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 1.25% and 2.35%.
The margin as at 31 December 2010 was 1.5%.
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under these facilities.
The term loan facility is fully drawn down having originally been set at 500 million.
In 2009 the Group repaid and cancelled US $80 million of this term loan facility following the disposal of the Logistex businesses.
At 31 December 2010, the undrawn amount of the 250 million revolving credit facility was 234.6 million 31 December 2009: 224.9 million with 15.4 million 31 December 2009: 25.1 million being utilised for letters of credit.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis, after taking into account hedging interest rate derivatives, is described in note 24.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Groups non derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value is shown in the table below.
Interest on floating rate debt is based on the relevant LIBOR curve for US Dollar and Sterling balances and EURIBOR curve for Euro balances.
Interest on hedging interest rate swaps is based on the relevant forward LIBOR curve for US Dollar amounts and EURIBOR curve for Euro and is illustrated as a net cash flow.

These losses may be carried forward indefinitely subject to certain continuity of business requirements.
An asset of 33.0 million 31 December 2009: 18.3 million has been recognised in respect of other timing differences.
A significant part of the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group accounts relates to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan, the FKI UK Pension Plan and the FKI US Pension Plan.
A deferred tax asset of 12.9 million 31 December 2009: 7.4 million has been recognised on these obligations to the extent that they are expected to generate tax deductions against foreseeable profits.
As at 31 December 2010, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 4.5 million 31 December 2009: 4.0 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Share-based payments Melrose 2009 Incentive Share Scheme The Company has 50,000 2009 Incentive Shares held by Directors, employees and the Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trust.
Further details of the scheme are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 40 and 41.
The estimated fair value attributable to the 2009 Incentive Shares formerly the 2007 Incentive Shares using a Black Scholes option pricing model at 31 December 2010 was 70.7 million 31 December 2009: 21.0 million.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model used to fair value the Scheme when it was originally established in 2007 were as follows: Valuation assumptions Weighted average share price 1.67 Weighted average exercise price 1.00 Expected volatility 25.0% Expected life as at inception 4.8yrs Risk free interest 2.0% Expected dividend yield 3.2% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price.
The Group recognised an IFRS 2 accrual of 1.8 million 2009: 1.8 million in relation to the Melrose 2009 Incentive Share Scheme in 2010.

Retirement benefit obligations Melrose holds several pension plans covering many of its employees and operating in several jurisdictions.
The most significant defined benefit plans are: The FKI UK Pension Plan.
This is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan where the future liabilities for members benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan.
This is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan other than 3.3 million of unfunded liabilities where the future liabilities for members benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Other plans include the Cleco Logistex UK Plan, the Dynacast US defined benefit plan and a number of funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements across Europe.
Further details of the status of the significant plans are disclosed in the Directors report on page 32.
The cost of these plans is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
In line with normal practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
The valuations are based on the UK full actuarial valuations as of 31 December 2008 updated at 31 December 2010 by independent actuaries and US full actuarial valuations as of 1 January 2010 updated at 31 December 2010 by independent actuaries.
The Group also operates unfunded retiree medical and welfare benefit plans, principally in the US.
During the year, it was announced to members that the FKI UK Pension Plan would be closed to the accrual of future benefit as of 28 February 2011 resulting in a curtailment gain of 13.1 million.
The Group also entered into a buyout arrangement to dispose of the liabilities of the Bridon Group Senior Executive Plan, formerly part of the FKI UK Pension Plans, for 4.0 million in excess of the carrying value of the plan net liabilities.
The Company contributes 18.5 million per annum to the FKI UK Pension Plan and 4.6 million per annum to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan.
In addition to this, there are a number of defined contribution plans across the Group.
Contributions during the year were 14.4 million 2009: 15.1 million.
Actuarial assumptions The major weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries in calculating the Groups pension plan assets and liabilities are as set out below: 31 December 2010 FKI US US Retiree FKI UK McKechnie Pension Benefit Other Plan UK Plan Plan Plans plans % p. a.
Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 3.95 3.50 n a 3.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.30 3.45 n a n a 3.22 Discount rate 5.55 5.55 5.10 5.10 5.44 RPI inflation assumption 3.45 3.45 2.75 n a 3.41 31 December 2009 FKI US US Retiree FKI UK McKechnie Pension Benefit Other Plan UK Plan Plan Plans plans % p. a.

This results in an inflation rate 0.85% lower than RPI for those members.
The resulting reduction in the present value of plan liabilities of 12.3 million is included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Mortality FKI UK Pension Plan Mortality assumptions for the most significant plan in the Group, the FKI UK Pension Plan, as at 31 December 2010 are based on 90% of the heavy Self Administered Pension Scheme SAPS tables, reflecting the plan membership being largely employed in the industrial sector.
Future improvements are in line with 80% 60% for women of the Long Cohort, subject to a minimum underpin of 1% p. a.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.2 years if they are male and for a further 23.6 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2035 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live for a further 22.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.9 years after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions are in line with those adopted for the triennial valuation results as at 31 December 2008.
Sensitivities Sensitivities around movements in the principal assumptions of the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality are discussed in the Finance Directors review on page 23.

The Groups credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Note 16 provides further details regarding the recovery of trade receivables.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy for managing liquidity risk is set out in the Finance Directors review on page 24.

In January 2009, the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge $546.0 million of US Dollar denominated bank debt into fixed rates of interest.
Under the terms of these swaps the Group will pay an average rate of 2.1% p. a. plus a 2.0% margin annually in arrears and receive 3 month US Dollar LIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears.
These swaps all mature in January 2013.
In April 2009, the Group also took out an interest rate swap to hedge 33.3 million of Euro denominated debt into fixed rates of interest.
The swap is structured in a similar way to the US Dollar interest rate swaps with the Group paying 2.6% plus a 2.0% margin annually in arrears and receiving 3 month EURIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears.
This swap matures in April 2013.
A corresponding amount of debt drawn under the 500 million term loan is matched with these swaps.
These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective throughout 2010.
The fair value of the contracts at 31 December 2010 was a net liability of 10.0 million 31 December 2009: net asset of 0.8 million.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7 as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial asset or liability will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the transactional impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the increase in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling compared to the year end spot rate.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.
The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a material impact are noted here: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 m m US Dollar 1.8 1.6 Euro 2.7 1.2 Czech Koruna 0.7 0.4 The following table details the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the decrease increase in Group equity caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling.

However, there would be no effect on equity because there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation.
Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet Foreign currency forward contract fair values are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Commodity swap fair values are measured using quoted forward commodity prices.
Interest rate swap contract fair values are measured using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair value is shown below.

Post Balance Sheet events Since 31 December 2010 the Group has disposed of three of the smaller businesses, namely Brush Traction, Logistex UK and Madico generating aggregated sales proceeds of 20.7 million.
Contingent liabilities Two Bridon companies that the Group acquired as part of the acquisition of FKI plc are defendants with their American distributor in an action in the US federal court in Houston, Texas, commenced by Noble Drilling Services, Inc. a purchaser of wire anchor lines that were manufactured by Bridon prior to its acquisition by the Group, sold by its distributor and used by Noble to moor certain of its mobile, semisubmersible offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
Noble has claimed approximately US $94 million in damages plus loss of goodwill, alleging that certain ropes were defective and broke during Hurricane Ike in 2008.
No adequate breakdown of Nobles claim has been provided to date.
In a separate case pending in the same court, the lessee of the same offshore drilling rigs, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has sued Noble for approximately US $24 million in damages plus removal of debris, claiming that the rigs were unseaworthy in breach of the terms of its agreement with Noble to operate the rigs.
Noble in turn has asserted identical claims to those asserted in the first action, alleging that if Noble is found liable to Anadarko, Bridon and its distributor should be liable for any damages that Noble suffers.
The two cases were recently consolidated and remain in the earliest procedural stages as the discovery process has just commenced.
Accordingly, it is too early in the case to assess the merits of Nobles claims.
Bridon has insurance coverage of up to US $160 million at current exchange rates that may be available to respond and Bridons insurers have been indemnifying its defence costs to date.
Bridon intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted against it.
Since 2008, Bridon has provided US $7.5 million in respect of this claim.
In addition, as a result of the acquisition of the Dynacast, McKechnie and FKI businesses, certain further contingent legal, environmental and tax liabilities were identified.
Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these claims, the Directors best estimate of the outcome of these claims has been included in the Balance Sheet.
The Group has contingent liabilities representing guarantees and contract bonds given in the ordinary course of business on behalf of trading subsidiaries.
No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities.
