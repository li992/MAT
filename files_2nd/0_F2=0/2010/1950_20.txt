Notes to the Accounts 1 Revenue Segmental analysis For the purposes of determining its reportable segments, the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Board has reviewed the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, including consideration of the internal reporting itreceives to assess performance and to make decisions on how resources are allocated.
The Board regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position for its entire operations, which are based in the UK, and receives financial information for the UK as a whole.
As a consequence, having carefully considered the requirements of IFRS 8, the Board hasconcluded that the Group has one reportable segment, which is UK housebuilding.
As there is only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are measured and reported tothe CODM, on a basis consistent with the Group financial statements, no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Group Finance Directors Review on pages 18 to 21.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations as a whole, which are based in the UK, when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation of resources.

5 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
A full review of inventories was performed at 31 July 2010, and the carrying value of land was compared to the net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion and overheads.
Estimated selling prices were reviewed on a site by site basis and selling prices were amended based on local management and the Boards assessment of current market conditions.
No further exceptional land write downs or land write backs were required as a result of this review.
The exceptional charge of 66.312 million for the year ended 31 July 2009 comprised write downs to net realisable value arising from site reviews 58.881 million, option costs and related fees 6.338 million, and part-exchange properties 1.093 million.

The effective income tax charge is 19.4% of profit before tax 2009 24.9% tax credit of loss before tax and compares favourably to theGroups standard tax rate for the year of 28.0% 2009 28.0%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to enhanced claims for qualifying expenditure on remediated land, relating to current and prior periods, which have reduced the overall tax charge by 5.3 million in the year.
The UK corporation tax rate changed from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
The hybrid tax rate continued to affect the tax credit for the year ended 31 July 2009 with respect to losses carried back from that period.
The adjustment in respect of the prior years current and deferred tax has been applied to the pre-exceptional charge in the income statement for the year ended 31 July 2009.

8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership plans which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Earnings Weighted average Earnings Earnings loss Weighted average Earnings loss 2010 number of per share 2009 number of per share ordinary shares 2010 ordinary shares 2009 2010 2009 1 Pre-exceptional item 000 no.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information 10 Investment property continued Investment properties, which represent properties where Bellway has retained an interest in a sold property, are valued under the cost model and are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
A formal internal valuation of investment properties was carried out at the end of the financial year.
The fair value of investment properties was assessed at 8.238 million 2009 7.983 million.
As noted above, the Group assessed the residual values as being highly likely to exceed cost and, in the event that costs exceed residual values, any excess would be viewed as not likely to be material in the Groups financial statements.
The Group has determined, therefore, that no depreciation should be charged 2009 nil.
The investment properties are a proportion of the cost of residential units constructed by the Group, the units being sold under a shared ownership scheme.

Other financial assets comprise loans, largely with non fixed repayment dates and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited over the estimated deferred term to cost of sales finance income in the previous period see accounting policies, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk, which the directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining present values.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 July 2010 2009 nil.
None of the other financial assets are past their due dates 2009 nil.
At initial recognition, the fair value of the assets is calculated using a discount rate, appropriate to the class of assets, which reflects market conditions at the date of entering into the transaction.
The directors consider at the end of each reporting period whether the initial market discount rate still reflects up to date market conditions.
If a revision is required, the fair value of the asset is re-measured at the present value of the revised future cash flows using this revised discount rate: the difference between this value and the carrying value of the asset is recorded against the carrying value of the asset and recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The directors considered that there was no material difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets at 31 July 2010 or31 July 2009 and accordingly have not recognised any movements directly within the Statement of Comprehensive Income to date.
The Company has no other financial assets.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information 18 Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Groups policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Groups cash balances, manage the Groups working capital requirements and finance the Groups ongoing operations.
The Companys only financial instruments are cash and Preference Shares.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group finances its operations through retained earnings, bank borrowings and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the Trust also purchase shares for the future satisfaction of employee share options.
On 6 August 2009 the Group announced the successful placing of 5,747,648 new ordinary shares of 12.5p each representing approximately 5.0% of the Groups issued ordinary share capital prior to the Placing note 19.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Groups financial instruments have been identified as credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, are set out below.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position see note 15.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance bythese counterparties.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held see note 17.
No other security is held against any other financial assets of the Group.
The Board considers the Groups exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which itoperates.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing facilities and cash flows against forecast requirements based on a two year rolling cash forecast.
The Groups banking arrangements outlined below are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium-term cash flow needs therefore mitigating the Groups liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations to interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Groups overdraft and floating rate bank loans bear interest based on either LIBOR or the Bank of England base rate.
For the year ended 31 July 2010 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would increase the Groups profit before tax by 0.4 million 2009 decrease the Groups profit before tax by 1.8 million.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by movements in UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate housing market risk on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long-term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
Bellway p. l. c. 61 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial risk management continued Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value being the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date isasfollows: Balance at Total contracted Within one year 12 25 More than 31 July cash payment or on demand years years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2010 61,853 65,818 45,790 7,874 7,064 5,090 At 31 July 2009 109,967 113,474 85,341 21,230 6,752 151 The maturity profile of the total contracted payments in respect of financial liabilities excluding amounts due on land creditors shown separately above is as follows: Balance at Total contracted Within one year 12 25 More than 31 July cash payment or on demand years years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans floating rates 80,000 83,480 1,030 15,990 66,460 Preference shares 20,000 27,600 1,900 1,900 23,800 Trade and other payables 91,883 91,883 89,049 2,834 At 31 July 2010 191,883 202,963 91,979 17,890 90,260 2,834 Bank loans floating rates 80,000 84,521 1,030 1,030 62,262 20,199 Preference shares 20,000 29,500 1,900 1,900 25,700 Trade and other payables 69,776 69,776 69,776 At 31 July 2009 169,776 183,797 72,706 2,930 87,962 20,199 The interest rates on the preference shares apply to the whole term of the relevant instruments.
The imputed interest rate on land payables reflects market interest rates available to the Group on floating rate bank loans at the time ofacquiring the land.
At the year end, the Group had 225.0 million 2009 290.0 million of undrawn bank facilities available.
The Companys only financial liabilities are preference shares as disclosed in the maturity profile above.
Cash and cash equivalents This comprises cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity date of less than one month.
The amounts of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended 31 July 2010 and 31 July 2009 for both the Group and the Company are shown in note 22.
At 31 July 2010 the average interest rate earned on the temporary closing cash balance was 1.32% 2009 0.22%.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

IFRS 2 has been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002, which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Awards under the LTIP have been made to executive directors and the company secretary, with awards under the annual bonus scheme also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at alllevels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, thecurrent intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under the scheme.
Awards will be available tovest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the above Schemes is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section onpages 34 and 38 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
For awards made prior to 16 January 2008, vesting of awards under the LTIP is dependent upon total shareholder return of the Group measured against relevant comparator companies as detailed on page 38 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
For awards made on 16 January 2008, vesting of awards is dependent upon two conditions, total shareholder return and return on capital employed.
For awards made on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009, vesting of awards is dependent only on total shareholder return as detailed on page 38 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
With regard to the annual bonus scheme, for awards up to and including those for the year ended 31 July 2006, one half was payable in November each year following the announcement of the Groups annual results.
The other half was used to acquire Bellway shares at the prevailing market value.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
In addition, various small share awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level.
These awards mainly had three year vesting periods.
Awards to executive directors and to the company secretary in relation to the year ended 31 July 2007, and subsequent years, are made in cash with no compulsory deferral element.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.
The number and weighted average exercise price of share-based payments is as follows: LTIP and annual bonus 2010 2009 Number of Number of options options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 571,747 531,131 Granted during the year 197,335 240,799 Exercised during the year 148,495 200,183 Outstanding at the end of the year 620,587 571,747 Exercisable at the end of the year 3,000 1,000 The options outstanding at 31 July 2010 have a weighted average contractual life of 1.3 years 2009 1.5 years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 765.5p 2009 515.4p.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 681.3p 2009 677.4p.
Valuation methodology For the LTIP, a Monte Carlo simulation method is used which allows the Groups performance, in terms of total shareholder return, to bemeasured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities are calculated for each of the comparator companies.
Acorrelation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, is also used.
In the case of the deferred element of the annual bonus, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result isthat the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
The inputs into the models for the various grants in the current and previous year were as follows: November November October November November November 2009 2009 2009 2008 2008 2008 Scheme description 3 year SRSOS 5 year SRSOS LTIP 3 year SRSOS 5 year SRSOS LTIP Grant date 11 Nov 2009 11 Nov 2009 29 Oct 2009 13 Nov 2008 13 Nov 2008 4 Nov 2008 Risk free interest rate 2.1% 2.9% 0% 2.90% 3.50% 0% Exercise price 661.6p 661.6p 336.0p 336.0p Share price at date of grant 750.5p 750.5p 715p 515p 515p 576p Expected dividend yield 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 4.50% 4.50% 4.00% Expected life 3 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 5 years 3 years 2 months 2 months 2 months 2 months Vesting date 1 Feb 2013 1 Feb 2015 29 Oct 2012 1 Feb 2012 1 Feb 2014 4 Nov 2011 Expected volatility 55% 45% 55% 50% 40% 50% Fair value of option 284p 279p 360p 212p 195p 395.0p The expected volatility for all models was determined by considering the volatility levels historically for the Group.
Volatility levels for more recent years were considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1.372 million 2009 1.318 million in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
