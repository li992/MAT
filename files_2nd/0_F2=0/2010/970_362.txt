148 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 FinAnciAl stAtements: Notes to the financial statements continued 25. financial Risk management and deRivative financial assets liabilities continued Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, together with insurance cover including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event, which based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is disclosed in note 21.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects are financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities including associated derivatives, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date are as follows: Within one year One to two years Fixed Floating Capital Fixed Floating Capital US$ million interest interest repayment interest interest repayment 2010 1 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 566 148 6,356 566 126 1,155 2 Net settled derivatives 485 303 13 486 306 3 81 451 6,343 80 432 1,152 2009 1 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 550 200 5,660 523 185 3,226 2 Net settled derivatives 461 267 441 273 5 89 467 5,660 82 458 3,221 Two to five years Greater than five years Fixed Floating Capital Fixed Floating Capital US$ million interest interest repayment interest interest repayment 2010 3 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,197 137 7,504 530 1,400 3,241 2 Net settled derivatives 1,083 619 337 530 282 291 114 756 7,841 1,682 3,532 2009 3 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,379 295 5,877 672 608 4,394 2 Net settled derivatives 1,187 712 32 672 331 339 192 1,007 5,909 939 4,733 1 Includes guarantees and loan facilities.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures as hedging is not deemed appropriate given the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar expenditure on approved capital projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
