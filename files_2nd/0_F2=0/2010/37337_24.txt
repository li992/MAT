The restated dividend per share represents the theoretical dividend per share that would have been paid had the bonus shares inherent in the 2009 rights issue been in existence at the relevant dividend dates.
During the year, the Company introduced a scrip dividend scheme, which provides shareholders with the option to receive their dividend in shares as opposed to cash.
As a result of shares issued in lieu of dividends of 17.6m 2009: nil, dividends paid in cash, as set out in the consolidated statement of cash flows, totalled 217.9m 2009: 302.4m.
The Board has proposed a final quarterly dividend for the year ended 31 March 2010 of 7.0p per share 2009: 7.0p, which will be a 100% PID and result in a further distribution of 53.3m 2009: 52.9m.
It will be paid on 30 July 2010 to shareholders who are on the Register of Members on 25 June 2010.
The final dividend is in addition to the third quarterly dividend of 7.0p or 53.1m paid on 1 April 2010 2009 restated: 14.9p or 76.8m.
The total dividend paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010 is 28.0p 2009 restated: 51.7p.
All of the dividends paid and payable in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2010 comprise PIDs to the extent that these dividends are paid in cash.
Scrip dividends are not treated as qualifying towards the Group PID requirement.

Income tax continued Land Securities Group PLC elected for group Real Estate Investment Trust REIT status with effect from 1 January 2007.
As a result the Group no longer pays UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.
During the year the Group reached agreement in relation to a number of issues, resulting in payment of additional tax of 14.0m and a release of provisions to the income statement of 21.0m.
If the remaining issues are resolved in the Groups favour, provisions established in previous periods of up to 86.7m 2009: 211.0m could be released in the future.

Accordingly, it excludes the effect of all exceptional items, debt and other restructuring charges, and other items of a capital nature other than trading properties and long-term contract profits as indicated above.
An EPRA measure has been included to assist comparison between European property companies.
We believe our measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.

The impairment in relation to the development land and infrastructure programmes within trading properties has been removed from both our and the EPRAs adjusted earnings due to the long-term nature of these programmes.
The adjustment to net liabilities on joint ventures is the result of valuation deficits in the prior year, partially reversed by surpluses in the current year.

Interest-rate swaps The Group uses interest-rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest-rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
The change in fair value of the contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments is taken to the income statement.
For contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges the change in the fair value of the contracts is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recognised from the designated cash flow hedges.
The deferred asset or liability assumed is released to the income statement during the term of each relevant swap.

Debt investors benefit from security over a pool of investment properties valued at 7.8bn at 31 March 2010 2009: 7.5bn.
The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial flexibility when the loan to value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively.
If these limits are exceeded the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage the reduction in gearing see note 27.
The interest rate is fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date for each MTN, whereupon the interest rate for the last two years is LIBOR plus a step-up margin.
The effective interest rate includes the amortisation of issue costs.
The MTN are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.
The 4.625 per cent MTN due 2013 has been classed as a short-term borrowing as it is anticipated that the monies will be repaid within 12 months.
Syndicated bank debt At 31 March 2010 the Group had a 1.5bn authorised credit facility with a maturity of August 2013, which was fully undrawn.
This facility is committed and is secured on the assets of the Security Group.
Bilateral facilities Committed Bilateral facilities totalling 650.0m are available to the Group and are secured on the assets of the Security Group.
These facilities mature between April and November 2014.
Queen Annes Gate QAG Bond On 29 July 2009, the Group issued a 360.3m bond secured on the rental cash flows from the commercial lease with the UK Government over Queen Annes Gate, London, SW1.
The QAG Bond is a fully amortising bond with a final maturity in February 2027 and a fixed interest rate of 5.253%.
Fair values The fair values of any floating rate financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value.

The new MTN did not meet the IAS 39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTN.
The amortisation is charged to net interest expenses in the income statement.

Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Corporate Governance section p6970 and Our risks and how we manage them p3637.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specific financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks principally interest-rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance, which includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 26 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders.
Whilst the Group is maintaining a strong focus on the business actions which are within its influence, a number of factors affecting the market in which the Group operates are beyond the Groups control.
After a period of rapid valuation decline, values began to stabilise in mid-2009, and have since experienced a strong rebound.
As a result of this and other actions taken, the Board believes the Group now has an appropriate gearing level for this phase of the property cycle.
The Groups strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio gearing and loan-to-value ratio LTV to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The following table details the Groups key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.

Financial risk management continued Financial risk factors i Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, amounts due from joint ventures, loans to third parties and commercial property backed loan notes.
Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specifically relates to each type of asset.
Bank and financial institutions One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, only independently-rated banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Group Treasury currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all its financial institution counterparties.
Furthermore, Group Treasury ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Groups policy limits.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and owing to the long-term nature and diversity of its tenancy arrangements, the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty.
This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required from the tenant at inception.
In general these deposits represent between three and six months rent.
Property sales Property sales receivables primarily relate to the sale of two properties, for which all payments to date have been received when due.
The credit risk on outstanding amounts is considered low.
Finance lease receivables This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
Loans to third parties A loan maturing in 2035 was made to Semperian PPP formerly Trillium Investment Partners LP as part of the disposal of the Trillium business.
This loan is not considered a significant credit risk as it is repayable from dividends from investments in Government infrastructure projects.
Commercial property backed loan notes The Group has acquired investments in commercial property backed loan notes which have been independently rated with a rating of AAA.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of Notes with final maturities between 2013 and 2036, and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.
Undrawn committed credit lines represent total undrawn committed facilities adjusted for amounts that would be restricted as a result of LTV covenants.
The Groups core financing structure is in the Security Group, although the remaining Non-Restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
Security Group The Groups principal financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets the Security Group that comprises the majority of the Groups investment property portfolio.
These arrangements operate in tiers determined by LTV and Interest cover ratio ICR.
This structure is most flexible at lower tiers with a lower LTV and a higher ICR and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom.
In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive.
No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0 x.
As at 31 March 2010, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 45.5%, meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and benefited from maximum operational flexibility.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.

Financial risk management continued Non-Restricted Group The Non-Restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt.
Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-Restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.

Interest rates The Group uses interest-rate swaps and similar instruments to manage its interest-rate exposure.
With property and interest-rate cycles typically of four to seven years duration, the Groups target is to have a minimum of 80% of anticipated debt at fixed rates of interest over this timeframe.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Where specific hedges are used in geared joint ventures to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt these qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2010, the Group including joint ventures had 1.1bn 2009: 2.7bn of hedges in place, and its net debt was 98.2% fixed 2009: 107%.
At the year-end all Group debt was fixed and subsequently the interest payable in the income statement is not sensitive to movements in interest rates.
In the prior year, based on year-end balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the net interest payable in the income statement by 3.5m.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange Foreign-exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
The Group does not normally enter into any foreign-currency transactions as it is UK based.
However, where committed expenditure in foreign currencies is identified, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of that exposure by entering into forward purchases of foreign currency to fix the Sterling value.
Therefore the Groups foreign-exchange risk is low.
The Group had no foreign-currency exposure at 31 March 2010 or at 31 March 2009.

Net pension deficit surplus Contributory money purchase scheme A contributory money purchase scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2010 2009 Group m m Defined contribution schemes 2.2 2.3 Defined benefit schemes Land Securities Scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is a wholly-funded scheme, and the assets of the Scheme are held in a selfadministered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected-unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected-unit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2009 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson Consultants & Actuaries.
As a result of this valuation, the Trustees and the Group have agreed that, in order to address the deficit at that time, the employer contributions of 30% of pensionable salary will be paid together with additional employer contributions of 4m per annum for a period of six years commencing on 1 July 2010.
This valuation was updated to 31 March 2010.
All death-in-service and benefits for incapacity arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post-retirement benefits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.
The major assumptions used in the valuation, were in nominal terms : 2010 2009 Group % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.80 3.40 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.80 3.40 Discount rate 5.60 7.00 Inflation 3.80 3.40 Expected return on plan assets 6.10 6.14 The expected return on plan assets is based on expectations for bonds and equities.
At the year end, the expected return on bonds is based on market yields of long-dated bonds at that date.
The estimated expected return on equities includes an additional equity-risk premium.

As a result, the accrued entitlement of the active members at 31 March 2006 has been linked to inflation, with future benefits accrued according to annual earnings.
The effect of this change was a reduction of 8.3m in the Groups pension liability associated with funding future anticipated salary increases.

Awards of LTIP Performance Shares and Matching Shares are subject to the same performance measures over three years.
For grants up to and including those made on 31 March 2009 half of any award will vest based on achieving increases in Normalised Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share NADEPS.
The other half will vest dependent on the Groups Total Property Return TPR equalling, or exceeding, IPD weighted indices which reflect the sector mix of Land Securities investment portfolio.
For awards commencing with the grant of LTIP Performance Shares on 29 June 2009, NADEPS has been replaced by a relative Total Shareholder Return TSR measure.
Specifically, Land Securities three-year TSR performance share price increase plus reinvested dividends will be compared against the TSR performance of an index of a comparator group of FTSE 350 Real Estate Companies.
Vesting is on a sliding scale between 0% for performance below the index and 100% for performance which beats the index by 4% per annum or more.
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares and or transfer of treasury shares and or transfer of shares other than treasury shares.
