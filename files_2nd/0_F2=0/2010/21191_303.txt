The cash flows projected are the expected future cash flows including expected investment cash flows from equities, bonds and properties earning a risk premium in excess of risk free, statutory reserves and required capital.
The risk premiums used are consistent with those used in the expected existing business contribution within operating earnings.
As the risk premiums are positive, a discount rate higher than risk-free is required to give a value equal to the market-consistent embedded value.
Average derived risk discount rates are shown below for the embedded value.

2 The US full-year 2009 IDR has been revised to reflect the expected future tax paying position of the business.
This reduces the IDR from 41.2% to 35.6%.
