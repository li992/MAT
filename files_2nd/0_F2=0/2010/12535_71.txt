Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 91 19.
Share capital continued Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 40.0% to 41.0% Risk free rate of interest: 3.3% to 3.7% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29 to 0.30 For the year ended 31 December 2010, the total cost recognised by the group for long-term incentive arrangements is US$38.9 million 2009: US$46.1 million, with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$nil 2009: US$28.4 million.
A credit of US$52.7 million has been recorded in retained earnings 2009: US$27.3 million for all equity-settled payments of the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
