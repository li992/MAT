266 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 46 Tax assets and liabilities This note analyses the tax assets and liabilities that appear in the statement of financial position, and explains the movements in these balances in the year.
a Current tax Current tax assets recoverable and liabilities payable in more than one year are 76 million and 246 million 2009: 254 million and 49 million.
The taxation of foreign profits and worldwide debt cap rules were enacted in the Finance Act 2009.
Under the foreign profits rules, a dividend exemption was introduced which largely exempts dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK corporation tax.
The Group has applied this legislation in arriving at its UK tax results for 2009 and 2010.
The worldwide debt cap rules do not apply to Aviva plc in the period ended 31 December 2010 because the Group is a qualifying financial services group in the period.
b Deferred tax i The balances at 31 December comprise: 2010 2009 m m Deferred tax assets 288 218 Deferred tax liabilities 1,758 1,038 Net deferred tax liability 1,470 820 ii The net deferred tax liability arises on the following items: 2010 2009 m m Long-term business technical provisions and other insurance items 1,051 1,290 Deferred acquisition costs 678 662 Unrealised gains on investments 1,465 915 Pensions and other post-retirement obligations 91 100 Unused losses and tax credits 713 824 Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 9 7 Intangibles and additional value of in-force long-term business 656 766 Provisions and other temporary differences 517 684 Net deferred tax liability 1,470 820 iii The movement in the net deferred tax liability was as follows: 2010 2009 m m Net liability at 1 January 820 421 Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries 44 22 Amounts charged to profit note 13a 398 254 Amounts charged to other comprehensive income note 13b 146 196 Exchange differences 7 37 Other movements 69 36 Net liability at 31 December 1,470 820 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.
Where this is the case, the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 2,150million 2009: 2,975 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 185 million will expire within the next 15 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 384 million 2009: 462 million.
Of these, 35 million will expire within the next 15 years.
The remaining capital losses have no expiry date.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings of 140 million 2009: 144 million associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates because the Group can control the timing of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences represent the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries in respect of which a tax liability may still arise on remittance of those earnings to the UK, principally as a result of overseas withholding taxes on dividends.
