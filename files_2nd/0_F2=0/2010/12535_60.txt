Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 77 9.
Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
The 2010 impairment charge relates to the Scott and Balmoral fields in the UK 2009: Chinguetti field in Mauritania and arose mainly as a result of a significant increase in estimated future decommissioning costs.
The impairment charge was calculated by comparing the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows were estimated using a long-term Brent crude oil price of US$75 bbl 2009: US$70 bbl and were discounted using a discount rate of 10 per cent 2009: 10 per cent.
Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves, future oil and gas prices and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
