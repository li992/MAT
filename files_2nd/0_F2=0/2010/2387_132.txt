Events after the reporting period continued An application was brought in the English High Court on 1 February 2011 by Alfa Petroleum Holdings Limited APH and OGIP Ventures Limited OGIP against BP International Limited and BP Russian Investments Limited.
APH is a company owned by Alpha Group.
APH and OGIP each own 25% of TNK-BP, in which BP also has a 50% shareholding.
This application alleges breach of the shareholders agreement on the part of BP and seeks an interim injunction restraining BP from taking steps to conclude, implement or perform the previously announced transactions with Rosneft Oil Company relating to oil and gas exploration, production, refining and marketing in Russia.
Those transactions include the issue or transfer of shares between Rosneft Oil Company and any BP group company.
The court granted an interim order restraining BP from taking any further steps in relation to the Rosneft transactions pending an expedited UNCITRAL arbitration procedure in accordance with the shareholders agreement between the parties.
The arbitration has commenced and the injunction has been extended until 11 March 2011 pending an expedited hearing in relation to matters in dispute between the parties on a final basis during the week commencing 7 March 2011.
The expedited hearing will decide, among other matters, whether the injunction will be extended beyond 11 March 2011.
Segmental analysis The groups organizational structure reflects the various activities in which BP is engaged.
In 2010, BP had two reportable segments: Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing.
BPs activities in low-carbon energy are managed through our Alternative Energy business, which is reported in Other businesses and corporate.
The group is managed on an integrated basis.
Exploration and Productions activities include oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production: midstream transportation, storage and processing: and the marketing and trading of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas LNG, together with power and natural gas liquids NGLs.
BP announced that in 2011 it intends to organize its Exploration and Production segment in three functional divisions Exploration, Developments and Production, integrated through a Strategy and Integration organization.
This will not affect the groups reportable segments and Exploration and Production will continue to be reported as a single operating segment.
Refining and Marketings activities include the supply and trading, refining, manufacturing, marketing and transportation of crude oil, petroleum and petrochemicals products and related services.
Other businesses and corporate comprises the Alternative Energy business, Shipping, the groups aluminium business, Treasury which in the segmental analysis includes all of the groups cash, cash equivalents and associated interest income, and corporate activities worldwide.
The Alternative Energy business is an operating segment that has been aggregated with the other activities within Other businesses and corporate as it does not meet the materiality thresholds for separate segment reporting.
In 2010, following the Gulf of Mexico incident, we established the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization GCRO and equipped it with dedicated resources and capabilities to manage all aspects of our response to the incident.
This organization reports directly to the group chief executive and is overseen by a specific new board committee, however it is not an operating segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in Note 1.
However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.
For BP, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest a and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss inventory holding gains and losses.
Replacement cost profit or loss for the group is not a recognized GAAP measure.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.
Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments.
These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the seller.
The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of Refining and Marketing.
All surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate.
However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the other operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.
Certain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for BP, and for the UK as this is BPs country of domicile.
a Inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the average cost to BP of supplies acquired during the period and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out FIFO method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost.
Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historic cost of purchase, or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost.
In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income.
The amounts disclosed represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions and the charge that would have arisen if an average cost of supplies was used for the period.
For this purpose, the average cost of supplies during the period is principally calculated on a monthly basis by dividing the total cost of inventory acquired in the period by the number of barrels acquired.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss.
No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions.
