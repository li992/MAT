Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 36 noteS to the AccountS for the 52 weeks ended 2 may 2010 1 Accounting policies Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 2 May 2010 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 30 June 2010.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 2 May 2010 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, Greene King Finance plc.
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated, from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the exceptions noted below: IFRS 2 Share-based Payments Vesting Conditions and Cancellations The amended standard changes the definition of vesting conditions and prescribes the accounting treatment of an award that is effectively cancelled due to non-vesting conditions not being satisfied.
The adoption of the amendment has had no material impact on the groups results or financial position.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
These disclosures have been incorporated in the consolidated accounts for the year ended 2 May 2010.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments The standard includes revised requirements for the identification, measurement and disclosure of segment information.
The group has determined that its operating segments are the same as had previously been disclosed in accordance with IAS 14.
The revised disclosures are included within note 2.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements The revised standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income which presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
The group has elected to present two statements, showing profit for the period and total comprehensive income respectively.
Changes in total equity which are attributable to the owners of the parent company in their capacity as such are shown directly in the statement of changes in equity outside total comprehensive income.
IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs The revised standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to an asset that necessarily takes a substantial amount of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.
The adoption of the revised standard has had no impact on the groups results or financial position.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the assets including previously unrecognised intangible assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, and is stated at cost less any impairment in value.
For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill is allocated at operating segment level which is the lowest group of cash-generating units where goodwill is monitored by management.
Allocation is based on expectations of where benefits from the synergies of the combination will result.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to 20 years.
financial Statements Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 37 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment continued Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Profit or loss on fide-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is included in the income statement in the year of fide-recognition.
impairment Property, plant and equipment Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated using the identified cash flows of the asset groups.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
financial assets Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are fide-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 38 noteS to the AccountS for the 52 weeks ended 2 may 2010 1 Accounting policies continued Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement in the same period.
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount on the face of the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations, less past service costs not yet recognised, and less the fair value of scheme assets.
Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Post-employment healthcare benefit The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded.
The cost of providing these benefits is determined on the same basis as the defined benefit pension schemes.
Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
financial Statements Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 39 1 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments continued No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS.
However later modifications of such equity instruments are measured using IFRS 2. own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products.
Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current the portion relating to the next financial period or non-current prepayments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 40 noteS to the AccountS for the 52 weeks ended 2 may 2010 1 Accounting policies continued new standards and interpretations not applied A number of standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are expected to be applied as follows: IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised effective 1 July 2009 The revisions to the standard will result in significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring in future accounting periods.
Changes affect how transactions costs are accounted for, the valuation of non-controlling interests, the initial and subsequent measurement of contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages.
The changes will impact the level of goodwill recognised, the results reported in the period of acquisition and future reported results.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Amendment effective 1 July 2009 The amendments to the standard require that a change in ownership interest of a subsidiary, that does not result in a loss of control, is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.
Such transaction will no longer therefore give rise to goodwill, or give rise to a gain or loss.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: Impairment of property, plant and equipment The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating unit that the assets are grouped within.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 13.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the groups share-based payment plans.
Note 8 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values.
In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
financial Statements Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 41 2 Segment information The group has determined four reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according to the nature of products and services provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers.

During the year the group received a refund of 7m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines which has been recognised as exceptional income.
The decisions that resulted in this refund have been referred to the European Court of Justice and should HMRC be successful in their appeal the group would be required to repay the refund with interest, and as such this represents a contingent liability.
An exceptional gain of 6.8m net of associated costs has been recognised.
The share-based payments credit results from the reversal of the previously recognised expense of share-based payment schemes which are no longer expected to meet their performance criteria.
The net profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 1.0m 2009: 3.7m comprises a total profit on disposal of 5.0m 2009: 11.1m and a total loss on disposal of 4.0m 2009: 7.4m.
Exceptional finance costs During the year ended 2 May 2010 the group repurchased securitised debt with a nominal value of 30.3m recognising a net gain of 13.5m.
Following the receipt of the proceeds of the rights issue and the subsequent repurchase of securitised debt certain interest swaps were no longer deemed to be effective hedges.
An exceptional cost of 12.1m was recognised in the prior period in respect of the fair value of interest rate swaps no longer qualifying for hedge accounting at 3 May 2009.
All ineffective swaps were cancelled during the period to 2 May 2010 resulting in an exceptional charge of 3.3m.
Exceptional tax The tax credit charge on indexation of properties represents the tax impact of movements in RPI during the period on the tax base cost of properties.
The Finance Act 2008 abolished allowances on industrial buildings and hotels on a phased basis which resulted in an exceptional deferred tax credit of 0.7m in the prior period.

In the prior period executive share option plans ESOS have also been operated.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors remuneration report on pages 78 to 81.
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions is 1.7m 2009: credit of 3.1m, all of which relates to equity-settled transactions.
This includes a charge of 1.7m 2009: 0.6m included within operating costs and an exceptional credit of nil 2009: 3.7m.
The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of the grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2010 LTIP SAYE Weighted average share price 412p 415p Exercise price 349p Expected dividend yield 4.7% 4.7% Risk-free rate of return 1.9% 2.0% Volatility 49.0% 49.3% Expected life years 3.0 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 358p 133p 2009 LTIP ESOS SAYE Weighted average share price 502p 560p 438p Exercise price 560p 341p Expected dividend yield 4.3% 4.3% 4.3% Risk-free rate of return 3.1% 4.5% 1.7% Volatility 38.5% 26.2% 44.6% Expected life years 3.0 6.5 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 416p 66p 110p Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
The SIP shares are issued to employees after the period end at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
As such, this is their fair value and the assumptions stated above are not relevant for this scheme.

Therefore, the weighted average exercise price for rights outstanding at the beginning and end of the period, granted, forfeited and exercised during the period is nil 2009: nil.
ESOS, SAYE and LTIP Options were exercised on a range of dates.
The weighted average share price through the period was 431p in 2010 and 454p in 2009.
The rights outstanding at 2 May 2010 under the LTIP had an exercise price of nil 2009: nil and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.9 years 2009: 1.8 years.
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 370p and 1087p 2009: 370p and1087p and for the SAYE scheme between 274p and 694p 2009: 341p and 865p.
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 6.3 years for the ESOS 2009: 7.3 years and 3.1 years for the SAYE scheme 2009: 3.3 years.
financial Statements Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 47 9 Pensions The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and a number of defined benefit schemes.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs after employment.
The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company.
The total cost recognised in operating profit for the period was 1.6m 2009: 1.5m.
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations in the last four years: Greene King Pension Scheme closed 2 May 1997, last valued 5 April 2006, Morland Pension Scheme closed 12 December 2000, last valued 5 April 2006, Belhaven Pension Scheme closed 31 October 2005, last valued 4 May 2008, and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme closed 1 July 2003, last valued 30 April 2006.
During the prior period the Tolly Cobbold Pension Scheme closed 29 July 2002, last valued 1 December 2004 merged with the Greene King Pension Scheme.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the groups finances and are administered by pension trustees.
Pension benefits are related to members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of comprehensive income.

Factors that may affect future tax charges On 22 June 2010 the Government announced a reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011 and a 1% reduction each year thereafter to 24% from 1 April 2014.
It is estimated that this will result in a reduction in the deferred tax liability of approximately 4.5m in next years financial statements.
The Government also announced a reduction in the rate of capital allowances from 20% to 18% and from 10% to 8% on fixtures.
The changes to capital allowances will have no impact on the total tax charge in the financial statements.

12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of 79.9m 2009: 39.5m by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period excluding own shares held of 211.3m 2009: 166.6m.
The weighted average number of shares in issue for the prior period of 133.7m has been restated to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue that occurred in the period using a bonus factor of 1.246.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 0.9m 2009: 0.7m dilutive potential shares under option, giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 212.2m 2009: 167.5m.
Where the average share price during the year is lower than the option price or the performance conditions of the option had not been met at the balance sheet date the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of options where the average share price was lower than the option price was 2.4m 2009: 2.6m, the number of options that were anti-dilutive as a result of performance conditions not being met was 2.5m 2009: 2.5m.

13 Goodwill m cost At 4 May 2008 and 3 May 2009 673.8 Acquired through business combinations note 17 5.9 At 2 may 2010 679.7 All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations.
As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 259.5m 2009: 236.4m to Retail, 152.3m 2009: 172.3m to Pub Partners, 138.7m 2009: 138.7m to Brewing Company, and 129.2m 2009: 126.4m to Belhaven.
During the year the classification of goodwill between operating segments was adjusted to reflect how assets, to which the goodwill relates, have been reorganised between cash generating units.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used for all operating segments are: the pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9.0% 2009: 9.0%, which is based on the groups weighted average cost of capital and is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted cost of capital of the relevant operating segment: and the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets are extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2.0% 2009: 2.0% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to market growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for pre-tax discount rate and growth rate.
Neither a 1% decrease in assumed growth rate nor a 1% increase in the discount rate applied would have led to an impairment of goodwill in the current period.
Other assets relate to property, plant and equipment associated with unlicensed properties i. e. brewing, distribution, and central assets.
The net book value of land and buildings comprises: 2010 2009 m m Freehold properties 1,693.9 1,657.9 Leasehold properties 50 years unexpired term 64.4 65.9 Leasehold properties 50 years unexpired term 24.9 26.4 1,783.2 1,750.2 valuation The licensed estate properties were valued by the groups own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, on the basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards.
A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
charges over assets Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 1,448.1m 2009: 1,475.3m over which there is a first charge in favour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 22. financial Statements Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 53 14 Property, plant and equipment continued Future capital expenditure 2010 2009 m m Contracted for 2.7 3.6 Impairment of property, plant and equipment During the year 37.3m of impairment losses 2009: 53.5m were recognised in the income statement as exceptional costs.
These are analysed between the groups principal reporting segments as shown below: 2010 2009 m m Retail 13.8 30.0 Pub Partners 19.1 15.5 Belhaven 1.9 5.0 Corporate 2.5 3.0 37.3 53.5 The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit CGU.
Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9% 2009: 9% and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% 2009: 2% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
The impairment recognised in the Retail, Pub Partners and Belhaven estates is primarily the result of the reduced trading performance of a relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site specific trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK consumer environment seen in the year.
The impairment losses recognised within the Corporate estate are primarily as a result of the reduction in the fair value less costs to sell of unlicensed properties acquired as part of business combinations in previous years.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Increased impairment resulting from a 1% increase in discount: m Retail 3.1 Pub Partners 3.2 Belhaven 0.4 Corporate 6.7 Increased impairment resulting from a 1% reduction in growth rate: m Retail 2.8 Pub Partners 2.6 Belhaven 0.3 Corporate 5.7 Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 54 noteS to the AccountS for the 52 weeks ended 2 may 2010 15 Financial assets non-current 2010 2009 m m Trade loans net of provision 40.3 39.0 Investments 1.5 1.3 41.8 40.3 Trade loans are net of provisions of 4.6m 2009: 4.7m, which represents the totality of impaired debt.
During the year 0.4m 2009: 1.2m of the provision was utilised and 0.3m 2009: 2.0m of new provision created.
All trade loans, net of any provision recognised, are considered to be neither past due nor impaired.
Trade loans are advanced to customers on terms linked to supply terms such that returns are greater than interest income.
The fixed rate trade loans amounted to 29.2m 2009: 28.4m and variable rate trade loans amounted to 15.7m 2009: 15.3m.
Included in fixed rate loans are 13.0m of loans with settlement related to purchase levels 2009: 14.1m.
The write-down of these loans has been taken on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the settlement.

Interest payable is mainly settled monthly, quarterly or semi-annually throughout the year, in accordance with the terms of the related financial instrument.
The group has facilities of 25m 2009: 25m available with interest linked to base rate.
bank loans unsecured The group has a five-year revolving credit facility, signed on 26 April 2008 and amended on 30 June 2008, of 400m 2009: 400m, of which nil 2009: 245m was drawn at the year end.
Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although any individual draw-downs are repayable within twelve months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the 400m facility until April 2012.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
The interest rate for the 2009 drawings of 245m was 4.45%, after the effect of swaps.
Securitised debt The group has issued various tranches of bonds totalling 1,500.0m, in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the groups pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
This assumes refinancing of the notes on the margin step-up dates detailed in the offering circular and available on the groups website.
Includes the effect of interest rate swaps.
Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, within the date ranges shown above.
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
financial Statements Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 57 22 Borrowings continued Securitised debt continued The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class AB1 and Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The Class AB1 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
loan notes unsecured The group issued loan notes during 2006 in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition.
These have a maturity date of September 2011 and bear interest at a margin below LIBOR, payable semi-annually.
The effective interest rate of the loan notes is 0.30% 2009: 4.58% after taking into consideration the effect of interest rate swaps.
These loan notes are redeemable on demand of the holders on any of the interest payment dates and as such have been classified as current debt.
During 2008 the group issued 14.4m of new loan notes with a maturity date of August 2009 in connection with the Loch Fyne acquisition.
During the year all of the loan notes were redeemed and therefore at the year end nil were outstanding 2009: 0.3m.
23 Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash and short-term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and financing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 2 May 2010 and 3 May 2009.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as G interest rates move: gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group: and G cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end.
An explanation for the split between those G hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax by approximately 0.2m 2009: 4.5m and the groups equity by 91.6m 2009: 93.2m.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
The groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2009: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than one month.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 58 noteS to the AccountS for the 52 weeks ended 2 may 2010 23 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk continued The table below summarises the maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities at 2 May 2010 and 3 May 2009 based on contractual undiscounted payments including interest.
Receivable balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging At 2 May 2010 the group held no interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges of the cash flow interest rate risk of the groups variable rate borrowings excluding bonds.
At 3 May 2009, the group held four interest rate swap contracts, with a nominal value of 198.0m, and were designated as hedges of the cash flow interest rate risk of 198.0m of the groups variable rate borrowings excluding bonds, and were held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 15.1m.
The cash flows occurred quarterly, semi-annually or monthly, receiving a variable rate of interest based on the base rate or LIBOR, which ranged from 4.58% to 5.79%, and paid a fixed rate ranging from 4.50% to 5.79%.
Remaining contract maturity dates ranged from June 2009 to October 2011.
At 2 May 2010, the group held five 2009: three interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 728.6m 2009: 763.1m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation tap.
A fair value net liability of 108.8m 2009: 129.4m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against 728.6m 2009: 763.1m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 5.101% 2009: 5.091%.
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
In the prior year cash flow hedges in respect of 50.0m 2009: 148m of the groups variable rate borrowings and 22.4m 2009: nil of the securitised debt were prospectively discontinued as a result of the pending rights issue and subsequent debt repurchase.
Accordingly in the prior year an exceptional cost of 12.1m was recognised in respect of the fair value of these interest rate swaps no longer qualifying for hedge accounting.
All ineffective swaps were cancelled during the year ended 2 May 2010 resulting in a further exceptional charge to the income statement of 3.3m.
The remaining interest rate swaps have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
The net unrealised gain of 20.3m 2009: 144.2m loss in respect of effective interest rate swaps was included in equity in respect of these contracts.
Losses recycled to the income statement in respect of swap terminations amounted to 3.3m 2009: 5.3m and are included within exceptional finance costs.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 98.7% 2009: 97.5% in line with the groups policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.
financial Statements Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 59 23 Financial instruments continued interest rate risk The following tables set out the groups exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity profile for each class of interest-bearing financial asset and financial liability.
The interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included in the above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
fair values Set out in the table overleaf is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount stated in the accounts.
Financial assets these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt: approximates to the carrying amount in the case of the floating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps fair values and effective interest rates of derivatives and other borrowings have been based on quotations from counterparties and represent estimates of the amount the group would expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to derive fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

capital risk management The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost of capital WACC and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels together referred to as capital, as appropriate in the light of economic and trading conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including fixed charged cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and free cash flow debt service coverage.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance costs before exceptional items note 7.
For the period to 2 May 2010 interest cover was 2.4x 2009: 2.2x.
