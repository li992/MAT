For the year ended 31 December 2010, the effective borrowing rate was 14% 2009: 2.8%, 2008: 2.8%.
The significant increase in the year is due to the Jubilee FPSO Kwame Nkrumah being recognised as a finance lease in accordance with IAS 17, Leases.

During 2010 a review of all decommissioning estimates was undertaken by an independent specialist and the 2010 financial statements now include estimates in accordance with this study.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.
