the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
the key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
the rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all cash generating units is 9.5% 2009: 9.5%.
a 10% change in the discount rate identified no triggers of impairment.
the recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows over a fifteen year period, being managements expectation of the useful life of the existing asset base.
the Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years.
the expected sales reflect managements expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
the expected profit margin reflects managements experience of each cash generating units profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of the restructuring programme, where appropriate.
Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.2% 2009: 3.1%, being the historical weighted average growth in Gdp in the markets that the Group operates in.
this rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
the Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each cash generating units carrying value.
a cut in the sales growth rate by seven percentage points would result in the carrying value of goodwill for the Group being reduced to its recoverable amount.

the Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
an allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Derivative financial instruments continued the Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows.
the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
the contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
the unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2010 or 2009. in accordance with iFrs 7 improving disclosures about Financial instruments, the Groups financial instruments are considered to be classified as level 2 instruments.
Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
the Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group policy.
However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.
during the year the Groups foreign currency denominated cross currency swaps either matured and were not rolled over or unwound.

treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the board.
the Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
the use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the board, where the effect is to minimise risk for the Group.
speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted.
there has been no significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
business review : Corporate GovernanCe : aCCounts bodyCote annual report 2010 75 notes to tHe Consolidated FinanCial stateMents year ended 31 deCeMber 2010 20.
Derivative financial instruments continued liquidity risk liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business.
this risk is monitored on a centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the board each december and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year.
to mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt levels, requires committed facilities plus term loans in excess of one year to exceed net debt by 50%.
the Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy.
the Group manages longer-term liquidity through committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
Following the completion of the 110m revolving Credit Facility and the $20m revolving and letter of Credit facility on 8 january 2010 and 18 February 2010 respectively, the Groups principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates: 110m revolving Credit Facility 31 March 2013 2.2 years 125m revolving Credit Facility 31 july 2013 2.6 years $20m revolving and letter of Credit Facility 31 March 2013 2.2 years in addition, cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings.
as at 31 december 2010, the Group had gross cash of 23.5m 2009: 19.6m.
interest rate risk interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances and derivative liabilities and assets which are at floating interest rates.
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Groups net profit.
under the Groups interest rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Groups major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure.
the major interest rate risk is to uK rates but exposures also exist to rates in the usa, europe and sweden.
Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the Groups reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the board uses this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
as at 31 december 2010, 3% of net debt was at fixed rates 2009: 3%.
the average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 5.2 years 2009: 3.9 years.
Currency risk bodycote has operations in 26 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
over 89% of the Groups sales are in currencies other than sterling eur 38%, usd 29%, seK 7% and brl 5%.
Cumulatively over the year, sterling rates moved such that the sales for the year were 0.3m worse than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2009. it is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
the Groups balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets.
However, where appropriate, the Group will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets.
the Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt in us dollar, euro and swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Groups assets.
the Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances.
as a result of the Groups change of balance sheet translation policy, 84.6m of cross currency swap liabilities existing at 31 december 2009 were either cancelled or not rolled over at maturity, during the year.
transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency different from the functional currency of the entity concerned.
it is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.
even though approximately 89% of the Groups sales are generated outside the uK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.
market risk sensitivity analysis the Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 december 2010, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
the sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
76 bodyCote annual report 2010 business review : Corporate GovernanCe : aCCounts 20.
Derivative financial instruments continued interest rate sensitivity the interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are recognised at their fair value: and changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable net cash or net borrowings at 31 december 2010 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately 0.5m 2009: 0.9m.
there is no significant impact on equity.
Currency sensitivity taking the 2010 sales by currency, a 10% weakening strengthening in the 2010 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling would have given rise to a 50m -41m movement in sales respectively.
the impact on headline operating profit is affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.
However, taking the 2010 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening strengthening in 2010 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a 6m -5m movement in headline operating profit.
Counterparty risk Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time deposits and money market funds.
the Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of aa3 or better.
However, acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings.
business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.
