Financial instruments The Companys principal financial instruments other than derivatives comprise bank loans, investments, cash and short-term deposits.

Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for on timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date on a nondiscounted basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
com 139 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS 35 Accounting policies continued Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits For current employees, the Company either makes payments on behalf of employees into a defined contribution scheme which the Company has set up, or makes direct payments to employees who may then make their own arrangements.
A defined contribution scheme is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate legal entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement when they are due.
The Company previously operated a defined benefit scheme which was settled during 2008.
Share-based payments Equity settled schemes From the grant date the fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
Cash settled schemes The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as a personnel expense in the income statement.
During the year the Directors took the policy decision that all award schemes will be satisfied by equity shares for the foreseeable future.
As a result the balance on the liability for own shares relating to previously cash settled schemes was transferred to the reserve for own shares.
Basis of fair value The fair value of each option or share appreciation right is determined using either a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo projection model, depending on the type of the award.
Market related performance conditions are reflected in the fair value of the share.
Non-market related performance conditions are allowed for using a separate assumption about the number of awards expected to vest: the final charge made reflects the numbers actually vested on the basis that non-market conditions are met.
Share options and own shares held In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 National Insurance Contributions on Share Option Gains UITF 25, the Company provides in full for the employers national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options granted.
As required under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts UITF 38, the cost to the Company of own shares held is shown as a deduction from shareholders funds within the profit and loss account.
Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Dividend reinvestment program Under the Companys Dividend Reinvestment Plan, shareholders can elect for the whole of their cash dividends to be reinvested in Lonmin Plc shares which are purchased on their behalf in the market.
All cash dividends are paid to the Registrars who use the dividends of participants in the plan to fund these purchases.
Accordingly, no new shares are issued, dividends are paid and accounted for in the normal way, and there are no special accounting requirements for the programme.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the Company using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic rate.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available for sale financial assets which are recognised directly in equity.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure All exploration expenses relate to pre-feasibility work and, in line with Group policy, are expensed as incurred.
