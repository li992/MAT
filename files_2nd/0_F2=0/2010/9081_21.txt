The undiscounted cash flows of these financial instruments are not materially different from their carrying values.
In addition, there were non-interest-earning financial liabilities comprising trade and other payables of 230.5m 2009: 216.4m which were payable within one year.
The Group had unutilised committed banking facilities of 78.3m at 31 December 2010 2009: 88.4m.
This mainly comprised the unutilised portion of the Groups 170m facility which expires on 16 April 2015.

Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Derivatives The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swaps is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
In 2010 and in 2009, the valuation methods of all of the Groups derivative financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised as Level 2.
Level 2 is defined as inputs, other than quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.

The impact of interest rate swaps has been included in this calculation.
It is estimated that a general increase of ten percentage points in the value of sterling against other principal foreign currencies would have decreased the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 2.2m for the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: 8m.
This sensitivity relates to the impact of retranslation of foreign earnings only.
