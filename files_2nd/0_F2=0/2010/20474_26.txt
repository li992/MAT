Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would have been paid on the respective shareholding and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made as stated in the Remuneration report.
