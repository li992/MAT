EMPLOYEE ShARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Scottish and Southern Energy Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Details of these schemes, all of which are equity-settled, are as follows: i Savings-related share option schemes Sharesave This scheme gives employees the option to purchase shares in the Company at a discounted market price, subject to the employees remaining in employment for the term of the agreement.
Employees may opt to save between 5 and 250 per month for a period of 3 or 5 years.
At the end of this period, the employees have six months to exercise their options by using the cash saved including a bonus equivalent to interest.
If the option is not exercised, the funds may be withdrawn by the employee and the option expires.
ii Share incentive Plan SiP This scheme allows employees the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company on a monthly basis.
Employees may nominate an amount between 10 and 125 to be deducted from their gross salary.
This is then used to purchase shares partnership shares in the market on the final business day of each month.
These shares are then held in trust for a period of 5 years, at which point they are transferred at no further cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during the 5 years, but tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
In addition to the shares purchased on behalf of the employee, the Company will also match the purchase up to a maximum of 6 previously 5 shares matching shares per month.
Again these shares are held in trust for the five years until they are transferred to the employee.
If an employee leaves during the first three years, or removes his her partnership shares, these matching shares are forfeited.
In addition to the above, the following special awards of free shares have been made: Award made 31 March 2005 31 March 2007 31 March 2008 Free shares per employee 50 20 10 Date at which employee must still be employed to receive award in addition to 31 March 20 August 2005 30 May 2007 1 August 2008 These awards were made to all employees in recognition of their contribution to the success of the Company.
Under the arrangements for the awards, the shares will be held in trust for five years, at which point they will be transferred to the employees at no cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during years four and five, but income tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
iii Deferred bonus scheme This scheme applied to senior managers and executive Directors.
Those eligible were awarded shares based on performance in the year.
These shares were purchased shares and are held in trust on behalf of the employee for a period of three years, at which point the employee is entitled to exercise the award.
In addition to shares purchased using the adjusted bonus award, additional shares will also be purchased by the Trustee using amounts received equivalent to any dividends which would have been received on the shares held by the trust.
If the employee resigns, they lose all outstanding awards.
This scheme has been replaced by the current Annual Bonus Scheme.
Under this scheme, 25% of all eligible employees annual bonus is deferred into shares which only vest after three years, subject to continued service.
The number of shares awarded is determined by dividing the relevant pre-tax bonus amount by the share price shortly after the announcement of the results for the financial year to which the bonus relates.
iv Performance Share Plan This scheme applies to executive Directors and senior executives.
The level of these awards are subject to certain performance conditions over the three year performance period, which can be summarised as follows: Award made 26 July 2007 10 June 2008 30 June 2009 Maximum value of award as a % of base salary 150 150 150 Performance conditions Total shareholder return 50% of award i Full vesting 75th percentile 75th percentile 75th percentile 25% vesting median median median Earnings per share 50% of award ii Full vesting RPI 9% RPI 9% RPI 9% 25% vesting RPI 3% RPI 3% RPI 3% Scottish and Southern Energy 1 30 Annual Report 2010 Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 27.
EMPLOYEE ShARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued These awards will vest after three years to the extent that certain performance conditions are met.
i T otal Shareholder Return TSR target relative to other FTSE 100 companies over the performance period.
Pro rata vesting will take place between the median and 75th percentile, with no vesting if the minimum target is not met.
ii Under the EPS perf ormance condition, pro rata vesting between 3% and the upper level above RPI, with no vesting if the minimum EPS growth target is not achieved.
As allowed by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002, which were unvested at 1 January 2005, have been included.
A charge of 17.9m 2009 14.3m was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these schemes.
The weighted average share price of forfeitures is the option price to which the forfeit relates.
Of the outstanding options at the end of the year, none were exercisable.

The fair value of shares in the share incentive plan is not subject to valuation using the Black-Scholes model.
However, the fair value of shares granted in the year is equal to the weighted average price and is based on the price paid for the shares at the grant date as shares are acquired out of the market as at that date to satisfy awards made under the scheme.
