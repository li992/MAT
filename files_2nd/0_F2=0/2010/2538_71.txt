The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken direct to equity of 1.3m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since the inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the group statement of comprehensive income before 4 October 2004.
Normal contributions of 4.7m and additional contributions of 13.5m are expected to be paid into the pension schemes during the 2011 financial year.
