In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.
Provide additional disclosure when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the groups financial position and financial performance.
State that the company has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the consolidated financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors draw attention to Notes 2, 37 and 44 on the financial statements which describe the uncertainties surrounding the amounts and timings of liabilities arising from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The groups business activities, performance, position and risks are set out in this report.
The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are detailed in the appropriate sections on pages 63 to 67 and elsewhere in the notes on financial statements.
