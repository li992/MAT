Shareholder Information Payment of dividends by BACS Many Shareholders have already arranged for dividends to be paid by mandate directly to their bank or building society account.
The Company mandates dividends through the BACS Bankers Automated Clearing Services system.
The benefit to Shareholders of the BACS payment method is that the Registrar posts the tax vouchers directly to them, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the Shareholders bank or building society account.
Shareholders who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid directly to their bank or building society account and wish to benefit from this service should request the Companys Registrar to send them a Dividend Interest mandate form or alternatively complete the mandate form accompanying their dividend warrant and tax voucher in May 2011.

Online shareholder services and share dealing Shareholders may wish to take advantage of the Online enquiry service offered by the Registrar.
This service allows a Shareholder to access his her own account to verify address details and the number of shares held.
The service can be obtained on http: shares.
The Registrar also offers a share dealing service to existing Shareholders.
Sharegift We value all our Shareholders, no matter how many shares they own, but we do realise that some Shareholders hold on to small quantities of shares because they believe that the cost of selling them would make the transaction uneconomic.
A free service is available to enable Shareholders with small holdings, should they so wish, to donate their shares to charity, and gain the benefit of tax relief on this donation.
This scheme has been successfully adopted by several large quoted companies, and further details are available from the Secretary.

These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
These brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA has reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way: many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved.
Report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or visiting www.
If the calls persist, hang up.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at www.
uk pages doing regulated law alerts overseas.
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the company endorses will be included in company mailings.
