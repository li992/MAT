Under the Black-Scholes model if the dividend yield is assumed to be zero then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using either a 3 or 5 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Group's employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
