An actuarial valuation of the ITPF the triennial valuation for funding purposes was made at 31 March 2007 by Watson Wyatt Limited.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing, it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.2 per cent per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2007 the market value of the invested assets of the ITPF was 2,951 million.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 114 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 102 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service benefits for current members.
As there was no actuarial deficiency, it was agreed with the trustees that, with effect from 31 March 2007, no employer contributions are required.
The financial position of the ITPF and the level of contributions to be paid will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 and will consider the scheme as at 31 March 2010.
During the current year, the Group announced that with effect from 1 October 2010 new employees will no longer be eligible to join the UK defined benefit pension scheme but will be offered a defined contribution arrangement instead.

These liabilities are expected to crystallise over a number of years.
Redundancy and social plan costs have been discounted at 5.0 per cent.
Other provisions principally relate to commercial legal claims and disputes.
The majority of other provisions represent the fair value at acquisition of current and potential Altadis commercial disputes, litigation and duty claims arising in the normal course of business.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise within the next five years.
