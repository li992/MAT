Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information 173 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 Ore reserves And MinerAl resOurces PlatInum GrouP mEtalS estimates as at 31 December 2010 PlaTINum The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in compliance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2007.
Operations and Projects outside South Africa were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
Details of the individual operations appear in the Anglo Platinum Annual Report.
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are reported over an economic and mineable cut appropriate to the specific reef.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
Anglo American plcs interest in Anglo Platinum is 79.7%.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 contained Metal: Contained Metal is presented in metric tonnes and million troy ounces Moz.
4 Merensky reef and uG2 reef: a The BEE transaction announced with Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. was finalised during 2010 resulting in a change of the attributable and reportable Ore Reserves for Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine BRPM.
Anglo Platinums attributable percentage decreased from 50% to 33%, equivalent to a decrease of 23.2Mt -3.1Moz.
b During 2008, RPM entered into agreement to sell its interest in the Western Bushveld Joint Venture WBJV to Wesizwe.
The suspensive conditions of this agreement have been fulfilled resulting in the reporting of 0% attributable percentage of WBJV, equivalent to a decrease of 10.9Mt -1.6Moz.
5 Merensky reef and uG2 reef: The pay limits built into the basic mining equation are directly linked to the 2011 Business plan.
The pay limit is based on Cost 4 which consists of Direct Cash Cost on and off mine, Other indirect Costs and Stay in Business Capital on and off mine.
The range is a function of various factors including depth of the ore body, geological complexity, infrastructure and economic parameters.
6 Merensky reef: The reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 2.1g t and 4.4g t 4E PGE.
The decrease is mainly attributable to the BEE transaction announced -20.1Mt, -3.0Moz and re-allocation of previously reported Ore Reserves back to Mineral Resources due to a change in the mine design and scheduling mainly at Tumela and Dishaba Mine -11.1Mt, -2.4Moz.
The Proved Ore Reserve tonnage increased mainly due to an increase in confidence at BRPMs Styldrift area.
7 uG2 reef: The reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 2.0g t and 3.9g t 4E PGE.
The decrease is mainly attributable due to re-allocation of previously reported Ore Reserves back to Mineral Resources due to a change in the mine design and scheduling mainly at Tumela and Dishaba Mine -29.7Mt -6.0Moz and due to the BEE transaction announced -14.0Mt, -1.7Moz.
However the UG2 Ore Reserves were influenced positively due to increased confidence mainly at BRPM and Union Mine 39.6Mt, 5.2Moz which resulted in a significant amount of Mineral Resources being converted to Ore Reserves.
8 Platreef: The total Ore Reserves increased significantly due to a change in the economic assumptions for Mogalakwena North and Central where the 4E pay limit grade has been decreased from 1.7g t to 1.0g t due to technological advances in the processing plant and due to a change in the economic parameters.
For Sandsloot and Zwartfontein South the pay limit grade is unchanged at 1.7g t. It must be noted that a 4.5% mining loss has been applied to the total Ore Reserves.
The modifying factors account for a decrease of 28.2Mt -1.9Moz.
9 Platreef stockpiles: Mined ore being held for long-term future treatment.
These are reported separately as Proved Ore Reserves and aggregated into the summation tabulations.
Previously reported Proved primary ore stockpiles containing oxidised and calcsilicate material above 3g t are excluded from the Ore Reserve stockpile -6.1Mt, -0.7Moz and included under the Mineral Resources.
10 Alternative units Total: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2010 is: Total 1,520.8 Mton 2009: 1,449.6 Mton Total 0.109 oz ton 2009: 0.118 oz ton 11 Tailings: Operating tailings dams for current mining operations cannot be geologically assessed and therefore are not reported as part of the Ore Reserves.
At Rustenburg Mine a dormant dam has been evaluated and the tailings form part of the Ore Reserves statement.
Tailings dams Ore Reserves are reported separately as Ore Reserves and are not aggregated to the global Ore Reserve summation.
12 Main sulphide Zone: The Main Sulphide Zone is the orebody mined at Unki Mine.
The Ore Reserves for the Main Sulphide Zone relate to the Unki East mine only.
Anglo Platinum owns an effective 100% interest in Southridge Limited.
Due to increased confidence based on new information and on underground mining exposure the Proved Ore Reserves tonnage increased significantly.
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information 175 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 Ore reserves And MinerAl resOurces 1 Tonnage: Quoted as dry metric tonnes.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 contained Metal: Contained Metal is presented in metric tonnes and million troy ounces Moz.
4 Merensky reef and uG2 reef: a During 2009 the attributable interest in the Magazynskraal 3JQ Project BEE transaction announced with Bakgatla-Ba-Kgafela and Pallinghurst decreased from 74% to 20%.
74% attributable to this project was included in the 2009 Annual Report.
This has been adjusted for in the current Annual Report equivalent to a decrease of 59.6Mt -10.5 Moz.
b The BEE transaction announced with Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. was finalised during 2010 resulting in a change of the attributable and reportable Ore Reserves for Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine BRPM.
Anglo Platinums attributable percentage decreased from 50% to 33%, equivalent to a decrease of 54.2Mt -10.3 Moz.
c During 2008, RPM entered into agreement to sell its interest in the Western Bushveld Joint Venture WBJV to Wesizwe.
The suspensive conditions of this agreement have been fulfilled during the first half of 2010.
Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd RPM received Wesizwe shares as part settlement of the purchase consideration.
This results in the reporting of 26.6% attributable tonnage in the Wesizwe areas 27.0Mt, 4.6 Moz.
The previously reported Mineral Resources for WBJV are therefore excluded from the 2010 figures -16.3Mt, -2.8 Moz.
The Mineral Resources are quoted over a practical minimum mining cut suitable for the deposit known as the Resource Cut.
Previously Resources were declared over a minimum mineable width of 80cm, but investigations have confirmed that this is not viable and the minimum width has been increased to 90cm.
The Resource Cut includes geotechnical aspects in the hanging wall or footwall of the reef.
Chromitite stringers above or below the UG2 main seam or any geotechnical weak zones are included in the Resource Cut.
The minimum beam height regarding the geotechnical aspect depends on the mining method.
Anglo Platinum takes cognisance of cut-off grades, derived from information on pay limits in the mining operations.
No Mineral Resources are excluded from the 2010 declaration relative to 2009 as a result of the cut-off grade consideration.
The delineation of the Mineral Resources that meet the requirements of reasonable expectation of eventual economic extraction has been defined using the modifying factors as defined in the SAMREC code.
These include but are not limited to mineability, geological complexity, processability and economic factors such as Cost 4 pay limits.
Cost 4 pay limit consists of Direct Cash Cost on and off mine, Other indirect Costs and Stay in Business Capital on and off mine.
The minimum resource grades per reef and per operation are in all instances greater than the Cost 4 pay limit.
5 Merensky reef: a The decrease in Mineral Resources is mainly attributable to the change of the attributable percentage decrease due to the finalisation of the BEE transactions -51.3Mt, -10.9Moz and b at Union due to new information where certain areas have been transferred from Mineral Resources to Mineral Deposit -8.0Mt, -1.7Moz.
The decreases were in part offset by the increase in Mineral Resources due to new information mainly from Bokoni, Ga-Phasha and Der Brochen 37.7Mt, 8.3Moz and due to acquisition from Wesizwe 12.0Mt, 2.4Moz.
6 uG2 reef: The decrease in total Mineral Resources is mainly due to the change of the attributable percentage decrease following the finalisation of the BEE transactions -78.8Mt, -12.6Moz.
7 Platreef: A 1.0g t 4E PGE cut-off has been used to define Mineral Resources.
The decrease is due to a higher percentage of Mineral Resources being converted to Ore Reserves as a consequence of the decrease in the 4E pay limit grade from 1.7g t to 1.0g t at Mogalakwena North and Central.
Since previously reported Proved primary ore stockpiles containing oxidised and calcsilicate material above 3g t are currently not planned to be processed, they are excluded from the Ore Reserve stockpile and included under the Measured Mineral Resources 6.1Mt, 0.7Moz.
8 Alternative units Measured and indicated: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2010 is: Measured and Indicated 2,542.4 Mton 2009: 2,652.6 Mton Measured and Indicated 0.120 oz ton 2009: 0.115 oz ton 9 Tailings: Operating tailings dams for current mining operations cannot be geologically assessed and therefore are not reported as part of the Mineral Resources.
Tailings dams resources are reported separately as Mineral Resources but are not aggregated to the global Mineral Resource summation.
At Rustenburg Mine a dormant dam has been evaluated and the tailings form part of the Mineral Resource statement.
At Union the previously reported tailings dams are reactivated and as a consequence no Mineral Resources are stated.
10 Main sulphide Zone: The Main Sulphide Zone is the orebody mined at Unki Mine.
The Mineral Resources for the Main Sulphide Zone relate to the Unki East and West mines only.
Due to new information, which comprises of a significant amount of surface drilling and a re-interpretation of the geological structure, the spatial extent of the Unki project was reduced in the South and North to take cognisance of natural boundaries determined by geological structures.
Previously reported Mineral Resources lying beyond these structures which were included under the Unki Project in 2009 will be reported as Unki South pending further evaluation in 2011.
11 Anooraq-Anglo Platinum Boikgantsho: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 49%.
A cut-off of US$20.00 t gross metal value was applied for resource definition.
12 shebas ridge: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable 35% of the JV area.
A cut-off of US$10.50 t total revenue contribution from the constituent metal was used.
13 river valley: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
A cut-off of 0.7g t platinum plus palladium was applied for resource definition.
14 Pedra Branca: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 51%.
A cut-off of 0.7g t 3E PGE was applied for resource definition.
