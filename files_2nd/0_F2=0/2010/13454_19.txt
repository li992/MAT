Statement of compliance The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Board of directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 25 February 2011.
Basis of preparation On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
On 21 June 2010 the Group disposed of its 66.7% shareholding in Holiday Lettings Holdings Limited HLHL, which owned 100% of the shares in the trading entity Holiday Lettings Limited HLL, together referred to as the Holiday Lettings segment to TripAdvisor Limited.
The Group has restated the comparatives within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to reflect the Holiday Lettings segment as a discontinued operation following its disposal refer Note 11.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are in accordance with Adopted IFRSs and except as described below are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010: i Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 incorporates the following changes that may be relevant to the Groups operations: The definition of a business has been broadened, which is likely to result in more acquisitions being treated as business combinations: Contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes therein recognised in profit or loss: Transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred: Any pre-existing interest in the acquiree will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss: and Any non-controlling minority interest will be measured at either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, on a transaction by transaction basis.
Revised IFRS 3 is applied prospectively and as there have been no acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2010 there has been no impact on the financial statements or reported earnings per share.
53 rightmove plc annual report 2010 notes continued 1 General information continued ii Amended IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 requires accounting for changes in ownership interests by the Group in a subsidiary, while maintaining control, to be recognised as an equity transaction.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The amendments to IAS 27, which became mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, have not had any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern During 2009, the Group converted 25,000,000 of a revolving loan facility into a five-year term loan.
In February 2010 a decision was made to repay the term loan early thereby extinguishing the debt.
Post repayment of the term loan, the Group was debt free and continued to generate significant cash and has net cash balances of 23,148,000 at 31 December 2010 2009: 3,393,000.
The Group entered into an agreement with Barclays Bank Plc for a 10,000,000 uncommitted money market loan on 15 February 2010.
No amount was drawn under this facility during the year and the loan was extended on 11 February 2011 for a further 12 month period.
The Group met all banking covenant requirements in relation to the term loan during the year.
After making enquiries, the Board of directors has a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources and banking facilities to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Board of directors continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business and Financial Review on pages 5 to 15.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Position on pages 11 to 15.
In addition Note 4 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Capital structure The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 November 2007 under the Companies Act 1985 as a private company limited by shares with the name Rightmove Group Limited, registered no.
The Company was re-registered as a public limited company under the name Rightmove Group plc on 29 November 2007.
On 28 January 2008 the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited formerly Rightmove plc, Company no.
3997679 and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The shares in the Company were admitted to trading on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 28 January 2008 and the Company immediately changed its name to Rightmove plc.
Details of the share capital of the Company are disclosed in Note 23.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Judgments and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
54 rightmove plc annual report 2010 1 General information continued In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 11 Measurement of the contingent consideration receivable in relation to the disposal of the Holiday Lettings segment regarding the estimate of future profitability Note 22 Deferred tax assets relating to the rate at which the asset will reverse and the recoverability of the asset Note 25 Measurement of share-based payments relating to the inputs to the fair value models and the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually be issued 2 Significant accounting policies a Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the Parent company financial statements.
b Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount previously recorded under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 were not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004.
IFRS 1 permits goodwill on acquisitions made before this date to be brought onto the statement of financial position at 1 January 2004 at its carrying value under UK GAAP.
ii Research and development The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property websites.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
iii Computer software and licenses Computer software and externally acquired software licenses are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software or license by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 16.7% 33.3% per annum Software licences 20.0% 33.3% per annum 55 rightmove plc annual report 2010 notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued iv Customer relationships Customer relationships are identified on the acquisition of a business and valued using discounted cash flows based on historical customer attrition rates.
Amortisation is expensed in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life as follows: Customer relationships 16.7% per annum c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Office equipment, fixtures & fittings 20.0% per annum Computer equipment 20.0% 33.3% per annum Leasehold improvements life of the lease d Impairment The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and which are not available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at the IFRS transition date: no impairment was deemed necessary.
An impairment test is performed annually at 31 December on goodwill regardless of the existence of impairment indicators.
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the Companys carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in profit or loss.
In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and the Companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables are recognised at fair value less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with borrowings.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost and any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
56 rightmove plc annual report 2010 2 Significant accounting policies continued The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts to hedge the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Group does not specifically designate forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and gains and losses are recorded directly in profit or loss.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
g Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risk specific to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
A provision is maintained in respect of vacant leasehold properties where the lease is considered to be onerous to take account of the net present value of residual lease commitments over the remaining term of the lease.
h Employee benefits i Pensions The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme into which employees may elect to contribute via salary deduction.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the profit or loss when they are due.
ii Employee share schemes The share option and deferred share plans allow certain senior management to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in the profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period to which the employees become unconditionally entitled, on equity settled share-based payment schemes granted after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
Awards made before this date are not accounted for under IFRS 2, as permitted under the transitional rules of IFRS 1.
For awards made after 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January 2005, the charge is based on the fair value of the share-based incentive granted as at the grant date, calculated using an option pricing model.
Fair value is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option behaviour, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates based on government bonds.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining the fair value.
iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reflected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
57 rightmove plc annual report 2010 notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued i Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.
j Revenue Revenue principally represents the amounts, excluding value added tax VAT, receivable from customers in respect of properties advertised on Group websites.
Revenue relating to properties advertised on the website is recognised in the month to which it relates.
Estate agency and overseas branches are billed in advance with net revenue deferred until the service commencement date.
The VAT liability is recognised at the point of invoice.
New homes developers are typically billed monthly in arrears.
Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the profit or loss on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the contract terms.
HLL revenue was billed in advance.
The majority of HLL revenue related to annual contracts although some was billed quarterly and half yearly.
This revenue was spread equally over the period until disposal with any deferred revenue held on the statement of financial position as at the disposal date.
k Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
An operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Groups Managing Director to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
l Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss.
m Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where cash is received in exchange for entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
n Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances, deposits and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised on the date that the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Financial expenses comprise debt issue costs, interest payable on bank loans and bank charges.
Interest payable is recognised on an accruals basis.
o National Insurance NI on share-based incentives Employers NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when share-based incentives are exercised.
In the case of share options it is provided on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options.
In the case of deferred shares at nil cost it is provided based on the share price at the reporting date.
p Taxation Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
58 rightmove plc annual report 2010 2 Significant accounting policies continued A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based payments is to include the income tax effect of the tax deduction in the profit or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge.
The remainder of the income tax effect of the tax deduction is recognised in equity.
q Dividends Dividends unpaid at the reporting date are only recognised as a liability and deduction to equity at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
r Earnings per share The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all potential dilutive instruments, which comprise share-based incentives granted to employees.
The calculation of underlying EPS is disclosed in Note 12. s Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale or distribution, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
3 IFRSs not yet applied A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2010 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
4 Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk operational risk This note presents information about the Group and Companys exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The primary method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board, where any significant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups internal controls and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
59 rightmove plc annual report 2010 notes continued 4 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 94.0% of the Groups customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on individually identified loss exposures.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash.
The Group and Companys approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups revenue model is largely subscription-based which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensure that they have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
Throughout the year, the Group typically had sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses on continuing operations, before financing activities, for a period of 296 days 2009: 308 days.
As at 31 December 2010 the Group had bank borrowings of nil 2009: 22,500,000.
On 10 February 2010 the loan outstanding as at 31 December 2009 was repaid in full without penalty refer Note 20.
Post repayment of the loan the Group entered into an agreement with Barclays Bank Plc for a 10,000,000 uncommitted money market loan.
To date no amount has been drawn under this facility.
The loan was extended on 11 February 2011 for a further 12 month period.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Currency risk All of the Groups sales and more than 99.0% of the Groups purchases are Sterling denominated, accordingly it has no currency risk.
Interest rate risk The Group and Company have no interest bearing financial liabilities.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash balances and amounts held in Escrow.
Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Groups processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour.
Operational risks arise from all of the Groups operations.
The Groups objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Groups reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
60 rightmove plc annual report 2010 4 Financial risk management continued The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit.
This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas: requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions: requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions: compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements: documentation of controls and procedures: requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced, and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address the risks identified: requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action: development of contingency plans: training and professional development: and risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
Capital management The Board of directors policy is to maintain an efficient statement of financial position with an appropriate level of leverage for the size of the business so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of directors considers that the future working capital and capital expenditure requirements of the Group will continue to be low and accordingly return on capital measures are not key performance targets.
The Board of directors monitors the spread of the Companys shareholders as well as underlying earnings per share.
The Board of directors has a progressive dividend policy and also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to profit growth.
As at 31 December 2010 the directors hold 2.0% 2009: 2.8% of the ordinary share capital of the Company excluding shares held in treasury.
In addition the executive directors are regarded as being interested, for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, in 5.6% 2009: 6.4% ordinary shares in the Company currently held by the EBT as they are, together with other employees, potential beneficiaries of the EBT.
The Company purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market conditions.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
5 Operating segments As from 1 January 2009, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the Managing Director, who is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Groups reportable segments are as follows: The Agency segment which provides resale and lettings property advertising services on www.
co. uk: and The New Homes segment which provides property advertising services to new home developers and Housing Associations on www.
The Other segment which represents activities under the reportable segments threshold, comprises overseas property advertising services on www.
co. uk and non-property advertising services which include business and information services and Automated Valuation Model services.
Management monitors the business segments at a revenue and trade receivables level separately for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated and of assessing performance.
All revenues in both years are derived from third parties and there are no inter-segment revenues.
61 rightmove plc annual report 2010 notes continued 5 Operating segments continued Operating costs, financial income, financial expenses and income taxes in relation to the Agency, New Homes and the Other segment are managed on a centralised basis at a Rightmove Group Limited level and as there are no internal measures of individual segment profitability relevant disclosures have been shown under the heading of Central in the table below.

The 2009 final dividend paid on 11 June 2010 was 7,586,000 being a difference of 44,000 compared to that reported in the 2009 Annual Report which was due to a reduction in the ordinary shares entitled to a dividend between 31 December 2009 and the final dividend record date of 14 May 2010.
The 2010 interim dividend paid on 12 November 2010 was 5,371,000 being a difference of 32,000 compared to that reported in the 2010 Half Year Report which was due to a reduction in the ordinary shares entitled to a dividend between 30 June 2010 and the interim dividend record date of 15 October 2010.

Impairment testing for cash generating units containing goodwill For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Groups operations which represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Groups operating segments as reported in Note 5.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each unit are as follows: 31 December 2010 31 December 2009 000 000 Holiday Lettings discontinued 12,518 Agency 732 732 732 13,250 The recoverable amount of the HLL cash generating unit in 2009 was based on its value in use.
Value in use was determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows generated from the business and was based on the following key assumptions: Cash flows were projected based on past experience, actual operating results and the three year business plan: Cash flows thereafter were extrapolated into perpetuity applying a growth rate of 2.0%: The key assumption was sales growth rate.
In 2009 revenues on a management accounts basis, before adjusting for deferred revenue, grew by 45.7% year on year and in the business plan revenues were projected based on historical growth and future plans for the business: and A pre-tax discount rate of 19.6% was applied in determining the recoverable amount: based on an industry specific weighted average cost of capital.
The carrying value of the 732,000 purchased goodwill in Agency, arising pre-transition to IFRS, is also reviewed annually for impairment.
Due to its level of significance the disclosures as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets have not been made.

This increase is due to the Companys share price increasing from 5.04 at 31 December 2009 to 7.79 at 31 December 2010.

The first 1.0% reduction was substantively enacted for the purposes of IFRS on 20 July 2010.
It has not been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 3.0% rate reduction but it is expected to result in a reduction in the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax assets accordingly resulting in a further charge to income and a debit directly to equity.
The anticipated changes to the capital allowance rules from April 2012 are considered unlikely to have a material impact on the effective rate of tax.

25 Share-based payments The Group and Company operate share-based incentive schemes for certain senior management comprising the Rightmove Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan Unapproved Plan, the Rightmove Approved Executive Share Option Plan Approved Plan and the Rightmove Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB Plan.
The Group also operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave Plan.
The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
All share-based incentive schemes are granted under a service condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service received.
The unapproved executive share option awards granted on 5 March 2010 at an exercise price of 6.66 are subject to an equal measure of TSR performance and growth in EPS.
The vesting of 50% of the 2010 award will be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three-year performance period and the vesting of the other 50% of the 2010 award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target over a three-year performance period.
The unapproved executive share option awards made on 5 March 2009 are subject to a relative TSR performance over a three-year performance period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250.
There are no market conditions associated with any other share-based incentives granted.
The IFRS 2 charge for the year relating to employee share-based incentive plans was 1,846,000 2009: 1,896,000.
Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.

The IFRS 2 charge for approved and unapproved options for the year ended 31 December 2010 is 1,318,000 2009: 1,570,000.
NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the share options are exercised, on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options.
Sharesave Plan The Group operates an Her Majestys Revenue and Customs approved Sharesave Plan under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period.
These funds are used to fund the option exercise.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the Sharesave option scheme are as follows: Employee turnover before vesting Share price Exercise Expected Risk free Dividend non-vesting Fair value at grant date price volatility Option life rate yield condition per option Grant date pence pence % years % % % pence 2 October 2006 345.75 259.00 27.0 3.25 4.5 3.0 16.0 108.00 3 October 2007 525.00 490.00 32.0 3.25 5.8 1.5 84.0 156.00 2 October 2008 253.75 255.00 32.0 3.25 3.0 1.5 25.0 59.00 1 October 2009 545.00 425.00 50.3 3.25 3.5 4.4 25.0 199.00 5 October 2010 745.50 553.00 49.0 3.25 2.3 1.6 25.0 318.00 Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.
The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave option scheme is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

DSB Plan In March 2009 a DSB Plan was established which allows certain senior management the opportunity to earn a bonus linked as a percentage of base salary settled in deferred shares.
The award of shares under the plan is contingent on the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to underlying drivers of long-term revenue growth the Performance period.
The right to the shares is deferred for two years from the date of the award the Vesting period and potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment.
The deferred share awards have been valued using the Black Scholes model and the resulting IFRS 2 charge has been spread evenly over the combined Performance period and Vesting period of the shares, being three years.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the deferred shares are released to the employees, based on the share price at the reporting date.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value of the deferred share awards are calculated at the date on which the potential bonus is communicated to senior management the Grant date as follows: Employee Share price Exercise Expected Expected Risk free Dividend turnover Fair value Award at Grant date price volatility term rate yield before vesting per share Grant date date pence pence % years % % % pence 5 March 2009 5 March 2010 226.75 nil n a 3.0 2.6 4.4 12.0 199.00 5 March 2010 677.00 nil n a 3.0 3.2 1.5 12.0 648.00 Following the achievement of the 2009 internal performance targets, 215,958 deferred shares were awarded to senior management on 5 March 2010 the Award date with the right to the release of the shares deferred until March 2012.
