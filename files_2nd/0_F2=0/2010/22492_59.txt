Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2010 91 Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances which have an original maturity of three months or less, together with highly liquid investments.
The portfolio of floating rate notes classified as available for sale were reclassified during the prior period for cash flow presentation purposes since the majority of the portfolio had been hedged as collateral for sale and repurchase agreements and the market for those instruments was no longer regarded as highly liquid due to the prevailing economic environment.
Financial risk management As a diversified group of financial services businesses, financial instruments are central to the groups activities.
The risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the group and are analysed in more detail below.
The groups financial risk management objectives are summarised within Internal control and risk management in the Corporate Governance section on pages 33 and 34.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements.
a Classification The tables below analyse the groups financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with the categories of financial instruments in IAS 39.

Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities where prices are readily available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency to provide ongoing pricing information.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly, as prices, or indirectly, derived from prices: Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
indd 92 29 9 10 20:51:47 Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2010 93 The groups financial instruments which are held at fair value are analysed in the following table at the balance sheet date.
Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 million million million million At 31 July 2010 Assets Debt securities: Long trading positions in debt securities 54.1 44.4 9.7 Floating rate notes classified as available for sale 615.4 615.4 Gilts and government guaranteed debt classified as available for sale 285.6 285.6 Equity shares: Classified as held for trading 31.5 31.5 Available for sale 22.7 3.7 7.8 11.2 Valued at fair value through profit or loss 5.7 5.7 Derivative financial instruments 23.0 23.0 1,038.0 365.2 655.9 16.9 Liabilities Short positions: In debt securities 48.6 43.4 5.2 In equity shares 18.4 18.4 Derivative financial instruments 20.5 20.5 87.5 61.8 25.7 Instruments classified as Level 1 predominantly comprise G10 government securities and listed equity shares.
Investments classified as Level 2 predominantly comprise investment grade corporate bonds, less liquid listed equities and over the counter derivatives.
Investments classified as Level 3 predominantly comprise investments in private equity funds and unlisted equity shares.
Level 3 equity shares represent investments made in unlisted fixed income and property funds and private equity limited partnership interests.
For fund investments, the most recent net asset value as calculated and reported by the fund manager is the basis of the valuations.
Private equity partnership interests are valued using semi-annual valuations of the individual portfolio holdings held by each partnership, in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Under these guidelines, new investments are generally valued at cost for the first year.
Thereafter valuations are typically based on a multiple of the sustainable earnings before interest and tax EBIT of each holding, such multiple derived by reference to a comparable quoted company, sector, or recent transaction, and discounted to account for differences in size, product mix, growth prospects, level of gearing, and marketability.
In addition, management applies a discount to these valuations to reflect the relative infrequency of the private equity valuations, and the illiquid nature of the portfolio.
The discount is based on an average of the discounts to net asset value observed in a population of comparable quoted private equity funds.
Management believes that there is no reasonably possible change to the inputs used in the valuation of these positions which would have a material effect on the groups income statement.
There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period.
Movements in financial assets categorised as Level 3 during the year were: Total million At 1 August 2009 23.6 1 Total gains or losses recognised in the consolidated income statement 3.8 Total gains or losses recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 0.2 Purchases and issues 0.2 Sales and settlements 10.9 At 31 July 2010 16.9 1 Transfers from the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense to the income statement on impairment of available for sale level 3 equity shares are not included in the above table.
During the year an 8.5 million transfer was made.

Financial risk management continued The gains or losses recognised in the consolidated income statement relating to instruments held at the year end amounted to 0.6 million.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations or fails to perform them in a timely fashion and arises mainly from the lending and treasury activities of the Banking division.
The groups lending activities are generally short-term in nature with low average loan size.
In addition the group applies consistent and prudent lending criteria mitigating credit risk.
The credit quality of counterparties with whom the group deposits or whose debt securities are held is monitored within approved limits.
Credit risk in the Securities division is limited as the businesses in that division trade in the cash markets with regulated counterparties on a delivery versus payment basis such that any credit exposure is limited to price movements in the underlying securities.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place.
Maximum exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 July 2010, before taking account of any collateral and credit risk mitigation, was: 2010 2009 million million Cash and balances at central banks 452.7 1.7 Settlement balances 541.7 508.7 Loans and advances to banks 158.5 196.5 Loans and advances to customers 2,912.6 2,364.9 Debt securities 1,636.2 2,299.2 Equity shares 59.9 62.0 Loans to money brokers against stock advanced 86.0 158.3 Derivative financial instruments 23.0 32.5 Undrawn commitments 539.9 329.3 Guarantees 1.4 10.9 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 6,411.9 5,964.0 Assets pledged and received as collateral The group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard securitised borrowing contracts.
The group has entered into a repurchase agreement whereby floating rate notes to the value of 553.6 million 2009: 551.6 million have been lent in exchange for cash of 401.4 million 2009: 397.7 million which has been included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
The agreement matures in November 2010 and the group has agreed to enter into a similar transaction with a maturity of November 2011.
These floating rate notes remain on the groups balance sheet and the group retains the risk and rewards of ownership.
Loans to money brokers against stock advanced are the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market-making activities.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short-term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.
The vast majority of loans and advances to customers are secured against specific assets.
The security will correspond to the type of lending as detailed in the segmental loan book analysis on page 17 of the Business Review.
Consistent and prudent lending criteria are applied across the whole loan book with emphasis on the quality of the security provided.
indd 94 29 9 10 20:51:48 Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2010 95 Financial assets Loans and advances to customers Credit risk management and monitoring Within the Banking division the overall credit risk appetite and policy is set by the Risk and Compliance Committee.
Retail, Commercial and Property each use credit underwriting and monitoring measures appropriate to the diverse and specialised nature of their lending.
Retail is typically high volume lending with a small average loan size.
Credit issues are identified early via predominantly automated tracking processes.
Remedial actions are implemented promptly to restore customers to a performing status or recovery methods are applied to minimise any potential loss.
Commercial is a combination of several niche lending businesses with a diverse mix of loans in terms of assets financed, average loan size and loan to valuation percentage.
Credit quality is assessed either on an individual loan by loan basis or a collective portfolio basis.
This approach allows remedial actions to be implemented at the appropriate time to minimise potential losses.
Property is a portfolio of higher value, low volume lending which enables credit monitoring on a loan by loan basis.
Loans are continually monitored to determine whether they are performing satisfactorily.
Performing loans with elevated levels of credit risk are placed on graded watch lists depending on the perceived severity of the credit risk.
Credit risk classification Loans and advances to customers within the Banking division, as disclosed in note 12 on pages 71 and 72, are segmented between the following categories for credit risk reporting: neither past due nor impaired: past due but not impaired: impaired.
Neither past due nor impaired The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are neither past due nor impaired.
This demonstrates the short-term nature of the lending, with 1.6 billion having a contractual maturity of less than twelve months.
These loans and advances reflect the application of consistent and conservative lending criteria on inception and the quality and level of security held.
The contractual repayments are monitored to ensure that classification as neither past due nor impaired remains appropriate.
2010 2009 Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances to customers Individually Collectively Individually Collectively assessed assessed Total assessed assessed Total million million million million million million Within one month 297.4 173.4 470.8 184.8 126.3 311.1 Between one and three months 157.1 252.8 409.9 145.8 240.8 386.6 Between three months and one year 155.6 558.8 714.4 100.3 484.6 584.9 Over one year 208.5 774.4 982.9 111.9 638.8 750.7 818.6 1,759.4 2,578.0 542.8 1,490.5 2,033.3 Past due but not impaired Loans and advances to customers are classed as past due but not impaired when the customer has failed to make a payment when contractually due but there is no evidence of impairment.
This includes loans which are individually assessed for impairment but where the value of security or collateral is sufficient to meet the required repayments.
This also includes loans to customers which are past due for technical reasons such as delays in payment processing or rescheduling of payment terms.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are past due but for which no impairment provision has been raised.

Financial risk management continued Impaired The factors considered in determining whether assets are impaired are outlined in the accounting policies in note 1 n on page 59.
Impaired loans and advances to customers are analysed according to whether the impairment provisions are individually or collectively assessed.
Individually assessed provisions are determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the financial condition of the customer and an estimate of any potential recoveries and realisation of security or collateral.
This methodology is applied by the Property lending businesses and by the invoice finance business within Commercial.
Collectively assessed provisions are considered on a portfolio basis, to reflect the homogeneous nature of the assets.
A percentage of the portfolio is impaired by evaluating the ageing of missed payments combined with the historical recovery rates for that particular portfolio.
This methodology is applied by the Retail lending businesses and the asset finance business within Commercial.
The gross impaired loans are quoted without taking account of any collateral or security held, which could reduce the potential loss.
The application of conservative loan to value ratios on inception and the emphasis on the quality of the security provided, is reflected in the low provision to gross impaired balance ratio coverage ratio of 29% 2009: 26%.
The following table shows gross impaired loans and advances to customers and the provision thereon split by assessment method.
2010 2009 Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances to customers Individually Collectively Individually Collectively assessed assessed Total assessed assessed Total million million million million million million Gross impaired loan 192.1 107.3 299.4 144.8 132.1 276.9 Provisions 58.1 29.0 87.1 39.3 31.9 71.2 Net impaired loans 134.0 78.3 212.3 105.5 100.2 205.7 The amount of interest income accrued on impaired loans and advances was 20.2 million 2009: 13.9 million.
Whilst collateral is reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with credit policy, this varies according to the type of lending, collateral involved and the status of the loan.
It is therefore impracticable to estimate and aggregate current fair values for collateral.
Settlement balances Credit risk management and monitoring The credit risk presented by settlement balances in the Securities division is limited as such balances represent delivery versus payment transactions where delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment.
The credit risk is therefore limited to the change in market price of a security between trade date and settlement date and not the absolute value of the trade.
The Securities businesses are market-makers and trade with the intention of matching demand and supply for any given security.
They trade on a principal only basis.
The Securities businesses trade only with regulated counterparties including stockbrokers, wealth managers, institutions and hedge funds who are either approved by the FSA or equivalent in the EU or US.
Credit risk classification Settlement balances are classed as neither past due nor impaired when the respective trades have not yet reached their settlement date.
Settlement balances are classed as past due but not impaired when trades fail to be settled on their contractual settlement date.
The credit risk presented by settlement balances which are past due is mitigated by the delivery versus payment mechanism, which requires counterparties to settle the open trade when market conditions allow, as well as by the Securities businesses trading only with regulated counterparties.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place as part of an overall risk management framework and settlement balances past due are actively managed.
2010 2009 Neither past Past due Neither past Past due due nor but not due nor but not impaired impaired Total impaired impaired Total Within one month 486.0 47.5 533.5 458.0 41.7 499.7 Between one and three months 4.4 4.4 4.5 4.5 Between three months and one year 1.6 1.6 3.5 3.5 Over one year 2.2 2.2 1.0 1.0 486.0 55.7 541.7 458.0 50.7 508.7 U09509 pp90 pp100.
indd 96 29 9 10 20:51:48 Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2010 97 Concentration risk and quality of financial assets Loans and advances are spread across asset classes, short-term, secured and with a low average loan size in order to avoid concentration risk in the loan book and associated collateral.
The credit quality of the counterparties with whom the group places deposits or whose debt securities the group holds is monitored by the Risk and Compliance Committee within the Banking division which establishes specific limits.
Whilst these amounts may be material, the counterparties are all regulated institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies, and fall within the large exposure limits set by the regulatory requirements.
Credit and counterparty risk, and the measures taken to mitigate or manage these risks, are considered further within the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Business Review on pages 22 to 26. d Market risk Market risk is the risk that arises from adverse movements in equity, bond, interest rate, foreign exchange or other traded markets and arises primarily in the Securities division.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the returns from its capital and reserves which, as a matter of policy, are not hedged.
The groups policy is to match fixed and variable interest rate liabilities and assets utilising interest rate swaps where necessary to secure the margin on its loans and advances to customers.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 15 on page 75.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rate scenarios, including parallel shifts in the yield curve.
At 31 July 2010 a 1.0% increase or a 0.5% decrease 2009: a 2.0% increase or a 0.5% decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups annual net interest income by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: 2010 2009 million million 1.0% increase 2009: 2.0% increase 3.1 5.1 0.5% decrease 2009: 0.5% decrease 1.6 1.3 At 31 July 2010 a 1.0% increase or a 0.5% decrease 2009: a 2.0% increase or a 0.5% decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: 2010 2009 million million 1.0% increase 2009: 2.0% increase 5.6 3.6 0.5% decrease 2009: 0.5% decrease 2.9 0.9 Foreign currency risk The group has a number of currency investments in subsidiaries and associates and has chosen not to hedge those exposures.
These investments are predominantly in US dollars and euros.
Foreign exchange differences which arise from the translation of these operations are recognised directly in equity.
At 31 July 2010 changes in exchange rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2010 2009 million million 20% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar 2009: 20% strengthening 19.4 18.0 20% strengthening of sterling against the euro 2009: 20% strengthening 8.7 8.0 The group would experience an equal and opposite increase in equity should sterling weaken against these currencies by the same percentage.
The group has additional material currency assets and liabilities primarily as a result of activities in the Banking division.
These assets and liabilities are matched by currency, using exchange rate derivative contracts where necessary.
Details of these contracts are disclosed in note 15 on page 75.
Other potential group exposures arise from share trading settled in foreign currency in the Securities division, and small foreign currency equity investments.
The group has policies and processes in place to manage foreign currency risk, and as such the impact of any reasonably expected exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.

The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
The basis on which the trading book is valued each day is given in the accounting policies in note 1 p on pages 59 and 60.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 1.3 million 2009: 1.0 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 0.6 million decrease 2009: 3.4 million increase on the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly a stock jobbing business where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the sensitivity referred to above is purely hypothetical.
Non trading financial instruments Net gains and losses on non trading financial instruments are disclosed in note 13 on pages 72 and 73.
