2 In the Budget on 22 June 2010, the UK Government proposed, amongst other things, to reduce Corporation Tax rates in four annual decrements of 1% with effect from 1 April 2011.
The first decrement was enacted in the Finance No 2 Act 2010 and as a consequence the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised at an effective rate of 27%.
The impact of this change on the tax charge for the year is set out in the table above.
