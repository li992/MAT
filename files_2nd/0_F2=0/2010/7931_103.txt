vi Hedge of net investments in foreign operations At 30 September 2010 external loans with a fair value of 5,465 million and US$1,000 million 2009: 5,294 million and US$800 million, cross currency swaps of 5,502 million 2009: 5,502 million, foreign exchange swaps of $1,750 million 2009: $nil and non-deliverable forwards of MAD1,675 million 2009: MAD1,675 million have been designated as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and derivatives are recognised as other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the Groups foreign operations.
Permanent intragroup loans with a fair value of 6,365 million 2009: 4,284 million have been treated as a reduction in investments in the Groups foreign operations.
vii Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial liabilities that are carried in the financial statements at amounts other than fair values.
All financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments that are carried at fair value.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables are approximate to their fair value and so are excluded from the analysis below.
Derivative financial instruments are excluded as they are carried at fair value.
No assets are held as available for sale.

17 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the consolidated balance sheet.

Deferred tax assets of 14 million 2009: 20 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, 11 million 2009: 11 million will expire within five years.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 90 million 2009: 77 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 7 billion 2009: 8 billion.
A provision of 8 million 2009: 9 million has been made for taxation expected to arise on a planned future dividend payment of 110 million from one subsidiary.
No other liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The June 2010 United Kingdom Budget Statement included proposals to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax by 1percent per annum from 28 per cent to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014.
The change from 28 per cent to 27 per cent was enacted at the balance sheet date and has, therefore, been included in these financial statements.
The effect of the reduction to 27 per cent has been to reduce the deferred tax liability provided at 30 September 2010 by approximately 1 million.
This 1 million decrease in the deferred tax liability has increased profit for the year by 2 million and decreased other comprehensive income by 1 million.
The proposed further reductions to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of a further reduction to 24 per cent, if applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 September, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately 4 million.
