Do more, feel better, live longer GlaxoSmithKline 2010 Review Letter to Shareholders Enhancing returns to our shareholders and improving the lives of patients and consumers Dear Shareholder Over the last two and a half years we have been implementing a strategy to transform our business model to address the significant challenges our industry faces as payers search for ever more cost-effective healthcare, and demand escalates for new and better medicines.
We are doing this with the direct aim of enhancing returns to our shareholders and improving the lives of patients and consumers.
To achieve this transformation we have substantially re-engineered GSKs business through major restructuring and a more rigorous approach to capital allocation.
The effects of these changes on our performance in 2010 were masked to some degree by specific events.
Reported sales, for example, were impacted by generic competition to Valtrex, and reduced sales from Avandia and pandemic related products.
Meanwhile earnings were impacted by the significant charge we took to help resolve long-standing legal matters.
This belies the good progress we have made to execute our strategy and which is evident in our diversified underlying sales growth excluding pandemic related products, Avandia and Valtrex and the increasing potential of GSKs pipeline.
GSK also remains financially strong.
GSKs dividend increased by 7% to 65p in 2010 and our priority is to deliver further growth in the dividend.
Since 2005, dividends have increased each year with average growth of 8% over the five-year period.
We have also started a new long-term share buy-back programme to enhance returns to shareholders, with buy-backs of 1-2 billion expected in 2011.
Creating a successful and sustainable business We have also placed great importance not just on what we achieve but on how we achieve it.
Running a responsible, values-based business is embedded in our strategy.
We know that the research and development, manufacture and sale of our products can raise ethical issues, and we aim to be open about how we tackle them.
We understand how important it is to communicate with our stakeholders, seeking to understand their views, and being transparent about any setbacks we have experienced as well as the progress we have made.
Letter to Shareholders continued We are building on our strong ethical culture in which all our decisions are guided by our values: Commit to transparency Show respect for people Always demonstrate the highest integrity in our conduct Be patient focused In 2010 we have taken further steps to make our company more responsive, more flexible and more open to societys expectations.
For example, we have continued to improve access to our medicines and vaccines for patients, irrespective of where they live and their ability to pay.
We believe this is the right thing to do and that it will contribute to sustainable business growth.
Improving the environmental sustainability of our business is also a priority and we have launched a new set of ambitious targets.
Our goal is to reduce the environmental impact of our value chain, from raw materials to product disposal, and to be carbon neutral by 2050.
Ultimately we believe that being a responsible business is good for society and good for GSK.
Finally, I would like to recognise the significant contribution of our employees and our many partners.
We remain confident that we can generate increased value for shareholders as well as deliver better outcomes to patients and consumers.
