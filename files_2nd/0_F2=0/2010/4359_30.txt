66 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental analysis IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Companys Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
Previously, segments were determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14, Segment Reporting.
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the segments results as it reects the segments underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation.
Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group and the reporting of this measure at the monthly business review meetings, which are organised according to the product types, has been used to identify and determine the Groups operating segments.
Trading profit is dened as profit on operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets, but includes the Group share of post-tax profit of joint ventures.
Following the adoption of IFRS 8, the Group has revised its operating and reporting segments.
The Groups operating segments are Cheese, UK Spreads, St Hubert, Liquid Products, Household, Share of Joint Ventures and Other.
Certain of these operating segments have been aggregated and the Group reports on five continuing segments within the business: Cheese, Spreads, Dairies, Share of Joint Ventures and Other.
The Cheese segment has not been aggregated with any other segment.
This business manufactures predominantly branded cheese in the UK and Ireland and sells mainly to retail customers.
The UK Spreads and St Hubert segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment being Spreads.
Both of these segments operate within the European Union and manufacture branded dairy spreads, using similar production methods.
Products are sold to similar end consumers in similar economic environments.
Distribution methods are similar and in both businesses customers are major retailers.
The Liquid Products and Household segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment being Dairies.
The Liquid Products and Household businesses both operate in the UK and predominantly sell fresh milk to a similar class of customer.
The milk processing sites, included in the Liquid Products segment, pack milk for both businesses.
Share of Joint Ventures forms a separate segment whose results are reviewed on a post-tax basis consistent with IFRS.
The results of this segment are now insignicant following the groups disposal of its 49% share of Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited in March 2009.
Further description is provided in Notes 14 and 15.
The Other segment comprises revenue earned from distributing product for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to the operating segments.
Generally, all central costs less external Other revenue are recharged back into operating segments such that their result reects the total cost base of the Group.
Other operating profit therefore is nil.
Comparative information has been restated to reect these new reportable segments.
Previously the Group reported two segments under IAS 14.
These comprised Foods and Dairies.
The Dairies segment was equivalent to the Dairies segment under IFRS 8.
The Foods segment incorporated Cheese, Spreads and Joint Ventures as reported under IFRS 8 and for revenue also incorporated Other revenue from third party distribution.

Group treasury is centrally managed and external interest income and expense is all incurred in the UK and is not allocated to segments.
Where interest is reviewed by the CODM it is done so on a net basis.
Further analysis of the interest expense for the Group is provided in Note 5.
Tax costs are not included in the measure of segment profit reviewed by the CODM.
Group tax is centrally managed and the group effective tax rate, not individual segment tax rates, is reported.
Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, receivables, assets in disposal group held for sale and investment on joint ventures and exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets and deferred tax assets as these items are managed on a Group basis.
Other segment assets comprise certain property, plant and equipment that is not reported in the segments.
Total segment liabilities have not been presented as this measure is not regularly reviewed by or provided to the CODM.
Inter-segment revenue comprises the sale of nished Cheese and Spreads products into the Dairies segment on a cost plus basis and is included in the segment result.
Other inter-segment transactions principally comprise sales of cream from the Dairies segment to the Spreads segment for the manufacture of butters.
Cream sold into Spreads is priced by reference to external commodity markets and is adjusted regularly so as to reect the costs that the Spreads segment would incur if it were a stand alone entity.
Revenue from inter-segment cream sales is not reported as revenue to the CODM but as a reduction to the Dairies segments input costs.
Segment depreciation and amortisation excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 9.2 million 2009: 9.6 million as these costs are not charged in the segment result.
Segment additions to non-current assets comprise additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment through capital expenditure and acquisition of businesses.

No individual customer contributes more than 10% of Group revenue 2009: nil.
The business segmentation above is based upon similar product groupings, namely cheese, spreads and liquid products and therefore any analysis of Group revenue by products and services is consistent with the revenue analysis presented above with the exception of non-milk product sales in the Dairies segment through the Household division, which amounted to 37.1 million 2009: 42.0 million.

This rationalisation includes the closure of certain depots the profit on which is shown above and rationalisation of the ongoing household operations.
These activities represent a fundamental part of the ongoing ordinary activities of the household operations.

At 31 March 2010, 2.5 million was provided against inventory carrying value due to uncertainty regarding contracted realisations.
During 2009 10 this cheese inventory was sold at those contracted realisations and the associated provision was released.

There was significant capital investment during 2008 09 and between January 2009 and July 2009, volume was transferred into the new facility from First Milks facility at Maelor.
During the ramp up period, cheese was being cut and packed at both Nuneaton and Maelor with resulting duplicate costs as both sites were operating at below normal capacity.
These duplicate running costs ceased in the first half of the year as substantially all cutting and packing was transferred successfully to Nuneaton.
The duplicate costs incurred in the period amounted to 1.5 million.
In April 2010, the OFT announced that parties to the 2007 Statement of Objections will get a penalty reduction provided each company continues to co-operate with the OFT.
The OFT expects to conclude and issue its decision by early summer 2010.
Accordingly, the settlement provision has been reduced to reect our best estimate of the penalty ultimately payable 7.1 million plus legal fees expected to be incurred 0.2 million resulting in a release of 2.2 million in the year ended 31 March 2010 see Note 24.
In November 2009, the UK dened benefit pension plan was closed to future service accrual beyond 31 March 2010.
This cessation of future service accrual resulted in an exceptional curtailment gain of 16.9 million in the year ended 31 March 2010 see Note 21.
Additionally, legal and professional fees of 0.6 million were incurred in order to effect this change.
During 2008 09, we closed our Nottingham dairy processing plant and reduced the carrying value of the land and buildings to 1.5 million, being managements best view at that time of fair value less costs to sell.
In August 2009, the site was sold to a third party for proceeds of 2.5 million resulting in an exceptional gain on disposal of 1.0 million.
The Group is in discussions with Wexford Milk Producers WMP to sell 50% of the shares in Wexford Creamery Limited WCL which, if successful, would decrease the Groups shareholding from 80% to 30%.
The assets and liabilities of WCL have been disclosed as a disposal group held for sale at 31 March 2010.
On classication as a disposal group held for sale, an impairment of 16.0 million was charged to reduce the carrying value of assets to fair value less costs to sell.
Further details are provided in Note 8.
On 26 March 2009, the Group disposed of its 49% share in Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited YDC for cash consideration of 63.5 million see below.
As part of the disposal of YDC, future service accruals immediately ceased in the YDC dened benefit scheme and the Group contracted to extinguish any remaining funding liability by purchasing an insurance buy-out.
On 26 March 2009, 3.5 million was charged as a provision for the cost of the insurance and funds were deposited in escrow for the benefit of the YDC scheme trustee.
This amount was the best estimate at that time of the cost of buying out the scheme liabilities.
The final cost of the buy-out was 1.2 million, 2.3 million less than was estimated.
In the period to 31 March 2010, the Group received funds of 2.3 million from the escrow account reecting the reduced cost of insurance.
This credit has been classied as exceptional in a manner consistent with the original gain on disposal in 2008 09.
Additionally, the Group incurred costs in relation to the disposal of this business in excess of amounts accrued at 31 March 2009.
These additional costs, totalling 0.3 million, have been classied as exceptional.
Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2009 comprised: 9.2 million charge in relation to a large restructuring within Dairies.
The closure of the Nottingham dairy processing plant and associated distribution network restructuring costs amounted to 7.2 million.
Additionally, an impairment was charged against the carrying value of the previously closed Totnes site.
This and associated costs amounted to a 2.0 million exceptional charge.
1.0 million charge in relation to an onerous long-term milk supply contract.
This contract was renegotiated in the first half of 2009 10 and the new supply agreement is not onerous.
3.7 million charge in respect of duplicate running costs at the newly commissioned cheese cutting and packing facility at Nuneaton.
During the ramp up period, cheese was cut and packed both at Nuneaton and by First Milk under a transitional agreement.
This resulted in inefficiencies during the dual running period.
4.5 million loss on the disposal of the property, plant and equipment and the inventories of the Groups Stilton and speciality cheese business based in Hartington, Derbyshire to Long Clawson Dairy Limited.
The loss on disposal comprised: m Sales proceeds cash consideration 3.8 Book value of property, plant and equipment disposed 4.4 Book value of intangible assets disposed 0.4 Book value of inventories disposed 3.3 Other fees and costs 0.7 Loss on disposal 5.0 Associated pension curtailment gain 0.5 Exceptional charge before tax 4.5 The numbers 72 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 4 Exceptional items continued 5.6 million impairment charge against the carrying value of plant and equipment at the Groups cheese manufacturing plant in Wexford, Ireland.
These assets were written down to their fair value less costs to sell based on managements best view as to their current market value at that time.
50.4 million gain on sale of 49% share in YDC sold on 26 March 2009.
The profit on disposal as reported at 31 March 2009 was as follows: m Sales proceeds cash consideration 63.5 Group share of YDC net assets at date of disposal 8.6 Provision for cost of insuring YDC dened benefit pension scheme liabilities 3.5 Other estimated fees and costs 1.0 Gain on disposal reported in 2008 09 50.4 14.3 million exceptional tax charge relating to the cessation of Industrial Buildings Allowances which was enacted in the first half of 2008 09.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits other than in the trades in which they arose and the future profitability of these trades is uncertain.
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of 71.6 million 2009: 71.3 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable gains.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of them being utilised.
The Group has realised capital gains amounting to 43.0 million 2009: 36.9 million for which rollover relief claims have or are intended to be made.
At 31 March 2010, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2009: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries in Ireland as the dividends would be exempt from UK corporation tax if they were remitted to the UK parent company.

This transaction would reduce the Groups shareholding from 80% to 30% and increase WMPs shareholding from 20% to 70%.
The proposed transaction reduces further the Groups exposure to commodity cheese and allows the Group to concentrate on its key brands.
Cash proceeds are expected to be approximately 9 million and the transaction is expected to complete in the first half of 2010 11.
The assets and liabilities of WCL comprise a disposal group held for sale and have been separately identied as such at 31 March 2010.
The disposal group is analysed as follows: Assets in disposal group held for sale m Deferred tax asset 0.3 Investment in joint ventures 0.6 Inventories 4.6 Trade and other receivables 5.8 Cash and short-term deposits 7.5 18.8 Liabilities associated with disposal group held for sale m Trade and other payables 4.7 Retirement benefit obligations 2.0 Deferred income 0.6 Current tax liability 0.3 7.6 At 31 March 2009, an impairment of 5.6 million was recorded against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment of WCL based upon managements best estimate of fair value less costs to sell at that time.
No further impairment was recorded in the period up to WCL becoming a disposal group held for sale.
On recognition of the disposal group held for sale, an impairment of 16.0 million was recognised against the previous carrying value of WCLs net assets.
This write-down was necessary to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to the estimated fair value less costs to sell of the business calculated by reference to the proposed consideration of 9 million for 50% of the business adjusted for other costs, and fair value implications of the proposed divestment including options relating to the remaining 30% holding and proposed commercial agreements post completion.
In the first instance, 2.6 million was allocated to property, plant and equipment to write down the carrying value to nil.
The remaining 13.4 million impairment has been allocated against inventories as there are no other scoped-in non-current assets against which to allocate the remaining impairment and inventories comprise the largest value current asset available for allocation.
On final disposal in 2010 11, certain items previously taken to other comprehensive income in relation to the hedging of WCLs net assets, will be recycled to the income statement.
Inventories comprise principally maturing cheese stocks.
The retirement benefit obligation relates to the Wexford dened benefit pension scheme.
The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2010 was 10.2 million and the dened benefit obligation was 12.2 million resulting in a net scheme deficit of 2.0 million.
Prior year numbers are disclosed in Note 21.
WCL is reported within the Cheese segment.
The numbers 76 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS on profit for the year is calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Basic EPS is calculated on the basis of Group profit for the year less profit attributable to minority interests divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the directors opinion reects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share have been calculated.

The Speciality Cheese CGU was disposed of in August 2008 see Note 30.
All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash ow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 8.5% for UK Spreads and Cheese 2009: 9.5%, 8.9% for St Hubert 2009: 9.9%, 8.5% for Liquid Products and 9.2% for Household 2009: 9.8% for Dairies incorporating Liquid Products and Household.
Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specic risk factors.
Discount rates have decreased slightly compared to March 2009 reecting lower equity risk premiums.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the three-year period for UK Spreads, St Hubert, Liquid Products and Cheese is 2.0% pa being the estimated UK and Euro zone long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the three-year period for the Household CGU is 0%.
Management considers this a prudent assumption in the light of current milk&more opportunities in the Household business which is forecast to offset the historical doorstep decline rates beyond year 3.
The numbers 80 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Goodwill continued The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2010 is: Liquid Products 30.9 million 2009: 29.2 million Household 39.7 million 2009: 39.7 million UK Spreads 65.5 million 2009: 65.5 million St Hubert 198.6 million 2009: 206.2 million Cheese 2.1 million 2009: 2.1 million The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations: Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates reect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital WACC for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
This is based on forward prices in the marketplace adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three-year time frame.
For the Household business, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward offset by growth assumptions for milk&more.
The directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
In addition, the value in use calculation for the Group comprising each CGUs value in use is compared to the Group market capitalisation at the date of impairment testing and 31 March each year.
2010 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Spreads, St Hubert, Liquid Products and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount with the exception, in the cases of St Hubert and Liquid Products, of the discount rate used in the value in use calculation which is outside managements control.
Should the discount rate used for calculating the St Hubert value in use rise to 11.5% and the discount rate used for calculating the Liquid Products value in use rise to 10.4% due to external financial market uncertainties then the carrying value would exceed that units recoverable amount.
The impairment headroom for the St Hubert and Liquids CGUs is 105 million and 39 million respectively.
For the Household CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are cautious.
The key assumption is future growth rates.
Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should any decline in the Household CGU continue and be greater than 12% per annum beyond year three then the value in use for this CGU could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
The impairment headroom for the Household CGU is 94 million.

On 17 July 2008, all amounts outstanding under the 2004 five-year facility were repaid and the facility cancelled.
The new facility has identical financial covenants as both the 2006 five-year facility, the loan notes and the 2004 five-year facility that it replaced.
The maximum net debt EBITDA ratio under all facilities is 3.5 times.
Details of the Groups interest rate management strategy and interest rate swaps are included in Notes 31 and 32.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times, and minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2010 2009: none.
At 31 March 2010 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.4 times 2009: 2.9 times.
21 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two dened benefit pension plans, Dairy Crest in the UK and Wexford in Ireland, both of which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The Dairy Crest Group pension fund is a final salary scheme that was closed to new employees joining after 30 June 2006.
Employees joining after this date are invited to join a Dairy Crest Group dened contribution plan.
During the year ended 31 March 2010, the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was closed to future service accrual with an effective date of 1 April 2010.
Members of the scheme have been invited to make contributions into the dened contribution plan in future.
During the year ended 31 March 2010, Wexford Creamery Limited became a disposal group held for sale.
As a result the Wexford pension scheme is no longer included in the analysis below at 31 March 2010.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007 by the funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially and the March 2010 valuation will be completed in the year ended 31 March 2011.
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the dened benefit plans.

Furthermore, additional contributions of 12 million per annum were agreed for the two years to March 2009.
Further additional contributions of 20 million per annum have been agreed from October 2009 10 million in the year ended 31 March 2010.
These arrangements will be reviewed with the Trustee after the March 2010 full actuarial valuation is completed.
In December 2008, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of an insurance contract.
A further insurance contract for retired members was purchased in June 2009 resulting in coverage for all members who retired up to August 2008.
These contracts are included within scheme assets and their value will always be equal to the obligation as calculated under IAS 19 for those members covered.
This will reduce the volatility of the reported dened benefit obligations in future periods.
The purchase of the second insurance contract in June 2009 was funded by the sale of equities.
Subsequently, in order to re-establish an appropriate equity weighting of scheme assets, the Fund purchased equity total return swaps synthetic equity.
These instruments comprise an asset leg and a liability leg.
The asset leg generates a return based on UK and overseas equity indices and the liability leg incurs a cost based on LIBOR plus margin.
At inception, the principal value of each leg was 200 million.
The positive valuation of synthetic equity at 31 March 2010 reects the underlying strength in equities subsequent to the swap purchase.
Credit risk is minimised since collateral is provided by the counterparties to the benefit of Dairy Crest Pension Scheme when the instruments are in the money.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates with the exception of the insured retirement obligations which equal the IAS 19 valuation of obligations which they cover.
The expected rate of return on equities of 7.8% March 2009: 8.3% reects historic UK equity returns with an assumption for 2010 that the strong equity market rally in 2009 10 will give rise to marginally lower market returns in the medium term versus what was assumed at 31 March 2009.
The equity return assumption represents a reasonable risk premium over gilts.
It is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size.
This return assumption is also applied to the equity leg on equity total return swaps.
The liability leg cost assumption is based upon medium term LIBOR yields.
The expected rate of return on bonds of 5.1% March 2009: 7.1% is based upon the gross redemption yields available on a similar prole of gilts and corporate bonds.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 89 21 Retirement benefit obligations continued The average duration of scheme liabilities is approximately 19 years.
Discount rate assumptions for each reporting period are based upon quoted AA-rated corporate bond indices, excluding collateralised bonds, with maturities matching the schemes expected benefit payments.
Ination assumptions are based upon the difference between long-term xed income and index linked gilt yields.
The scheme deficit is highly dependent upon these input assumptions which are set at the reporting period end dates.
A 0.1% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 16 million 2009: 12 million.
A 0.1% increase in the ination assumption would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 10 million 2009: 7 million.
An increase in life expectancy across all members of one year would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 24 million 2009: 13 million.
The net benefit expense for the year for the Wexford Creamery Limited, included in the table above, amounted to 0.5 million 2009: 0.5 million.
The fair value of plan assets, the obligation and the net scheme deficit are disclosed in Note 8.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS, and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of other recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income and expense in relation to the Group pension plans.

The amount of the ne provided was 9.4 million plus legal fees and reected the early resolution agreement that was reached with the OFT in December 2007.
Accordingly, the provision has been reduced to reect our best estimate of the penalty ultimately payable 7.1 million plus legal fees expected to be incurred 0.2 million.
This ne is dependent upon the Groups continued full co-operation with the OFT until the matter is settled.
Settlement is expected to be reached in the year ending 31 March 2011 and therefore the related provision has been classied as current.
Onerous contract The Group had one milk supply contract with a middle ground customer which, due to unprecedented increases in milk costs in 2007 08 and a subsequent weakening of cream prices, became onerous.
An exceptional provision of 4.4 million was charged in the year ended 31 March 2008, being the best estimate at the time of the present value of future cash outows resulting from the contractual obligations in the contract.
In the year ended 31 March 2009, there were further milk cost increases and contract negotiations took longer than anticipated.
This resulted in a 0.9 million additional provision being charged.
The onerous contract was exited in June 2009 by which point the remaining provision had been fully extinguished.
YDC pension liabilities As part of the disposal of YDC, future service accruals immediately ceased in the YDC dened benefit scheme and the Group contracted to extinguish any remaining funding liability by purchasing an insurance buy-out.
On completion of the disposal, 3.5 million was charged as a provision for the cost of the insurance and funds were deposited in escrow for the benefit of the YDC scheme trustee.
This amount was the best estimate at the date of disposal of the cost of buying out the scheme liabilities.
This was accounted for as a provision under IAS 37 and not under IAS 19 as there ceased to be a dened benefit scheme on completion of the disposal.
During the year ended 31 March 2010, the Group received 2.3 million back from escrow as the final cost of insuring future pension liabilities was lower than originally anticipated.
The refund from escrow was treated as an exceptional gain and further details are provided in Note 4.

The impact is to increase retained earnings at that date by 0.9 million and to reduce the translation reserve by 0.9 million.
There is no impact on total share capital and reserves, nor on minority interests at that date.
The classication of reserves at 31 March 2008 is not affected by this change.
The merger reserve includes the premium on shares issued to satisfy the purchase of Dairy Crest Limited in 1996.
The cumulative amount of goodwill charged against the merger reserve is 86.8 million 2009: 86.8 million.
The reserve is not distributable.
The hedging reserve records the movements on designated hedging items, offset by any movements recognised directly in equity on underlying hedging items.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 93 27 Share based payment plans Group The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder return TSR over a three-year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in earnings per share or, on the 2006 to 2008 awards, economic profit.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years.
On 29 June 2009 1,062,106 options were granted under the LTISP scheme July 2008: 1,161,635.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
On 26 June 2009 4,461,240 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave scheme at a grant price of 227 pence.
No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2009.
Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Options granted under the Dairy Crest ESOS to subscribe for the Companys shares could be exercised up to 2012 but all outstanding options were exercised in the year ended 31 March 2007.
No options have been granted under this scheme since 22 July 2002.
There were no cash settlement alternatives.
In addition, from 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares with a vesting period of three years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these shares are charged over four years being the year the bonus related to and the three-year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued and the share price at date of issue.
Deferred shares to the value of 0.6 million are to be issued in relation to the year ended 31 March 2010.
There were no deferred shares issued in relation to the year ended 31 March 2009.
The number of share options and weighted average exercise price for each of the schemes is set out as follows: LTISP Sharesave scheme Weighted average exercise price Number Number pence Options outstanding at 1 April 2009 1,754,221 976,789 487.0 Options granted during the year 1,062,106 4,461,240 227.0 Reinvested dividends 134,713 Options exercised during the year 311,373 Options forfeited during the year 568,285 956,404 436.1 Options outstanding at 31 March 2010 2,071,382 4,481,625 239.1 Exercisable at 31 March 2010 64,719 Options outstanding at 1 April 2008 1,566,117 2,450,009 441.4 Options granted during the year 1,161,635 Reinvested dividends 159,046 Options exercised during the year 450,419 9,231 388.0 Options forfeited during the year 682,158 1,463,989 411.3 Options outstanding at 31 March 2009 1,754,221 976,789 487.0 Exercisable at 31 March 2009 350,250 The weighted average exercise price for LTISP options is nil.

Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to March 2013 at prices ranging from 227 pence to 487 pence March 2009: exercisable up to September 2011 at a price of 487 pence.
LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to June 2019 March 2009: July 2018.
The remaining weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2010 is 8.68 years for the LTISP and 2.85 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2009: 8.52 years and 2.42 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of LTISP options was 3.55 2009: 3.88 and was not applicable on exercise of Sharesave options as none were exercised 2009: not applicable as none were exercised.
The numbers 94 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Share based payment plans continued The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in June 2009 is 30% giving a fair value of 0.68 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the June 2009 grant were: expected share price volatility 43%, risk free rate of interest 2.4% and dividend yield 6.5%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
There were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2009.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in June 2009 is 75% for the TSR element and 100% for the EPS element July 2008: 44% TSR and 100% Economic profit giving a fair value of 2.74 per option granted 2009: 2.37.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on EPS 2009: economic profit and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
There is no reasonable likelihood of the economic profit condition on the 2008 LTISP issue being met and no charge has been assumed for this element.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2010 were as follows: Term 3 years 2009: 3 years Volatility 47% 2009: 32% Risk free rate 2.1% 2009: 5.2% Average volatility of comparator TSR 50% 2009: 33% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 26% 2009: 11% The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.

31 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of uctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash ows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2010 and 2009, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
The numbers 98 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that forecast net borrowings, plus a reasonable operating headroom, are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 20.
At 31 March 2010 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 648.5 million 2009: 668.6 million excluding finance leases of 11.8 million 2009: 13.8 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on $US and loan notes of 20.5 million 2009: 32.1 million.
The facilities consist of: 2010 an 85 million plus 175 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in July 2013: a 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011: Loan notes totalling 307.4 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
2009 an 85 million plus 175 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in July 2013: a 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011: Loan notes totalling 321.5 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2010 amounted to 275.1 million 2009: 127.0 million.
This can be analysed as follows see also Note 20 : 2010 2010 2009 2009 Drawn down Facility Drawn down Facility m m m m November 2006 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 66.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 July 2008 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 241.1 120.1 247.1 Total 66.0 341.1 220.1 347.1 Headroom 275.1 127.0 Cash and short term deposits 20.0 107.5 Effective headroom 295.1 234.5 The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
The increased focus on cash generation over the two years ended 31 March 2010 have resulted in signicantly lower levels of borrowings and increased facility headroom.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a oating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of xed and variable rate debt.
Specically, to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at xed rates of interest in the medium term.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued xed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its oating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between xed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash ow obligations.
At 31 March 2010, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, 100% of the Groups borrowings were at a xed rate of interest 2009: 73%.
The proportion of xed interest borrowings is higher than our medium-term target, however the interest rate swaps will expire in 2011 12 and, depending on borrowing requirements at this time, the proportion of xed rate borrowings will be reduced in the future.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 32.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 99 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the UK and also buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash ows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposures by borrowing to some extent in the same functional currency as the foreign operation into which it invests.
The foreign operations hedged in this way are St Hubert SAS France and Wexford Creamery Limited Ireland : both are Euro-denominated subsidiaries.
Our policy changed during the year ended 31 March 2009.
Previously, 100% of overseas net assets were hedged but this proportion has been reduced in line with the Groups reduced levels of Euro-denominated borrowings.
Our revised policy is to hedge 100% of the inventories and tangible xed assets and 33% of goodwill and intangible assets exposure of these subsidiaries through borrowings and or cross-currency swaps in Euros.
No hedging of earnings exposure is undertaken.
At present, our only currency exposure is Euros.
At 31 March 2010 and 2009, all borrowings designated as a net investment hedge are done so on a pre-tax basis and no cross-currency swaps are utilised as part of the hedging relationship.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
This can be seen in Note 17 where the only significant non-Sterling debtors are in Euros and these predominantly relate to the functional currency of St Hubert and Wexford.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be xed.
There are currently no sales between the UK business and St Hubert SAS.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2006, the Group issued loan notes denominated in $US.
At the same time, cross-currency swaps were implemented to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash ows.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassication of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
In 2009, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps on 75 million of its loan notes denominated in Euros in order to hedge the future interest and principal repayment cash ows.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to this 75 million of debt as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassication of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil HFO and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
Vegetable oil contracts are usually structured such that between six and nine months purchases are at xed prices.
Energy is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
Diesel and HFO is not generally contracted at xed prices although from time to time, forward contracts have been put in place to x future prices.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Executive.
The numbers 100 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verication procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
The Household doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly where payment terms have been breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 175.3 million 2009: 279.6 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of AA or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
At 31 March 2010 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was between 2.0 and 2.5 times March 2009: between 2.5 and 3.0 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2010 or 2009 apart from the re-basing of dividends downwards by 25% starting with the full year dividend for 2008 09.
There have been no changes in the objectives, policies and procedures during the last two years.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The denition of net debt is included in Note 34.
The gearing ratio at March 2010 and 2009 can be analysed as follows: 2010 2009 m m Net debt 337.2 415.8 Shareholders funds 292.8 357.0 Gearing ratio 115% 116% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7.
The dividend policy is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 2.0 and 2.5 times.
The final dividend for 2008 09 was rebased 25% reduction in the light of additional cash contributions to the pension scheme and the dilutive effect of the Yoplait Dairy Crest disposal on earnings.
The 2009 10 interim dividend was similarly rebased and reduced by 25%.
The final proposed dividend for 2009 10 is 13.6 pence representing a 5% increase on last year 2009: 13.0 pence.
Total dividends paid and proposed in the year ended 31 March 2010 of 18.9 pence represent a decrease of 6% 2009: 20.1 pence, a decrease of 17.6%.

Interest on financial instruments classied as oating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classied as xed rate is xed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on oating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash ow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
At 31 March 2010, all Group borrowings were at xed rates of interest see Note 31.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative xed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative oating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash ow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative oating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative xed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure due to oating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.

These cross currency swaps have both legs at xed interest rates, are designated as cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2010 and 2009 the xed interest rates vary from 5.305% to 5.315%.
The gain deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement operating costs during the next three to six years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2010 was 75 million 67 million 2009: 75 million 67 million.
At 31 March 2010 and 2009 the xed interest rates vary from 4.955% to 5.180%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement operating costs during the next four to five years being the life of the swaps.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of i the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS, its subsidiary in France ii the net asset investment in Wexford Creamery Limited, its subsidiary in Ireland.
The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2010 was 133.0 million 2009: 138.0 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 6.0 million 2009: 36.8 million loss on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in reserves.
Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year and any gains or losses deferred will then reverse in the income statement operating costs.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2010 of 275.1 million 2009: 127.0 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These undrawn facilities expire in November 2011 34 million and July 2013 241.1 million.
In July 2008, the Group agreed a new five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility of 85 million and 175 million.
On 17 July 2008 all amounts outstanding under the 2004 facility were repaid and the facility cancelled.
The new facility has the same financial covenants as the 2004 and 2006 facilities and includes a maximum net debt EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.

The loan had a principal value of 236.0 million with a coupon of 0.1% per annum.
On 2 October 2008 the receivable under this loan was sold to a subsidiary undertaking for cash consideration of 228.9 million, being its fair value at that date as advised by external valuation professionals.
Up to its sale, the convertible loan had been designated as at fair value through profit and loss having satisfied the conditions in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
Since the loan was neither an equity investment nor currently convertible, it was within the scope of IAS 39.
In addition, the convertible loan contained a derivative, namely a call option to acquire an equity interest in Dairy Crest Limited which meets the requirements in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
The convertible loan was carried at fair value with any gains or losses taken to the income statement up to 2 October 2008.
The valuation at 2 October 2008 was 228.9 million resulting in a gain in the year ended 31 March 2009 of 1.2 million.
The convertible loan is not traded in a publicly quoted market therefore a Black Scholes Option Pricing model was used in order to value the equity portion of the loan at the date of sale.
The input assumptions used were as follows: dividend yield 2.6%: volatility 29%: risk free rate 3.6%: and time to expiry six months.
