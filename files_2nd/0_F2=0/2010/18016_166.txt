For awards made in 2010, awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: a the Companys total return TR over three consecutive financial years the TR Performance Period relative to the median of the TRs over the equivalent period of Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, Capital & Counties Properties PLC, Land Securities Group plc, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc the Comparator Group : and b the Companys total shareholder return TSR over a period of three years the TSR Performance Period relative to the median of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group.
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance period.
In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT including Capital & Counties, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back.
For full vesting to be achieved, the target is median 2.5 per cent per annum.
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in ordinary shares.
For full vesting to be achieved, the target is median 4 per cent per annum.
For performance at median, 33 per cent of an award will vest.
For intermediate performance above median, vesting will be on a straight-line basis from 33 per cent to 100 per cent.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance gures are a genuine reection of underlying financial performance.
Where events occur which cause the Committee to consider that the performance conditions have become inappropriate or impractical, the Committee may amend, relax or waive such conditions as it deems appropriate, provided that the conditions after the changes are not materially tougher or easier to achieve than was intended at the outset.
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the comparator group a company which has ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, signicantly diminished.
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the comparator group whether to replace a removed member or otherwise if it believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the comparator group.
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
