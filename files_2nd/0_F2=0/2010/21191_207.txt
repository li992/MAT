Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers or by local qualified staff of the Group in overseas operations, all with recent relevant experience.
These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other countries.
This assessment, on the basis of Existing Use Value and in accordance with UK Practice Statement 1.3, is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding potential alternative uses.
The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 347 million 2009:328 million.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.
