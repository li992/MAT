AGM Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Companys AGM at which they can meet and question the directors.
The Company will make a presentation at the AGM to highlight the key business developments and events during the year.
The full Board is expected to be available at the AGM to answer shareholders questions.
Voting at the AGM will be on a show of hands but the proxy votes cast on each resolution will be displayed after each resolution has been voted on.
If the voting on a show of hands produces a different result from that which would have been achieved on a poll, the Chairman will call a poll so that the result of the voting on that resolution reflects the wishes of the majority of shareholders.
The proxy votes cast at each AGM are disclosed on our website.
