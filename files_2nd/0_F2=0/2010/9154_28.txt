Employee bene ts i Pensions The Company operates fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution pension schemes for its employees.
A fide ned bene t scheme is a pension scheme that fide fines an amount of pension bene t that an employee will receive on retirement.
A fide ned contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Company usually pays xed contributions into a separate entity.
In all cases a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing liabilities.
The assets of each of these funds are either held under trusts or managed by insurance companies and are held entirely separate from the Companys assets.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of fide ned bene t pension schemes is the fair value of scheme assets less the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation at the balance sheet date, together with an adjustment for any past service costs not yet recognised.
The fide ned bene t obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the fide ned bene t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out ows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the bene ts will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited directly to the pro t and loss reserve as they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the pro t and loss account, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a speci ed period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
For fide ned contribution schemes, the Company pays contributions to privately administered pension schemes on a contractual basis.
The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee bene t expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
ii Share-based compensation The Company operates several equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options or deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes and stochastic models.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or deferred shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
The value of the charge is adjusted to re ect expected and actual levels of options vesting due to non-market vesting conditions.
iii Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP The ESOP is a separately administered discretionary trust.
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
Own shares held by the ESOP are deducted from equity shareholders funds and the shares are held at historical cost until they are sold.
The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP are included in both the Companys and the consolidated financial statements.
f. Deferred tax Provision is made for deferred tax using the incremental provision approach and is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date subject to the following: Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date.
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not recognised.
Deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only where dividends are accrued as receivable or there is an intention to remit these in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences.
g. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
indd 98 13 4 10 13 4 10 02:23:22 02:23:22 King sher plc Annual Report and Accounts 99 2009 10 h. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the financial asset expire or the Company has substantially transferred the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities or a part of a financial liability are derecognised when the obligation speci ed in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
i Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Where borrowings are in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made to their carrying amounts to re ect the hedged risks.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the pro t and loss account using the effective interest method.
ii Trade creditors Trade creditors are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
iii Derivatives and hedge accounting Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to which it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the pro t and loss account as they arise.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently carried at fair value.
The accounting treatment of derivatives classi ed as hedges depends on their designation, which occurs at the start of the hedge relationship.
The Company designates certain derivatives as a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability fair value hedge.
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry being recorded in the pro t and loss account.
Gains or losses from remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are also recognised in the pro t and loss account.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company documents in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Company also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer quali es for hedge accounting.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the pro t and loss account.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the fide ned bene t pension schemes are set by the directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries.
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to signi cant movements in the estimated obligation.
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets re ects market expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns and the mix of assets in the scheme.

The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PA 92 tables projected forward to 2007 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the standard improvements, subject to a minimum of 0.5% pa.
These improvements have been set with regard to trends observed within the scheme over the past decade.
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows: Years 2009 10 2008 09 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 87.2 87.2 Female 85.9 85.9 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 88.8 88.8 Female 87.1 87.1 KF7225 AR 09 10 KF7225 AR 09 10 Back.

Restricted Special Awards were originally reported under the KISS.
These awards are granted as one-off compensatory awards granted under the rules of the KISS.
They are nil cost options, as with the KISS, but do not accrue dividends until after they are exercised.
Vesting dates may vary according to the individual grants.
Certain employees, excluding directors, have been granted contingent share awards under the King sher Retention Plan.
The Store Manager Incentive Plan provided provisional awards to store managers in 2009 that will vest in April 2011 and April 2012.
There are performance conditions based on store standards and an award will lapse if these are not maintained throughout the three year performance period.
These awards do not accrue dividends during the vesting period.
Under the UK ShareSave scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into Inland Revenue approved savings contracts for a period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option price is the average market price over three days shortly before an offer to subscribe, discounted by 20%.
Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or five year period.
The International ShareSave scheme, which operates along the lines of the UK ShareSave scheme, includes eligible employees in certain overseas locations.
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option schemes was made in April 2003.
Under these schemes, participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group.
These options are normally exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant up to the tenth anniversary, except where the performance condition has not been met, in which case this date is deferred accordingly.
The performance conditions for all options have now been met, except for the grant made in April 2003.
On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, participants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of shares in the Company.
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
Under FRS 20, Share-based Payment, the Company recognises a charge for share options granted after 7 November 2002.
The Company has not repeated the disclosures required by FRS 20 as these are already included in note 30 of the King sher plc consolidated financial statements.
