THE GROUP COMPANY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11.3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of any investments in fixed interest securities the fair value of the debenture loan the level of income receivable from cash at bank and on deposit the level of interest expense on any variable rate bank loans the prices of the underlying securities held in the portfolios Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
Property companies usually have borrowings themselves and the level of gearing and structure of its debt portfolio is a key factor when assessing the investment in a property company.
The Group has fixed and variable rate borrowings.
The interest rate on the debenture loan is fixed, details are set out in note 14.
In addition to the debentures the Group has an unsecured, multi-currency revolving loan facility which carries a variable rate of interest based on the currency drawn, plus a margin.
The Manager considers both the level of debt on the balance sheet of the Group i. e. the debenture and any bank loans drawn and the see-through gearing, taking into account the assets and liabilities of the underlying investments, when considering the investment portfolio.
These gearing levels are reported regularly to the Board.
The majority of the Groups investment portfolio is non-interest bearing.
As a result the Groups financial assets are not directly subject to significant amounts of risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Interest rate risk exposure The exposure at 31 March of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 11,445,000 2009: 77,568,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets is 4,621,000 2009: 1,489,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 60,250,000 2009: 15,000,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2009: same Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facility is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent for the type of loan The finance charge on the debenture stocks was at a weighted average interest rate of 11.757% 2009: 9.891%.
The year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rates changes.
Interest rate sensitivity A change of 2% on interest rates at the reporting date would have had the following direct impact: 2010 2010 2009 2009 2% 2% 2% 2% Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 000 000 000 000 Change to shareholders funds 487 487 1,551 1,551 Change to total earnings loss : per Ordinary share 0.14 p 0.14p 0.48p 0.48 p per Sigma share 0.10 p 0.10p 0.25p 0.25 p This level of change is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes throughout the period.
This assessment does not take into account the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of the investments the Group holds.
