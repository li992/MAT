2010 review Directors and corporate governance Financial statements Other information 01 35 36 57 58 114 115 116 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies i Corporate information Charter International plc the Company, which is the ultimate parent company of the Charter Group, is incorporated and registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law as a public company limited by shares.
The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements for the Group were approved by the Board on 17 February 2011. ii Accounting policies The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the United Kingdom UK and in compliance with the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
Although Charter International plc is incorporated and registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law, the consolidated financial statements include disclosures sufficient to comply with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value.
In compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the financial statements of Charter International plc are included within the Group Annual Report.
These are presented in sterling as that is the functional currency of that company.
The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements under UK accounting standards.
Use of adjusted measures In order to help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance the following adjusted measures have been presented.
Adjusted operating profit is after excluding acquisition costs, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill and exceptional items from operating profit.
Items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after excluding acquisition costs, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans and non-cash net nancing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations, including attributable tax and minority interests, from basic earnings per share.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated, in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
On an ongoing basis, estimates are evaluated using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS.
Actual results may differ signicantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
Should circumstances change, such that different assumptions, estimates and judgements are considered to be more appropriate, this may give rise to material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year particularly in respect of the key estimates, judgements and assumptions outlined below.
Construction contracts Revenue and profit on construction contracts are usually recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract calculated by reference to estimates of contract revenue and expected costs including provisions for warranty and product liability.
At 31 December 2010, amounts receivable payable under construction contracts were 42.5 million 2009: 41.9 million and 57.7 million 2009: 45.5 million respectively.
Contract retentions held by customers at 31 December 2010 in respect of construction contracts amounted to 28.1 million 2009: 32.4 million.
Warranty and product liability provisions at 31 December 2010 of 28.5 million 2009: 30.5 million mainly relate to construction contracts.
Employee benets Provisions for dened benefit post-employment obligations are calculated by independent actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions and estimates used are based on independent actuarial advice and include the discount rate and estimates of life expectancy.
Other key assumptions for dened benefit post-employment obligations are based in part on market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Further information is disclosed in note 20.
At 31 December 2010, the net retirement benefit obligation was 138.7 million 2009: 162.2 million.
Goodwill impairment testing Capitalised goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Should the carrying value of the goodwill exceed its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised.
The recoverable amounts are calculated based on the estimated value in use of cash-generating units.
These calculations require estimates of cash ows, growth rates and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specic risks associated with particular cash-generating units.
Further information regarding these assumptions is set out in note 10.
At 31 December 2010, the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill was 99.6 million 2009: 92.7 million.
Charter International plc 65 Annual Report 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Provisions Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement.
These include provisions for legal and environmental claims.
Calculations of these provisions are based on cash ows relating to these costs estimated by management supported by the use of external consultants, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material.
At 31 December 2010, these provisions amounted to 21.9 million 2009: 30.6 million.
Tax estimates The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect.
The determination of appropriate provisions for current and deferred income taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Groups ability to utilise tax benets through future earnings, based on approved budgets and forecasts, and tax planning.
These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events.
At 31 December 2010, net income tax liabilities provided were 15.6 million 2009: 23.4 million and net deferred income tax assets recognised amounted to 57.8 million 2009: 58.8 million.
Changes to accounting policies Revised standards mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 adopted by the Group: IFRS 3 revised Business combinations.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent consideration measured at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisitionrelated costs are required to be expensed.
The Group has applied IFRS 3 revised prospectively to transactions from 1 January 2010.
Acquisition costs of 0.2 million that would have previously been included as part of the consideration have been expensed in the period in accordance with the revised standard.
IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements.
The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling termed minority under the previous standard interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also species the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group has applied IAS 27 revised prospectively to transactions with non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010.
There has been no impact of IAS27 revised on the current period.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 and not early adopted.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments IAS 24 revised Related party disclosures Amendment to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a dened benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction These changes are currently being assessed but are unlikely to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
iii Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity.
A shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fideconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
On an  basis, the Group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
The excess of the cost of acquisition, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets acquired, including all separately identiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill and capitalised as an intangible asset see ix a Goodwill below.
As noted above with effect from 1 January 2010 acquisition-related costs are expensed.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Charter International plc 66 Annual Report 2010 2010 review Directors and corporate governance Financial statements Other information 01 35 36 57 58 114 115 116 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued b Transactions and non-controlling interests The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
When the Group ceases to have control or significant inuence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassied to profit or loss.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant inuence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassied to profit or loss where appropriate.
c Associates and joint ventures Associates and joint ventures are entities over which the Group has significant inuence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups share of its associates and joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates and joint ventures.
iv Segmental reporting Segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal purposes by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Revenue by geographic segment is allocated based on the country in which the customer is located.
Non-current assets and capital expenditure by geographic segment are allocated based on where the assets are located.
v Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter International plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash ow hedges.
The results and net assets of all Group companies that have non-sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows: a assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date: b income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period: and c all resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
vi Financial assets The classication of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classication of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates its designation at each reporting date.
Assets are classied as: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity investments: available-for-sale financial assets: or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement.
Available-for-sale financial assets include non-derivatives not classied in any of the other categories.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classication.
On initial recognition loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value.
Charter International plc 67 Annual Report 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued vi Financial assets continued Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit and loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classied as available for sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classied as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash ows from the assets has expired or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets classied as loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents.
They are classied as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
vii Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, that are used as hedges in the nancing and financial risk management of the Group are categorised as hedges.
Derivative financial instruments categorised as hedges are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
When derivatives are designated as hedging instruments these are classied as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash ow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
For cash ow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement generally as part of nancing.
When hedged cash ows result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash ow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash ows affect the income statement.
For net investment hedges gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The designation of hedging instruments, and their relationship to hedged items, is documented as appropriate at the time of designation.
Assessments of whether designated hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows of hedged items are documented at designation and periodically thereafter.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of other derivative financial instruments, including fair value hedges, are recognised in the income statement.
viii Property, plant and equipment The Groups policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004.
These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment that first commenced after 1 January 2009 are capitalised see xvi Borrowings below.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method spreading the difference between cost and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 30-50 years Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years Vehicles 5 years IT equipment 3-5 years Asset lives and residual values are re-assessed at least annually.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount see x Impairment of assets below.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
Charter International plc 68 Annual Report 2010 2010 review Directors and corporate governance Financial statements Other information 01 35 36 57 58 114 115 116 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued ix Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets of the subsidiary or associate acquired.
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Groups previous accounting policy together with additional amounts arising since that date, is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates and joint ventures in relation to associates and joint ventures.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classication and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years, or included as part of the carrying value of associates and joint ventures.
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
b Research and development Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible assets, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between 3 and 10 years.
c Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the licence, usually between 3 and 7 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, except for such costs that are directly associated with the production of identiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate benets exceeding costs beyond 1 year which are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than 7 years.
d Intangibles arising on acquisitions In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how.
All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives, usually between 3 and 10 years.
x Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
xi Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO basis or the average cost basis.
Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
xii Assets held for sale Assets are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classication.
Assets classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from the date of classication.
Charter International plc 69 Annual Report 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued xiii Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Amounts due after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classied in the balance sheet as non-current.
xiv Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts For the purposes of the cash ow statement, cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
xv Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
xvi Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the foreign exchange gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to expenditure that first commenced after 1 January 2009 on a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale is included in the cost of that asset.
Capitalisation ceases when the qualifying asset is substantially complete.
Borrowing costs in relation to inventories and construction contracts that are manufactured in large quantities on a repetitive basis are not capitalised.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
xvii Taxation Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred income taxation.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, including actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations see xviii Employee benets below and share-based payments see xix Share-based payments below, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
xviii Employee benets The Group accounts for pensions and similar post-retirement benets principally healthcare under IAS 19 Employee benets.
In respect of dened benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is dened by the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the dened obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised past service costs.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur directly in equity, in the statement of comprehensive income.
Taxation attributable to actuarial gains and losses is taken to equity.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
For dened benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments.
Interest on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is included within nancing in the income statement.
For dened contribution plans, where the Group pays a xed contribution into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether Charter International plc 70 Annual Report 2010 2010 review Directors and corporate governance Financial statements Other information 01 35 36 57 58 114 115 116 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued xviii Employee benets continued or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees the benets relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other dened benefit post-employment obligations, principally post-employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting methodology to that for dened benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can benefit in future, for example by refunds or a reduction in contributions.
Movements in the amount of any irrecoverable surplus are recognised directly in equity, in the statement of comprehensive income.
xix Share-based payments The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
Taxation attributable to the excess of the fair value over the charge to the income statement is taken to equity.
The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash-settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date, with changes recognised in the income statement.
For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
xx Government grants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specic assets they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
xxi Provisions for other liabilities Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised.
Incurred but not reported IBNR amounts are included in provisions.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash ows at a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
xxii Share capital Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Share issue costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid is deducted from Group equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
xxiii Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed during the year in respect of construction contracts.
Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intra-group sales, is recognised as follows: a Sales of goods and services The majority of the Groups revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a Group entity has fullled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration.
In respect of the sale of goods this is usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
b Construction contracts Revenue is recognised by a Group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer.
The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable.
Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
Charter International plc 71 Annual Report 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued xxiv Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benets and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
xxv Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the accounts in the period when paid.
2 Segment analysis The Group is organised into two principal businesses: ESAB welding, cutting and automation and Howden air and gas handling.
For the purposes of IFRS 8 Operating segments, ESAB is split into two segments: i welding: and ii cutting and automation.
Inter-segmental revenue is not significant.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 0.4 million 2009: 0.7 million dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the potentially issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated after certain adjustments to basic earnings per share so as to help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance as set out in the table below.
It should be noted that the term adjusted is not dened under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or be superior to, IFRS measures of profit.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-inuse calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts.
Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash ows for the following years based on estimated growth rates detailed in the table below.
These do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash ows are detailed in the table below.
Development costs are amortised once the asset is brought into use.
The Group tests development costs for assets not yet brought into use at least annually for impairment.

ii The Group tests for impairment of property, plant and equipment when there are indications that such assets might be impaired.
In view of the trading performance, start-up costs and challenging economic environment in China, the Directors have conducted an impairment review in respect of the property, plant and equipment of ESAB China and, as a result, continue to believe that the fair value of these tangible assets is in excess of carrying value.
When determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment, independent third party advice was obtained.
Where no such evidence existed, a value-in-use calculation was performed.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales values and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts from the most recent budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash ows for the following years based on estimated growth rates.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
In respect of ESAB China, the forecast cash ows cover a period of ten years being the remaining estimated useful life of the property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2010, have been based on growth rates of 8 per cent 2009: 10 per cent per annum and have been discounted at a rate of 11 per cent 2009: 11 per cent per annum.
iii Assets in the course of construction as at 31 December 2010 were 19.1 million 2009: 20.2 million.
11 b Assets held for sale As at 31 December 2010 a property within the welding, cutting and automation business with a carrying value of 6.1 million was reclassied from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale.
The estimated net sale proceeds are in excess of the carrying value.

At 31 December 2010 an asset for tax losses of 9.2 million 2009: 7.0 million was recognised in relation to businesses that generated taxable losses in either the current or preceding year.
These losses are expected to be recovered from taxable profits arising from improved trading and new contractual arrangements that were entered into in November 2009.
The majority of the tax losses recognised as at 31 December 2010 and 2009 are expected to be recovered within five years.

The Group also provides post-employment medical benets in the United States.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas dened benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States postemployment medical benets are assessed by professionally qualied independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2010 2009 UK Overseas UK Overseas %%%% Discount rate 5.40 5.25 5.70 5.60 Ination rate 3.60 2.70 3.60 2.80 Expected return on plan assets equities 7.75 9.10 8.00 9.10 bonds 4.60 5.20 4.90 5.30 property 7.25 7.50 other 3.70 5.20 4.25 5.60 total 6.00 7.10 6.20 7.20 Future salary increases 4.60 5.00 4.60 4.00 Future pension increases 3.55 2.30 3.55 2.30 Medical costs ination ultimate rate 4.50 5.00 The UK government announced in July 2010 that it will in future use the Consumer Price Index rather than the Retail Prices Index for the purposes of determining statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes.
Most of the Groups UK dened benefit pension scheme rules specify that pensions in deferment and certain guaranteed minimum pensions in payment will increase in accordance with the annual statutory orders published by the UK government.
The scheme rules also specify that the majority of increases to pensions in payment are linked to the Retail Prices Index and are therefore unaffected by the change.
The Trustees of these schemes have not yet notied the affected members of this change.
Accordingly the ination assumption used to determine the pension liability as at 31 December 2010 has been based on the Retail Prices Index.
It is estimated that had the ination assumption been based on the Consumer Prices Index, where applicable, scheme liabilities would have been reduced by approximately 8 million as at 31 December 2010.
The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on either the PA92, PA00 or SN1A standard mortality tables after retirement with allowance for future mortality improvements or on scheme-specic factors.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 29 years 2009: 27 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31 years 2009: 30 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 27 years 2009: 26 years if they are male and for a further 29 years 2009: 29 years if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States.
The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived from the RP-2000 table with allowance for future mortality improvements.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 25 years 2009: 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26 years 2009: 26 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 23 years 2009: 23 years if they are male and for a further 25 years 2009: 25 years if they are female.
Mortality assumptions for schemes in Sweden and Germany have been derived from the FFFS 2007 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term results for the various asset classes.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience.
The estimated impact on the liability for dened benefit pensions and post-employment medical benets as at 31 December 2010 resulting from changes to key assumptions is set out below: Estimated increase in liability 2010 2009 m m Discount rate 0.25 per cent decrease 24 23 Mortality one year increase in life expectancy after retirement 22 19 A 1 per cent increase in the ination assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by 0.1 million 2009: 0.1 million and the liability by 0.8 million 2009: 1.9 million.
A 1 per cent decrease in the ination assumption on medical costs would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by 0.1 million 2009: 0.1 million and the liability by 0.8 million 2009: 1.8 million.

Charter International plc 96 Annual Report 2010 2010 review Directors and corporate governance Financial statements Other information 01 35 36 57 58 114 115 116 21 Financial instruments and risk management i Financial risk management The international prole of Charters operations exposes it to financial risks including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
The Board sets policies to address these risks and there is a specic treasury policy setting out guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments.
Charters central treasury department is responsible for ensuring there are appropriate funding arrangements to meet the ongoing requirements of the Group and for managing effectively liquid funds held in the Group.
Regular cash ow forecasts are prepared by subsidiaries and reviewed by management.
In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks and balance sheet foreign currency translation risks of the Group within guidelines agreed by the Board.
Foreign currency transaction risks are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines and controls dened in the treasury policy.
a Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations mainly from its own cash resources.
It is the Groups objective to minimise the cost of borrowings and maximise the value from cash resources, whilst retaining the exibility of funding opportunities.
If considered appropriate, the Group would use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest prole and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
b Currency risk The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in Europe and America, and recurring exposures to exchange rate uctuations in respect of foreign currency transactions.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate.
Subject to Board approval, balance sheet translation exposures may be mitigated through the use of currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives.
Foreign currency transaction exposures result from sales or purchases by subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts may be used to hedge the net cash ows resulting from these transactions to the extent these are certain or highly probable.
c Financial credit risk The principal credit risks relate to the failure of dealing counterparties for foreign currency transactions and financial institutions with whom surplus funds are deposited in the short term.
Charters central treasury department monitors regularly the credit status of such counterparties and financial institutions, as well as the location of surplus cash worldwide with credit limits being set and subject to regular review.
d Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain committed facilities to ensure that, together with cash ows generated from operations, there are sufficient funds for current operations and their future requirements.
At 31 December 2010, the Groups centrally held committed facilities totalled 170 million with maturity dates between 2011 and 2013.
Two of these facilities have since been renewed such that the total has increased to 185 million with maturity dates that range between 2011 and 2015.
One facility for 25 million is due to expire in 2011.
The remaining facilities of 160 million have maturity dates that range between 2012 and 2015.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial and other covenants, the financial strength of the Charter Group means that the covenants attaching to these facilities have not been breached and are not expected to prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required in the future.
Charters central treasury department is responsible for monitoring current and future requirements.
It reviews annual strategy plans, budgets and forecasts, as well as weekly cash balances held worldwide to ensure that optimal use is made of liquid funds within the Group and to avoid unnecessary borrowing.
e Capital management The Group aims to manage its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
Capital is monitored primarily by reference to the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, which also assists in ensuring the Group maintains the current strength of its consolidated balance sheet as represented by the level of net debt to equity shareholders funds.
Although net cash is reported at year end, it is considered appropriate that the Group would operate up to a maximum ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA of 1.0.
This maximum takes into account the prole of gross cash and gross debt across the Groups worldwide operations, the ongoing level of net retirement benefit obligations 2010: 138.7 million, 2009: 162.2 million, and the bonds and guarantees issued on behalf of the Company and its subsidiares in the normal course of business.

These lawsuits have alleged that the defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partly-owned subsidiary of Charter Limited.
Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in the defendants favour either at trial or on appeal.
In subsequent years, the defendants have continued to be named in asbestos-related lawsuits.
The defendants have contested these actions and, in most cases, have obtained dismissals.
The defendants have settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against the defendants in which they have received service of process are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs.
The Directors have received legal advice that the defendants and their wholly-owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages which might ensue if liability were imposed on any of the defendants.
The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charters operating profits in 2010 were negligible.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
ii Welding The ESAB Group Inc. EGI, an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables.
Other current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various other defendants such as distributors, trade associations and others.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts.
Charter International plc 102 Annual Report 2010 2010 review Directors and corporate governance Financial statements Other information 01 35 36 57 58 114 115 116 27 Contingent liabilities continued There are three manganese fume trials scheduled for the balance of 2011.
Additional trials could also be scheduled.
During 2010 EGI was not a defendant in any trials that were tried to verdict.
For more than 20 years, the Welding Industry Defense group, which was established to represent a number of the welding company defendants, including EGI, in this and other litigation, has succeeded in obtaining defence verdicts in the vast majority of cases in which one or more of its members have been named as a defendant.
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGIs counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously.
EGIs defence costs, in relation to the manganese fume cases, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$8.6 million, which is reected in EGIs balance sheet at 31 December 2010.
In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charters financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege asbestos-induced personal injuries.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts from EGI, other welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products.
EGI has two asbestos cases listed for trial in 2011 although it is not anticipated that they will proceed to trial as scheduled.
EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant.
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGIs insurers.
iii Air and gas handling Howden North America Inc. formerly Howden Buffalo Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United States.
On the advice of counsel, Howden North America is vigorously defending all the cases that have been led against it.
Over the past few years, Howden North America has sought and received dismissals in 11,493 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 455 cases.
These cases were typically settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial.
Howden North America has received legal advice indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought.
At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost of the settlements have been covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance.
The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos-related lawsuits against Howden North America, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden North America known as Buffalo Forge Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance.
The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden North America, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
iv Other In addition there are contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business from which no liability is expected to crystallise.
Various of the Companys subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys financial position.
