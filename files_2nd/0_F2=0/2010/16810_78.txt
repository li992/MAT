Taxation continued At 31 March 2010 the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 6-10 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 12 4,070 4,082 Losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised 1,820 57 100,396 102,273 1,832 57 104,466 106,355 Included above are losses amounting to 1,909 million 2009: 1,940 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The losses above also include 83,168 million 2009: 77,780 million that have arisen in overseas holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
Since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
During the year the German tax authorities decided to allow 13,513 million of a potential 46,716 million of losses arising on the write down of investments in Germany see Taxation on page 26.
These losses are available to use against both federal and trade tax liabilities in Germany.
Losses of 3,922 million 1,747 million for federal tax and 2,175 million for trade tax are included in the above table on which the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on 14,544 million 9,391 million for federal tax and 5,153 million for trade tax of the losses as it is uncertain that these losses will be utilised.
The Group holds provisions in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the year end reporting date.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 51,783 million 2009: 63,551 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.
