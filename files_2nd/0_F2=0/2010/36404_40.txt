The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy tenants and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third party guarantees as a means of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse tenant base.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 11 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversified range of banks and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises long-term debenture stock and drawings against committed revolving credit facilities from banks.
Liquidity risk The Group operates a framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding requirements.
Cash flow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversified across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
Annual review Governance Financials 91 14 Financial instruments continued The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the utilisation of its revolving credit facilities.
The availability of these facilities depends on the Group complying with a number of key financial covenants: these covenants and the Groups compliance with these covenants are set out in the table below: March 2010 Key covenants Covenant Actuals Group 0.26x Net debt net equity 1.25x Inner borrowing 1.66x 5.43x Interest cover 1.30x 3.55x Joint venture GCP Loan to value 70% 45.6% The Group has undrawn credit facilities of 417 million and has substantial headroom above all of its key covenants.
As a result the directors consider the Group to have adequate liquidity to be able to fund the ongoing operations of the business.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity on its financial instruments and have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is required to pay and conditions existing at the balance sheet date.

It is the risk that future cash flows from a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy either to eliminate interest rate risk over the cash flows on its long-term debt finance through the use of fixed rate debentures or to mitigate the risk through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps, caps, collars and swaptions.
It is the Groups policy to maintain the proportion of floating rate interest rate exposure to between 20%40% of forecast total interest rate cost.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2010 92 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 14 Financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps enable the Group to exchange its floating rate interest payments on its bank debt for fixed rate payments on a notional value.
Such contracts allow the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on its variable rate bank loans by locking in a fixed rate on a proportion of its debt.
Interest rate swaptions An interest rate swaption provides the Group with an option to enter into a interest rate swap on a specified future exercise date at a set price.
On the exercise date the Group can either enter into the interest rate swap or let the option lapse.
Such contracts act as an insurance policy against future interest rate rises.
Interest rate collars An interest rate collar is an interest rate cap combined with an interest rate floor.
In a floor arrangement if the underlying interest rate falls below a specified rate the floor the Group will make a payment based upon the difference between the underlying rate and the floor.
Therefore an interest rate collar gives the Group certainty that the interest rate it will pay will only fluctuate between the floor and the cap giving certainty that its interest rate exposure can only fluctuate within these restricted parameters.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate derivatives outstanding at 31 March: Average contracted fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 % % m m m m Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaptions In excess of five years 4.00% 100.0 1.1 Interest rate swaps Between two and five years 5.48% 165.0 16.4 Interest rate collars Between two and five years 4.68%6.5% 25.0 2.1 100.0 190.0 1.1 18.5 As at 31 March 2010 the aggregate amount of unrealised losses in respect of cash flow hedges was 4.6 million 2009: 16.4 million.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both non-derivative and derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date and represent managements assessment of reasonably possible changes in interest rates.
For the floating liabilities the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability at 31 March 2010 was outstanding for the whole year.
