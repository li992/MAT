Fair value hierarchy As of 1 April 2009, the Group has adopted the amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of how the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value, fit within the following fair value hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
Level 2 financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, commodity pricing contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts are determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of the future cash flows based on observable inputs drawn from interest yield curves sourced from a reputable third party source.
The amount shown within level 2 for borrowings only includes those borrowings which are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges with respect to interest rate risk and whose carrying amount is adjusted for the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Level 3 financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity at the balance sheet date.
These inputs generally reflect the entitys own assumptions about how a market participant would reasonably be expected to determine the price of a financial instrument.
For commodity pricing contracts, in evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Group generally classifies assets or liabilities as level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually, or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs represent more than 10% of the fair value of the observable inputs of the assets or liabilities.
Available-for-sale financial assets which are analysed at level 3 primarily represent investments in unlisted securities.
The fair values of the unlisted securities are approximated at cost.
Hence, value is adjusted only for permanent impairment and for no other movement.
For financial instruments in level 3, the Group does not consider that changes to inputs to reasonable alternatives would have a material impact on the income statement or equity.
