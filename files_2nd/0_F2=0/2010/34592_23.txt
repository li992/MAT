The fair value of the Groups investment and development property as at 31 December 2010 was determined by independent external valuers at that date.
The valuations conform with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Standards 6th Edition and with IVS 1 of International Valuation Standards, and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent, taking into account forecast growth rates and yields based on known transactions for similar properties and likely incentives offered to tenants.
A summary of the market value of investment and development property by valuer is given below: 2010 m DTZ 3,978.9 CBRE 845.2 Knight Frank 242.8 Others 32.2 5,099.1 Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value.
There are certain restrictions on the realisability of investment property when a credit facility is in place.
In most circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset.
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.

In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent.
Standard turnover based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail units annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases for continuing operations are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Not later than one year 345.2 341.9 Later than one year and not later than five years 1,139.3 1,114.9 Later than five years 1,493.3 1,198.8 2,977.8 2,655.6 The income statement includes 0.6 million 2009 0.8 million recognised in respect of expected increased rent resulting from outstanding reviews where the actual rent will only be determined on settlement of the rent review.
32 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Groups operations being principally market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department and the policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises of both cash flow and fair value risks: Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the Financial review on pages 22 to 27.
90 Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the accounts Continued 32 Financial risk management continued The below table shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2010 2010 2009 2009 m m m m Borrowings 292.4 2,505.1 583.9 3,304.7 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 2,117.6 2,117.6 3,244.0 3,244.0 Net borrowings profile 2,410.0 387.5 3,827.9 60.7 Interest rate protection on floating debt 84.5% 98.2% Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 4.98 per cent 2009 5.25 per cent.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 93.8 million 2009 99.6 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 97.7 million 2009 104.2 million in the fair value of derivatives.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are dealt with in the income statement.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Because the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than sterling.
It has been Group policy to substantially eliminate any material foreign exchange risk through hedging instruments and foreign currency denominated borrowings.
However, following completion of the Equity One transaction, the Group is reviewing its currency hedging policy and therefore the existing currency swaps may not be renewed as they mature.
The table summarises the Group exposure to foreign currency risk arising from the Groups US subsidiaries at 31 December 2010: Group Group 2010 2009 US$m US$m Net assets total US dollar exposure 199.7 161.2 Derivative impact nominal forward foreign exchange swaps 140.0 270.0 Net exposure 59.7 108.8 There was no ineffectiveness arising as a result of these hedges in either year.
Certain other Group investments are denominated in currencies other than sterling, however, they do not currently constitute material risks under the Group risk framework.
This remains under constant review.

Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective through maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities to meet these requirements.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 28.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years: as at 31 December 2010, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of six years 2009 five years.
This increases to 8.0 years following completion of the Trafford Centre acquisition in January 2011.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by using a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by re-borrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The Group will often pre-fund significant capital expenditure by arranging facilities or raising debt in the capital markets and then placing surplus funds on deposit until required for the project.
Efficient treasury management and strict credit control minimise the costs and risk associated with this policy which ensures that funds are available to meet commitments as they fall due.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal including notional principal in the case of gross settled foreign exchange contracts.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits, loans and derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and, wherever possible, identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2010 is 2.5 million 2009 3.3 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2010 2009 m m Up to three months 12.3 24.3 Three to six months 3.2 3.5 Trade receivables 15.5 27.8 Included within receivables at 31 December 2009 were 8.3 million of loan notes.
There are no loan notes within receivables at 31 December 2010.
In 2010, trade receivables impaired in respect of continuing operations amounted to 2.6 million 2009 4.1 million, this is considered to be within an acceptable range given current economic conditions.
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and hybrid financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio.
The Groups stated medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 40-50 per cent range and interest cover to be greater than 160 per cent.
At 31 December 2010 the debt to asset ratio falls within the preferred range and the interest cover ratio has moved closer to the preferred level.

For those UK properties qualifying as REIT properties the relevant tax rate will be 0 per cent 2009 0 per cent, for other UK nonREIT properties the relevant tax rate will be 27 per cent 2009 28 per cent and for overseas properties the relevant tax rate will be the prevailing corporate tax rate in that country.
The deferred tax provision on non-REIT investment properties calculated under IAS 12 is nil at 31 December 2010 2009 42.8 million.
This IAS 12 calculation does not reflect the expected amount of tax that would be payable if the assets were sold.

The separation was effected by way of a demerger of the central London focused property investment and development division to a new company called Capital & Counties Properties PLC Capco.
The demerger became unconditional on 7 May 2010.
The demerger was effected through a reduction of capital.
This involved the cancellation of the share premium account followed by the transfer of demerged assets to Capco in consideration for which Capco issued to shareholders of CSC one ordinary share for each CSC ordinary share held.
The share premium account cancelled amounted to 1,005.7 million.

Consideration was in the form of approximately 11.4 million shares in the joint venture and 4.1 million shares in Equity One common stock, resulting in an estimated gain on disposal of 26 million.
The Groups investment in these shares will be accounted for as an available-for-sale investment as the Group does not have control nor significant influence over the venture.

104 Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the accounts Continued 45 Share-based payment The Group operates a number of share based payment arrangements providing employee benefits and incentives.
All schemes are equity settled, and as such the expense recognised in the income statement is assessed based on the fair value of the equity instruments awarded as determined at their grant date.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Approved Share Option Scheme and the Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Exercise is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition which requires Capital Shopping Centres Group smoothed earnings to grow over a three year period commencing with the year of grant at a rate in excess of 5 per cent per annum compound.
Smoothed earnings growth means the percentage increase in underlying earnings per share, adjusted by a excluding exceptional and valuation items and b limiting trading or non-recurring items to 10 per cent of profit before tax.
For the award made in 2009 exceptionally, the base figure for comparison purposes will be the smoothed earnings achieved in 2009 for comparison with the three year period commencing with 2010.
Except in the case of a good leaver, options may not be exercised within three years of grant and before satisfaction or waiver of any applicable performance condition, and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options become capable of exercise.
The options automatically lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
As a result of the demerger the number of options attributed to each option holder was increased by a factor of 1.32 while the option price was reduced by dividing by 1.32.
During the year individuals who received awards made in 2009 and 2010 were given the option to modify their awards.
Where this modification option was taken, the future exercise of their existing share options was capped based on the share price at the date of modification and they participate in the Joint Share Ownership Plan from that date as described below.
As required by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the fair value of the award is measured immediately before the modification and immediately after and any increase in fair value must be recognised as an expense through the income statement over the performance period.
Under this test it was found that no additional expense was required.

Conditions for exercise including satisfaction of the same performance condition, forfeiture and lapsing are as set out above for options generally.
As set out above no additional accounting charge was required for modified awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 0.71 per award 2009 no awards.
