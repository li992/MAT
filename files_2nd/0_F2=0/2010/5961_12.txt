Fidessa group plc 47 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Fidessa group plc Fidessa or the Company, is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 11th February 2011.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Groups business activities and position in its market are described in the Overview and Market Review.
The directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertainties as far as the global economy is concerned.
The Group has considerable financial resources, no borrowings, a high level of recurring revenue and a broad spread of customers.
As a consequence of these factors and having reviewed the forecasts for the coming year, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS or IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
1 Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of financial instruments which are stated in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The following standards and interpretations have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements: IFRS3 Business Combinations 2008 and consequential amendments to IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, IAS28 Investments in Associates, IAS31 Interests in Joint Ventures, IFRS2 Share-based Payment and IAS38 Intangible Assets the amendments are effective prospectively.
The amendments had no impact on the Companys or Groups result or financial position but will be effective for any future business combinations.
IFRS1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards revised the amendments had no impact on the Companys or Groups financial statements.
IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement revised the amendments had no impact on the Companys or Groups financial statements.
IFRS2 Share-based Payment revised the amendments had no impact on the Companys or Groups financial statements.
Annual Improvements to IFRS 2009, IFRIC17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, IFRIC18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and amendments to IFRIC9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives, IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, IFRS5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, IAS7 Statement of Cash Flows, IAS17 Leases, IAS18 Revenue and IAS36 Impairment of Assets these had no impact on the Companys or Groups financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results for which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates, assumptions and judgements that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised in note 22.
Fidessa group plc 48 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently by the Group and Company to all periods presented in these financial statements.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Fidessa group plc and its subsidiaries.
There are no associates or joint ventures to be included in the consolidated accounts.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain the benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date on which control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Pounds Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Pounds Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Pounds Sterling at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the translation of the Groups net investment in foreign entities are recognised in the translation reserve.
On disposal of a foreign entity the cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement and recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
c Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
For acquisitions on or after 1st January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
For acquisitions between 1st January 2004 and 31st December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Transaction costs that the Group incurred in connection with a business combination were capitalised Fidessa group plc 49 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 as part of the cost of the acquisition.
Any contingent consideration payable was recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration were recognised as an adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004 were recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework, UK GAAP.
d Revenue Revenue represents the fair value for consideration received or receivable from customers for software and related services supplied by the Group, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue is derived from sales directly to end users and not from sales through resellers.
Revenue is only recognised where there is persuasive evidence that a contract exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
Full allowance is made for all known or expected losses.
Recurring revenue is derived from the provision of software rental, software as a service, connectivity services, market data and support services.
Revenue for these services is recognised monthly over the period that the service is to be provided, taking account of any free of charge periods.
Non-recurring revenue is derived from the provision of implementation, consultancy, reconfiguration support and training services entirely related to Fidessa products.
These services are predominantly chargeable on a time and materials basis and the revenue is recognised when the work is performed.
When implementations are performed on a fixed price basis the revenue is recognised over the period of implementation in accordance with the estimated percentage completed for each contract, based on the anticipated number of days of effort for the implementation.
Recurring and non-recurring services can be separately identified in contracts and the fair value determined respectively.
Deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced to customers for services not yet supplied.
Accrued revenue represents amounts recognised as revenue to be invoiced in a future period.
e Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share incentive plans.
The fair value of the incentives granted is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the incentives granted is measured using a binomial model or a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the incentives were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share incentives that vest except where forfeiture is only due to the share price not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
f Post employment benefits Certain subsidiaries operate defined contribution pension schemes for their employees.
Pension costs are charged to the income statement as they arise.
g Interest receivable Interest receivable on interest-bearing financial assets is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate used reflects the anticipated cash flows to be received.
Fidessa group plc 50 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued h Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The cost is the purchase price of the goods received.
Purchased software that is integral to the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
Depreciation is provided by the Group to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Equipment and furniture 35 years Computers 23 years Motor vehicles 4 years Buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements 510 years or remainder of lease if shorter j Intangible assets Research and development Expenditure on research into areas such as potential new technologies, methodologies and architectures is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Product development relates to the design, programming and testing of new and enhanced inter-related products.
It is a continual process without defined end dates.
Costs incurred on product development are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development will provide economic benefits, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, resources are available for the development, and costs can be measured reliably.
The expenditure capitalised is the direct labour cost and is managed and controlled centrally.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Product development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Capitalised product development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Product development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the time of development on a straight-line basis over three years.
Fidessa group plc 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups interest in the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is stated at the amount recognised on acquisition date less any accumulated impairment losses.
Acquisition intangibles Intangible assets acquired from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition and amortised over their estimated useful economic life.
Their carrying value is the fair value at acquisition less cumulative amortisation and any impairments.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows: Customer relationships 10 years Complete technology 3 years Brands and other marketing related 3 years Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are purchased by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The cost is the purchase price of the asset.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Software purchased for internal use is amortised over two years.
k Impairment of assets Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are no larger than an operating segment for the purposes of impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates is estimated and the carrying amount is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
In an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use for the Group.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash generating units or assets value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating unit or asset that have not already been included in the estimate of future cash flows.
l Leased assets Where the Group enters into an operating lease the rentals are charged as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
m Investments and financial instruments Investments in subsidiary companies, which are all unquoted equity investments, are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Fidessa group plc 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued A financial instrument is recognised if the Company or Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised if the Groups contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Groups obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
n Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost, their carrying value being reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
o Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
p Trade payables Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
q Grants Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss as a deduction from the related expense over the periods in which the expense is recognised.
r Employee Benefit Trust and Share Bonus Trust The Employee Benefit Trust and Share Bonus Trust, which purchase and hold ordinary shares of the Company in connection with employee share schemes, are included in the Companys financial statements and presented as a deduction from equity.
Any consideration paid or received by the trusts for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders equity.
s Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
No provision is recognised when it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability and instead a contingent liability is disclosed.

Management consider that earnings per share after these adjustments provide a better year to year comparison of performance.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of cash generating units.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the revenue, operating margin and net operating cash flows.
These take into account the existing customer base and revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of the product offerings and the specific market trends that are currently seen or expected in the future.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of LatentZero results from the value of the assembled workforce, the synergistic nature of the acquisition due to the long-term cross-selling opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side clients, potential cost savings, the expected future growth and the acceleration of the Groups operations into the buy-side.
The LatentZero acquisition goodwill has been assigned to the Buy-side and Hosted business units.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the latest approved forecasts for the following year which have been extended for the following four years based on estimated growth rates of between 10% and 20% which management consider reflects a reasonable future rate for the cash generating units after considering recent growth rates, the increasing amount of recurring revenue, assessing the market opportunities and threats and the potential to expand the addressable market.
For each cash generating unit a declining rate of cash flow growth to 5% and a terminal growth of 2% has been assumed after the five year period as the expected useful life is materially greater than five years.
This is considered to reflect a cautious long-term average growth rate for the products and services.
Future cash flows are discounted in line with the appropriate discount rate for each cash generating unit of 10% pre-tax 2009: 10%.
These have been calculated after assessing the specific risk premium for each cash generating unit, current gilt rates and the businesss beta factor.
The recoverable amount for the Buy-side cash generating unit is sensitive to the improvement in operating margin that is achieved.
The value in use calculation assumes that a long-term operating margin of 13% is achieved and for this the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value by 17,800,000.
If the long-term operating margin should be only 9% then the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying value.

The estimated life for complete technology was revised from five years to three years, becoming consistent with the estimated life for product development that the Group undertakes.
The estimated life for brands and marketing related assets was revised from eight years to three years, reflecting the prevalence of the Fidessa brand as the synergistic opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side continued to develop.
The estimated life of customer relationships remained unchanged at 10 years as no material change in this area had been detected.
The impact of these changes to estimated life is that the amortisation for the 2009 year increased from 1,639,000 to 4,097,000 for complete technology and from 262,000 to 1,247,000 for brands and marketing.

The business subsequently changed its name to Touchpaper Group Limited Touchpaper.
Following the divestment, the Company held financial assets in Touchpaper comprising preference shares, ordinary shares, warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares and loan notes.
Since July 2001 the Company had no financial influence or operational involvement in the Touchpaper business and their results had not been consolidated into Fidessas performance.
In the year to 31st December 2007 Touchpaper had reported revenue of 17.5 million, profit before tax of 0.4 million and gross assets of 9.4 million under UK GAAP.
On 30th June 2008 Avocent Ireland Holdings Limited acquired the entire share capital of Touchpaper and the preference shares and loan notes were redeemed.
The Company received proceeds in 2008 of 11,035,000 for the sale and redemption of the ordinary and preference shares, 1,900,000 for the redemption of the loan notes and 488,000 for the accrued interest on the loan notes.
The sale agreement provided for amounts held in escrow in respect of working capital at completion as well as indemnities and general warranties.
During 2009, 346,000 was received in settlement of the working capital at completion escrow.
The period for indemnity and general warranty claims expired on 30th June 2010.
1,180,000 of the Fidessa group plc 63 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 value of this escrow was recognised in 2009 and a further 2,179,000 has been recognised in 2010.
All cash in respect of the indemnities and general warranties escrow has been received during 2010 and no further proceeds are expected.

All shares rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.
Cumulative translation adjustment The cumulative translation adjustment comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued by the Company to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement, which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree, must apply Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
When applicable, the section requires that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, the Company did not record a premium on the shares it issued but recognised a merger reserve in the consolidated balance sheet.
Dividends paid and proposed On 29th March 2010 the 2009 second interim dividend of 20.0 pence per share, 7,110,000, 2009: final dividend for 2008 of 17.0 pence per share, 5,988,000 was paid.
Also, on 29th March 2010 a special dividend of 40.0 pence per share, 14,219,000, was paid.
On 27th September 2010 an interim dividend of 11.0 pence per share, 3,926,000, 2009: 10.0 pence per share, 3,543,000 was paid.
The directors propose a final dividend of 22.0 pence per share, 7,893,000, and a special dividend of 45.0 pence per share, 16,145,000.
These will be payable on 13th June 2011 to shareholders on the register on 13th May 2011, with an ex-dividend date of 11th May 2011.
These dividends are subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and have not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

All share incentives are over ordinary shares of the Company.
The Company grants share incentives to employees in the form of share options, share bonuses and under the Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan.
The fair value of incentives is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The employee expense is recognised equally over the time from grant until vesting of the incentive.
For share options and share bonuses the fair value has been measured using a binomial model.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility.
The material inputs into the model have been: Share options Granted in 2006 Granted in 2007 Granted in 2009 Granted in 2010 Fair value 190p 267p 276p 299p Share price at grant 860p 949p 1154p 1421p Exercise price 860p 949p 1154p 1421p Expected volatility 25% 30% 30% 30% Expected life 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Expected dividends 2.9% 2.2% 2.2% 3.0% Risk-free rate of return 4.7% 5.0% 2.5% 2.0% Share bonuses Awards in 2007 Awards in 2008 Awards in 2009 Awards in 2010 Fair value 775p to 456p to 1029p to 1314p to 1116p 672p 1245p 1421p Share price at purchase 829p to 482p to 1100p to 1438p to 1193p 710p 1330p 1555p Expected volatility 30% 30% 30% 30% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends 2.2% 1.8% 2.2% 3.0% Fidessa group plc 66 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The fair value of the award under the Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan EGRIP has been measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

The remuneration of individual directors is disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The remuneration of directors and other members of key management during the year was as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Short-term employee benefits 4,913 5,211 Post employment benefits 13 8 Equity compensation benefits 605 481 Total remuneration of directors and key management 5,531 5,700 20 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These are designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group, and primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, which arise in the normal course of the Groups business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose the Group to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Our largest customer accounts for less than 5% of Group revenue and the 10 largest customers account for less than 30% of Group revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in the Groups treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty and the maximum duration of a deposit.
Fidessa group plc 68 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The trade receivables for the Group as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
2010 2009 000 000 Not due 34,030 34,184 Not more than three months past due 23,007 21,596 More than three months but not more than six months past due 2,097 1,892 More than six months past due 1,759 2,803 Total trade receivables 60,893 60,475 All material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance being due to insolvency or age of receivable.
In most situations where a receivable is aged but no specific allowance has been made for it, no revenue has been taken and it forms part of the deferred revenue balance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group makes an allowance when the settlement of a receivable becomes doubtful.
The uncertain economic conditions and the higher than normal occurrence of insolvencies, consolidation and cost cutting in the customer base has led to the new allowances in the year.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables is in the table below.
2010 2009 000 000 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 1st January 1,254 1,369 Exchange adjustment 112 43 Allowances released in the period 856 947 New allowances made in the period 2,948 875 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 31st December 3,458 1,254 Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities at 31st December 2010.
3 months Greater than Carrying or less 3-12 months 1 year amount 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 3,374 3,374 Accrued expenses 28,939 2,782 1,036 32,757 It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis will arise materially earlier or at significantly different values.
Interest receivable and payable The Group holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
Due to the strong cash generation of the business, the Group has no borrowings.
Fidessa group plc 69 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Foreign currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into Sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollars, Euros and Japanese Yen.
The Group has both cash inflows and outflows in these currencies that create a natural hedge.
In managing currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups cash inflows and outflows in a foreign currency.
The Group has not entered into hedging contracts for cash positions denominated in foreign currencies.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of Sterling against other currencies would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 167,000 for the year ended 31st December 2010 2009: 127,000.
Capital management The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
The annual dividends have increased at a similar rate to the growth in earnings per share.
The level of annual dividend provides a regular return to shareholders whilst also providing growth in the cash resources available to fund acquisitions or other investment activity.
Special dividends have been used to return surplus funds to shareholders.
The Board monitors the retained cash and reserves and determines the level of annual dividend, and when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
For current trade and other receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the amortised cost is deemed to reflect the fair value.
21 Operating leases At 31st December the Group had outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Less than one year 14,820 12,145 Between one and five years 41,605 40,668 More than five years 62,095 64,894 Total commitment under operating leases 118,520 117,707 The Group leases office space and data centre facilities under operating leases.
The lease term typically ranges from three years to 20 years, longer term leases normally having options to break the commitment before the end of the term.
Lease terms of greater than five years are often subject a rent review during the term.
Part of the office space has been sublet to an entity outside of the Fidessa group.
The sublease expires in December 2012.
Sublease receipts of 776,000 are expected during the remainder of the sublease.
Fidessa group plc 70 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates, assumptions and judgements that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised below.
This summary is not a list of all risks, estimates and judgements encountered by the Group and others could arise that cause a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
a Development expenditure The Group invests in the development of future products and enhancement of existing products in accordance with the accounting policy.
The assessment as to whether material elements of this expenditure will be technically feasible, generate future economic benefit or the period over which to amortise the expenditure is a matter of judgement.
The carrying value of product development capitalised is detailed in note 12 and the amounts capitalised and amortised in the year are detailed in note 5. b Income taxes In recognising income tax assets and liabilities estimates have to be made of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain and on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
c Revenue The revenue for fixed price implementations is recognised on a percentage of completion basis for each contract.
Management exercises judgement in determining the percentage complete for non-recurring revenue and the total cost of implementation.
Management also makes estimates in determining the fair value of the elements of service provided in a contract and the value of discounts given.
Estimates are continually revised based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
d Fair values IFRSs require many assets, liabilities and expenses to be recognised at fair value.
This includes the intangible assets note 12 and other liabilities arising from acquisitions.
By their nature fair values are estimates and subject to different interpretation.
e Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the cash generating units, managements estimates of discount rates, long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates note 12.
If the results of the cash generating unit in a future period are materially adverse to the estimates used for the impairment testing an impairment charge may be triggered.
f Expected useful lives The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and the respective depreciation and amortisation of these assets is affected by the assumptions made in determining the expected useful lives of the assets.
Management makes estimates of the useful lives and regularly reviews these estimates.
