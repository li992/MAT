The volume of calls made in each of these bands is different for internal and external traffic.
Therefore the 24 hour rate will be different.
g When looking at the year on year change the difference will be distorted by the fact that the volumes will be different between one year and another.
The % change shown is based on a combination of both the old and new charge controls.
j The RPI used for compliance purposes in 2009 10 is -1.57% which is based on the monthly RPI from June 2008 to June 2009. z The average charges are an annual weighting for the entire reporting year taking account of all price changes within the period.
