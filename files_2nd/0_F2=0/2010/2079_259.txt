Post-retirement mortality assumptions in the Americas, Europe and South Africa are based on post-retirement mortality tables that are standard in these regions.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected rate of return on each applicable asset class and reflects the long-term target asset allocation as at the reporting date.
For bonds, the expected rate of return reflects the redemption yields available on corporate and government bonds, as applicable, as at the reporting date.
For all other asset classes, the expected rate of return reflects the rate of return expected over the long term.
For the main funds, these tables imply the following expected future lifetimes in years for employees aged 65 as at the balance sheet date: US males 19.8, US females 21.6: Canadian males 19.4, Canadian females 21.8: Netherlands males 19.0, Netherlands females 21.1: UK males 22.4, UK females 24.8: South African males 14.8, South African females 18.7.
