68 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2010 1.
General information Aegis Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 124.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Directors Report on pages 44 to 47.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union and comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting for the reasons set out in the Directors report on page 47.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below in note 3.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective for the year: IFRS 7 amended Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets IAS 24 revised 2009 Related Party Transactions IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Improvements to IFRSs May 2010 Amendments to IAS 12 Dec 2010 Amendments to IFRS 1 Dec 2010 Amendments to IAS 32 Oct 2009 Amendments to IFRIC 14 Nov 2009 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The Group plans to adopt IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for the year beginning on 1 January 2013.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9 will have a material impact on the accounting for fair value hedges and the measurement of the hedged items under fair value hedging relationships.
This change will have no net impact on profit or loss, but will lead to additional movements recognised within equity.
There would also be additional disclosure requirements around financial instruments.
The Directors anticipate that, with the exception of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Adoption of standards In the current financial year, the Group has adopted IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations and IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
Following adoption of these standards, the Group has prospectively applied the policies for business combinations and changes in ownership of controlled entities effected from 1 January 2010 see note 3 Business combinations and Goodwill.
As part of the adoption of these standards, the Group is required to rename Minority interests as Non-controlling interests NCI.
Accordingly, the Potential acquisition of minority interests reserve is renamed the Potential acquisition of non-controlling interests reserve.
The Directors expect that the adoption of this standard will lead to greater income statement volatility, since the Group will be required to recognise acquisition costs and changes in deferred consideration estimates arising on business combinations effected from 1 January 2010 in the income statement.
In addition to the standards discussed above, the following standards and interpretations were adopted by the Group in the current period.
These standards have no effect on the financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 2 amended Group Cash-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions IAS 39 amended Eligible Hedged Items and Embedded Derivatives on Reclassifications of Financial Assets IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers Improvements to IFRSs April 2009 The Group did not adopt IFRS for small and medium-sized entities as the Group is a listed entity, and hence falls outside the scope of this Standard.
All of the amendments to IFRS 1 that were effective on or after period Jan 2010 were not applicable to the Group as the Group is not a first time adopter of IFRS, and hence were not adopted.
69 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 2.
Basis of preparation continued Underlying profit The Group believes that underlying results note 4 and underlying earnings per share note 11 provide additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The term underlying is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements of profit.
In the opinion of the Directors, such adjusting items are material by nature or amount, and may include impairment charges, profits and losses on disposals of investments, amortisation of purchased intangible assets being amortisation charged on separately identifiable intangible assets in acquired businesses, unrealised gains and losses on non-hedge derivative financial instruments, fair value gains and losses on liabilities in respect of put option agreements, and one-off items which are material by nature or amount in the opinion of the Directors, and any related tax thereon, as appropriate.
Adjusting items may also include specific tax items such as the benefit arising on the reduction of certain tax liabilities in a particular period and deferred tax liabilities for tax deductions taken in respect of goodwill, where a deferred tax liability is recognised even if such a liability would only unwind on the eventual sale or impairment of the business in question.
In 2010, the Group has adopted the revised accounting standard for acquisition accounting, IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations.
This standard will lead to greater income statement volatility, as discussed above.
These income statement movements will not be considered to form part of the Groups underlying performance.
In order to align with the accounting for such movements as non-underlying, imputed interest arising due to discounting of deferred consideration liabilities is also removed from underlying results in the current year and in the stated comparatives for 2009 full year.
The impact of the restatement is a reduction of 1.1m in the 2009 full year underlying finance costs.
This leads to an increase in underlying profit before tax and underlying profit after tax by 1.1m and an increase in underlying basic EPS and underlying diluted EPS by 0.1p in the 2009 full year comparative.
The restatement has no impact on tax charges in either period but leads to a restatement of the effective underlying tax rate as given in note 9.
There is no impact on statutory profit measures.
Accounting policies Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented in this Annual Report.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cash flows and net assets of Aegis Group plc and the entities controlled by it its subsidiaries after eliminating internal transactions and recognising any non-controlling interests in those entities drawn up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Where subsidiaries are acquired or disposed of in the year, their results and cash flows are included from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective disposal date.
Where a consolidated company is less than 100% owned by the Group, the non-controlling interest share of the results and net assets are recognised at each reporting date.
The interests of non-controlling shareholders are ordinarily measured at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets, but may alternatively be initially measured at fair value.
The choice of measurement is made on an  basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the noncontrolling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, on the date control is achieved the Group remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value, with any resulting gain or loss presented in profit or loss.
Any amounts previously deferred in other comprehensive income are recognised on the same basis as if the Group had directly disposed of the equity interest.
Changes in the Groups interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
The carrying amount of the Groups interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of the parent.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between i the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and ii the previous carrying amount of the assets including goodwill, less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings as appropriate, in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of.
The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of the reclassified investment.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 70 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation continued a Subsidiaries continued A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given in the notes to the Companys separate financial statements.
The companies listed immediately below are included in the consolidated financial statements of Aegis Group plc: as such we apply S264b HGB of the German Commercial Code.
Aegis Media GmbH & Co. KG, Central Services, Wiesbaden CARAT Wiesbaden GmbH & Co. KG Media-Service, Wiesbaden HMS GmbH & Co. KG Media-Service, Wiesbaden CARAT Hamburg GmbH & Co. KG.
Media-Service, Hamburg 21 TwentyOne GmbH & Co. KG Markenberatung, Wiesbaden Mediaagentur Dr. Pichutta GmbH & Co. KG, Wiesbaden b Associates Associates are entities in which the Group has a participating interest, over whose operating and financial policies it exercises significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over these policies.
The reporting dates and accounting policies used by the Groups associates are the same as those used by the Group.
The Groups associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill within the associates carrying amount and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
The Groups share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses and any impairment of goodwill is recognised in the income statement and as a movement in the Groups share of associates net assets in the balance sheet.
Its share of any post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised directly in equity.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
c Joint ventures Joint ventures are investments over which the Group exercises joint control with a third party.
Such investments are equityaccounted for, using the same method of equity accounting as described in associates above.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes contingent consideration, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are adjusted against the cost of the acquisition when they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below, or otherwise are accounted for as fair value changes in profit or loss.
Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is recognised in equity.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts.
Provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
For acquisitions completed prior to 1 January 2010, the revaluation of contingent consideration does not result in an entry to profit or loss, but is adjusted against the carrying amount of associated goodwill.
Such contingent consideration liabilities are discounted and an imputed interest charge is included in the income statement.
Income statement movements in relation to changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying profit.
Therefore, concurrent with the adoption of IFRS 3 2008, imputed interest on deferred consideration is also excluded from underlying profit, as explained in the Underlying profit section in note 2.
71 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is achieved the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is not amortised but is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill recognised under UK GAAP prior to the date of transition to IFRS is stated at net book value as at that date less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill impairment Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
The Groups CGUs are given in note 12.
Intangible assets Separately acquired intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Fair value is calculated based on the Groups valuation methodology, using discounted cash flows, charges avoided or replacement costs as appropriate.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where these criteria are met, the development expenditure is capitalised at cost.
Where they are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets both internally generated and separately acquired are amortised to residual values on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of the asset as follows: Software 20% to 50% per annum Customer relationships 20% per annum Panel costs 33% per annum Patents and trademarks Nil to 20% per annum Non compete agreements 14% to 50% per annum Intellectual Property 33% per annum Other 10% to 50% per annum Where an assets useful life is considered indefinite, an annual impairment test is performed see below.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 72 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of these assets to their residual value over their expected useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis: Freehold buildings 1% to 5% per annum Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10% to 20% per annum or over the period of the lease, if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment and vehicles 10% to 50% per annum The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets both internally generated and separately acquired to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Work in progress Work in progress comprises directly attributable costs on incomplete market research projects and is held in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where leasehold properties remain unutilised by the Group and have not been sublet, provision is made in full for the outstanding rental payments together with other outgoings for the remaining period of the lease.
This provision takes into account any future sublet income reasonably expected to be obtained.
Future rental payments are charged against this provision in the period in which they are made.
From time to time the Group is exposed to claims which the Group vigorously defends.
Provision for costs is made when the likelihood of a case proceeding is adjudged as probable.
Disclosure is made of potentially material matters where, on the basis of legal advice, an adverse outcome cannot currently be judged as remote.
Turnover and revenue Turnover represents amounts billable for media handled by the Group on behalf of clients, together with fees earned for media and research services provided, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is the value of media and research fees and commission earned by the Group.
Media revenue arises in the form of fees and commissions for media services and performance related incentives.
Fee and commission revenue is recognised when earned, principally when advertisements appear in the media over the period of the relevant assignments or agreements.
Performance related income is recognised when it can be reliably estimated whether, and the extent to which, the performance criteria have been met.
For the market research business, revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of each project, which is indicated by the satisfactory completion of a specific phase of a project.
Provision is made for losses on a project as soon as it becomes clear that a loss will arise.
Invoices raised during the course of a project are booked as deferred income on the balance sheet until such a time as the related revenue is recognised in the income statement.
73 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Cost of media The direct cost of media bookings is the difference between turnover amounts invoiced to clients and revenue.
Investment income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Share-based payment transactions The Group applies the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that remained unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Certain employees receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, including shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the instruments concerned at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit and loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Retirement benefits The retirement benefits for employees are principally provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
The amount charged to the income statement is the contribution payable in the year by Group companies.
In addition, the Group has a small number of other retirement benefit schemes, principally where required by statute in certain jurisdictions.
These schemes are not considered by management to represent standard defined benefit schemes and do not vary significantly in terms of the Groups liability.
However, IAS 19 requires that these schemes be disclosed as defined benefit schemes.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit obligations is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost less the fair value of the plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the project unit credit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds approximating to the terms of the related liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately outside the income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are reported in Sterling, which is the functional currency of Aegis Group plc and the presentational currency for the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In group companies, the term foreign currencies refers to currencies other than the entitys functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Upon settlement, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate ruling on the settlement date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are re-translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon re-translation at the settlement date or balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of foreign currency borrowings used to provide a hedge against foreign currency investments, including goodwill, are taken directly to reserves as long as the hedge remains effective.
For consolidation purposes, the trading results and cash flows arising in operations with non-sterling functional currencies are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the period.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon consolidation are taken directly to reserves.
In the event of the disposal of an operation the cumulative effect of such translation is reclassified to profit or loss.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 74 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Leased assets Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability and recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations from the transition date of 1 January 2004 in respect of intangible assets and properties.
A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, including interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments Financial assets Financial assets are accounted for on the trade date.
The Groups financial assets principally include the following: Cash and short term deposits Cash and short term deposits include cash at bank and in hand and highly liquid deposits with an original maturity of three months or less which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are deducted from cash and short term deposits to give cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recorded at the invoiced value and subsequently reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Current trade receivables do not carry any interest charge.
Interest may be charged on overdue balances.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs, and at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through profit or loss.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL Fair Value Through Profit and Loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
75 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to the income statement as incurred using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Investments in own shares, held through the Aegis Group Employee Share Trust, are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity at cost.
The costs of administration of the Trust are included in the income statement as they accrue.
Compound instruments The Group issued 190.6m convertible bonds in April 2010.
The convertible bonds are regarded as compound financial instruments.
The component parts of compound instruments issued by the Group are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
At the date of issue, in the case of a convertible bond denominated in the functional currency of the issuer that may be converted into a fixed number of equity shares, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate that the Group could achieve for a similar non-convertible instrument.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or at the instruments maturity date.
The equity component is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole.
This is recognised and included within equity in the Other Equity Reserves and is not subsequently remeasured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The non-cash element of the interest charge is reclassified within equity at each period end to exclude the impact of the accounting charge from Retained Earnings.
This element of the charge is recognised within the Other Equity Reserves.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures where they are considered to be significant.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Where such changes are intended to provide a natural hedge of a particular risk, the income statement classification reflects this.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Note 19 includes further information on hedge accounting as applied by the Group.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely-related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 76 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments continued Liabilities in respect of option agreements with non-controlling shareholders The Group is party to a number of put and call options over the remaining non-controlling stakes in its subsidiaries.
In accordance with IAS 39, put options are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded at fair value on initial recognition with a corresponding decrease in reserves.
Fair value is calculated based on the discounted value of expected future payments.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as movements in the income statement.
Exercise and settlement of a put option liability is treated as an equity transaction, as explained in note 3 a on page 69.
Accounting estimates and uncertainties The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future and the resulting estimates may, by definition, vary from the related actual results.
The Directors consider the critical accounting estimates and judgements to be: Revenue recognition Judgement is required in selecting the appropriate timing and amount of revenue recognised, particularly where the Group recognises performance related income.
Revenue is only recognised when it can be reliably estimated using customer specific information and, where there is a performance related element, to the extent to which the performance criteria have been met The likelihood of collection of trade receivables also requires judgement to be applied.
The Group monitors the levels of provisioning required based on historical trends and by detailed review of individually significant balances Contingent deferred consideration and put option payments in respect of acquisitions The Group determines the amount of deferred consideration to be recognised according to the formulae agreed at time of acquisition, normally related to the future earnings of the acquired entity.
Estimates of the expected future earnings of the acquired entity therefore affect the valuation of deferred consideration.
The liability for deferred consideration is reviewed at each balance sheet date and revaluation entries are applied, if required, to deferred consideration and either goodwill or profit or loss in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for business combinations, discussed above Deferred consideration liabilities are discounted to their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 and IAS 37.
The difference between the fair value of these liabilities and the actual amounts payable is charged to the income statement as a notional finance cost Key areas of judgement in calculating the fair value of the put option liabilities are the expected future cash flows and earnings of the acquired entity and the discount rate Recognition of share-based payments The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a stochastic model The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grant.
The vesting period charge is calculated with reference to the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, as determined by the anticipated number of leavers during the vesting period and based on an annual assessment of non-market performance conditions attached to certain awards.
See note 30 for further details Valuation of intangible assets The Group exercises judgement in determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in business combinations.
In calculating the fair values of intangibles the Group makes assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets it has acquired, the appropriate discount rates and the useful economic lives of the assets purchased Impairment In determining whether an impairment loss has arisen on goodwill or intangible assets the Group makes judgements over the value in use of its CGUs.
In calculating the value in use of a CGU the Group makes estimates of future forecast cash flows and discount rates to derive a net present value of these cash flows and determine if an impairment has occurred.
Key areas of judgement include the determination of the long term growth rate applicable to each CGU and the determination of the CGUs themselves.
See note 12 for further details 77 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 3.
Accounting policies continued Accounting estimates and uncertainties continued Taxation Tax laws that apply to the Groups businesses may be amended by the relevant authorities, for example as a result of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities.
Such potential amendments and their application to the Group are regularly monitored and the requirement for recognition of any liabilities assessed where necessary Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure which makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes.
Such issues can take several years to resolve.
The Group takes a conservative view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore may impact the Groups results and future cash flows Deferred tax The key area of judgement in respect of deferred tax accounting is the assessment of the expected timing and manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date.
In particular, assessment is required of whether it is probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which any deferred tax assets can be utilised.
Segment reporting Business segments The segmentation of the Groups results is driven by information provided to the Groups chief operating decision-maker, the Board of Directors.
Information reported to the Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance focuses on the two business divisions through which the Group operates: Aegis Media and Synovate.
This segment presentation reflects the management structure of the Group.
These divisions, which operate in the media and market research sectors respectively, are therefore the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8.
Intersegment trading is not significant to either operating segment and no intersegment trading information is included in reports to the Board of Directors.
Therefore all information reported below relates to external trade.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3.
Segment result represents segment underlying operating profit, which is the measure reported to the Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The Board of Directors also monitors the tangible, intangible and financial assets attributable to each segment.
All assets and liabilities are allocated to reportable segments with the exception of centrally-managed financial instruments, tax and other centrally-managed balances.
Goodwill is allocated to the segments as described in note 12.

The weighted average number of shares excludes the Groups interest in own shares held through an employee share trust.
On 20 April 2010 the Group issued 190.6m convertible bonds due April 2015, bearing interest at 2.5%.
In calculating underlying diluted earnings per share above, the potential ordinary shares to be issued on conversion are added to the diluted weighted average number of shares, as if the bonds had converted on 20 April 2010.
The underlying profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent is also adjusted to include the interest and finance charges that would have been avoided if the bonds had converted on 20 April 2010.
This treatment has not been applied for statutory earnings per share, as the convertible bonds are accretive to statutory earnings per share.
Changes in the Groups accounting policies during the year are described in note 2.
The adoption of IFRS 3 revised 2008 and the associated alignment of the treatment of imputed interest on deferred consideration liabilities have the effect of increasing underlying EPS by 0.1p 2009: increasing underlying EPS by 0.1p and have no impact on statutory EPS.

Therefore such changes in estimate affect goodwill rather than profit or loss.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
This allocation largely represents the geographic areas of operation for the Groups two divisions as set out below.
2010 2009 m m Aegis Media: Europe, Middle East & Africa 305.9 292.6 Americas 195.2 172.9 Asia Pacific 382.2 117.0 Total 883.3 582.5 Synovate: Europe, Middle East & Africa 163.4 156.7 Americas 189.4 188.3 Asia Pacific 95.0 83.4 Total 447.8 428.4 1,331.1 1,010.9 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and management forecasts for the subsequent three years.
These calculations reflect managements experience and future expectations of the markets in which the CGU operates.
Long term average growth rates used in the projections range between 3.0% for mature markets and 5.0% for higher growth markets and vary with managements view of the CGUs market position and maturity of the relevant market.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11.5% for mature markets and 12.5% for the developing markets in Asia Pacific.
Further disclosures in accordance with paragraph 134 of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets are given for CGUs comprising at least 20% of the total carrying value of goodwill for the Group.
Goodwill allocated to the Aegis Media Europe, Middle East and Africa CGU is significant in comparison with the total amount of goodwill.
The goodwill of 305.9m has arisen on a large number of individually small acquisitions.
Goodwill allocated to the Aegis Media Asia Pacific CGU is also significant in comparison with the total amount of goodwill.
The goodwill of 382.2m has arisen on the 2010 acquisition of Mitchell Communication Group as well as a large number of other individually small acquisitions.
As with the approach for all CGUs, the Group has prepared cash flow forecasts for the Aegis Media Europe, Middle East and Africa and the Aegis Media Asia Pacific CGUs based on the most recent financial budgets.
The key assumptions on which the forecasts are based are management expectations of short term performance and long term growth rates as discussed above.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time.
They are significantly affected by a number of factors such as market growth, discount rates and currency exchange rates.
85 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 13.
The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives is 1.8m 2009: 4.9m, principally relating to trade names.
These are considered to have indefinite lives because it is the Groups intention to continue to invest in these assets and by doing so, their value will be protected and enhanced.
This continued investment involves expenditure on training, recruitment, technological development and legal protection.
All intangible assets have been subject to amortisation in the year.

The significant increase in the Groups investment in associates and share of results of associates relates predominantly to the Groups investment in Charm Communications Inc Charm, acquired in January 2010.
Charm listed on the NASDAQ exchange in May 2010, which led to a dilution of the Groups shareholding and therefore triggered a deemed disposal.
The profit on deemed disposal is included in the share of results of associates in the Group income statement.
At 31 December 2010, the Groups investment in Charm represented 18.9% of the voting power.

89 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 19.
Financial instruments The Group has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments which are discussed in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 32 to 35.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Group, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve these objectives and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Group manages its capital to enable the entities in the Group to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the Groups borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital and reserves and retained earnings.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Groups policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
Management of financial risk The Group considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Groups policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk A significant portion of the Groups activities takes place overseas.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures on transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and upon consolidation following the translation of the local currency results and net assets liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups foreign currency management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge all transactions and financial instruments with material currency exposures.
The Group is party to a number of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
These are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are taken to the income statement.
The total notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are shown below.
2010 2009 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts notional principal 367.7 242.3 It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from the translation of profits or net assets as these represent an accounting rather than cash exposure.
When it is aligned with the Groups overall funding strategy, the Groups policy is to borrow locally wherever possible to act as a natural hedge against the translation risk arising from its net investments overseas.
Where major borrowings are denominated in a currency other than sterling, the Group may enter into cross-currency swaps to reduce currency risk, as explained later in this note.
A currency analysis of borrowings is given in section c of this note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Group also seeks to manage its working capital requirement by requiring clients to pay for media in advance whenever possible.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had net debt before issue costs of new debt of 339.5m 2009: 258.6m.
The Group had cash and short term deposits of 394.4m at 31 December 2010 2009: 391.1m and gross borrowings of 733.9m 2009: 649.7m.
The Groups principal debt instruments are subject to certain financial covenants.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 90 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 19.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups unsecured loan notes, referred to above, are at fixed rates.
All other borrowings are at floating rates.
Certain portions of the Groups unsecured loan notes are subject to interest rate swaps, as explained later in this note.
The Group has in place cash pooling arrangements in a number of territories.
These enable the Group to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash balances.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet in respect of trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade credit risk is managed in each territory through the use of credit checks on new clients and individual credit limits, where considered necessary.
In some instances clients are required to pay for media in advance.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Current receivables and payables and currency disclosures Due to the nature of the operations of the business, Group companies are able to match current receivables and payables in currencies other than their functional currency and therefore do not have material, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities.
Current receivables and payables are therefore excluded from currency analyses provided in this note.
Private placement debt July 2005 On 28 July 2005, the Group issued US$342m of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2012 and 2017.
The interest rates applicable on these loan notes ranges from 5.25% to 5.65%.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
On 9 November 2005 cross currency swaps were entered into for US$142m of the loan notes due in 2012 and US$50m of the loan notes due in 2015 to convert this US$ fixed rate borrowing into Euro fixed rate borrowing.
The remaining US$150m of loan notes were used to provide a natural hedge against US dollar-denominated assets.
Private placement debt September 2007 On 17 September 2007, the Group issued US$125m of unsecured loan notes repayable between 2014 and 2017.
The interest rates applicable on these loan notes range from 6.06% to 6.29%.
Central sterling facility June 2009 The Group secured an additional sterling facility up to a value of 40m in June 2009.
The Group cancelled the facility in 2010.
Term loan July 2009 In July 2009 the Group secured a loan of 45m available until July 2011 at a variable interest rate.
In July 2011, there is a mechanism to increase the facility to 60m and accept a fixed rate dependant on the market conditions at that time or to exit the arrangement.
Private placement debt December 2009 On 17 December 2009, the Group issued US$183m and 25m of unsecured loan notes repayable between 2017 and 2019.
The interest rates applicable on these loan notes range from 6.07% to 6.50%.
On 17 November 2009, an interest rate swap was entered into for US$50m of the loan notes due 2019 to convert the USD fixed rate debt to USD floating rate debt.
On 17 November 2009, cross currency interest rate swaps were entered into for US$18m of the loan notes due in 2017 and US$115m of the loan notes due in 2019 to convert the US$ fixed rate borrowing to GBP floating rate borrowing.
From 19 January 2010, US$50m of the loan note was designated as a net investment hedge against US dollar-denominated investments.
To the extent that this hedging relationship was effective, exchange differences arising on the re-translation of the US$50m of debt was taken to reserves.
Multi-currency credit facility July 2010 In July 2010, the Group re-financed the five year 450m multi-currency credit facility with a group of international banks, which was originally entered into in June 2006.
The facility is committed and revolving and allows drawings under a variety of currencies.
Pricing is based on the inter-bank rate of the relevant currency for the corresponding period of the drawing with the interest margin determined by reference to a grid based on the consolidated net borrowings to consolidated net EBITDA ratio.
The facility is unsecured but guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries until July 2015.
91 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 19.
Financial instruments continued Convertible bond The Group issued 190.6m convertible bonds in April 2010, due for repayment in April 2015.
The convertible bonds bear interest at 2.5% per annum and are convertible at the option of the holder into Aegis ordinary shares at an exchange price of 1.6444.
The total number of ordinary shares that would be issued if all bonds converted would be 115.9 million.
As a compound financial instrument, the net proceeds of the bond were split into a liability component and an equity component on the issue date, and at 31 December 2010 the carrying value of the liability, net of deferred issue costs, is 167.4m.
Cross currency swaps The fair value of the cross currency swaps at 31 December 2010 is 13.4 m 2009: 22.1 m. The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Euro US$ foreign exchange spot rate and in Euro and US$ interest rate yields.
The cross currency swaps are synthetically split, for accounting purposes, to reflect the Groups presentational currency of Sterling.
The US$ Sterling legs of the swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges against the Groups US$ loan notes.
Movements in the fair value of the US$ Sterling legs of the swaps are taken to reserves and released to the income statement when the underlying portion of US Loan notes interest is recognised in the income statement every six months.
The Euro Sterling legs of the swaps are designated as net investment hedges in respect of certain of the Groups Euro-denominated investments.
To the extent that this hedging relationship is effective, exchange differences arising on the re-translation of the swapped Euro debt are taken to reserves.
Interest rate swaps The fair value of the interest rate swaps at 31 December 2010 is 0.5m 2009: 1.7 m. The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents unrecognised gains 2009: losses which the Group expects to realise as a result of lower or higher variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan notes.
The interest rate swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the debt caused by changes in interest rates risk.
Movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are taken to the income statement where they offset against very similar but opposite movements in the fair value of the debt caused by movements in interest rates.
Cross currency interest rate swaps The fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps at 31 December 2010 is 8.0m 2009: 1.2 m. The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Sterling US$ foreign exchange spot rate and in Sterling and US$ interest rate yields.
Movements in the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps excluding the credit spread are taken to the income statement where they offset against opposite movements in the fair value of the US$ loan notes caused by changes in interest rates and foreign exchange spot rates.
Movements in the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps relating to the credit spread are taken to reserves and released to the income statement when the underlying portion of US loan notes interest is recognised in the income statement.

Financial instruments continued b Maturity profile of Group financial assets and liabilities continued Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices includes held-to-maturity investments and quoted available-for-sale investments The fair values of derivative instruments, other than put options over acquisition of minorities, are calculated using quoted prices and yield curves derived from these quoted prices The fair values of put option liabilities are calculated as the best estimate of the gross cash expected to be paid discounted to present value.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset of liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

d Sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 1% increase in Sterling against the significant foreign currencies of the Group.
The sensitivity analysis was performed taking outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusting their translation at the period end for a 1% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans.
For a 1% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity.

The total amount of tax losses and other temporary differences for which no deferred tax was recognised at 31 December 2009 was 232.1m.
Balances in the subsidiary entities are shown on a 100% basis, regardless of ownership percentage.
Balances in associates and joint ventures are not included.
During the year, deferred tax assets totalling 8.7m were recognised in jurisdictions where tax losses have been incurred in the current period, to the extent that expected future profitability in those jurisdictions means that utilisation of these tax losses is judged to be probable.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 161.5m 2009: 97.3m relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2010 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

Acquisition of subsidiaries Mitchell Communication Group In November 2010 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Mitchell Communication Group, Australias leading marketing communication group, to enhance Aegis Medias offering in the region, particularly in digital media.
The consideration was delivered in a combination of cash and shares.
Consideration paid, excluding acquisition costs, totalled 229.1m with no deferred consideration.
The Groups newly issued ordinary shares primarily relate to the acquisition of the Mitchell Communication Group.
The shares of Aegis Group plc are listed on the London Stock Exchange and therefore the consideration is valued using the closing share price on 16 November 2010 of 1.2790.
A provisional summary of the net assets acquired and goodwill arising in respect of Mitchell Communication Group is given below: Carrying Accounting amount policy Fair value Fair value acquired alignment adjustments of net assets Net assets acquired: m m m m Intangible assets 7.1 39.7 46.8 Property, plant and equipment 4.8 4.8 Deferred tax asset 1.9 2.7 4.6 Trade and other receivables 133.6 133.6 Work in progress 0.4 0.4 Cash and cash equivalents 12.9 12.9 Trade and other payables 177.3 9.1 186.4 Deferred tax liability 1.1 13.6 14.7 Other current liabilities 11.3 11.3 Other non-current liabilities 19.6 19.6 Net assets 48.6 6.4 26.1 28.9 Goodwill capitalised in the period 258.0 Consideration 229.1 Satisfied by: Consideration paid Cash 79.9 Consideration paid Equity 116,672,515 ordinary shares in Aegis Group plc 149.2 229.1 If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for 2010 would have been 1,519.9m and Group profit before interest and tax would have been 105.7m, or 208.6m on an underlying basis.
Post acquisition revenue from Mitchell was 12.6m, with underlying profit before interest and tax of 2.0m, reduced to nil after amortisation of purchased intangibles.
Goodwill capitalised in the period represents the expected future benefits of improving the breadth of the Groups service offering and anticipated operational synergies.
No goodwill capitalised in the period is deductible for income tax purposes.
Other acquisitions excluding Mitchell Communication Group During the period, the Group acquired subsidiaries as detailed below: % Non-controlling Company Country of incorporation % Acquired interests recognised Date of acquisition Synovate SalesOut UK 51% 49% January JPA Europe UK 51% 49% November In January 2010, the Group acquired a 51% equity share in SalesOut Ltd SalesOut, a market research company incorporated in the UK, thereby obtaining control of SalesOut.
This acquisition was entered into primarily to strengthen the Groups UK operations in the retail data analysis area of the market research industry.
The acquisition was supplemented in November through the acquisition of JPA Europe, which further enhances the Groups offering in this field.
In May 2010, the Group acquired all of the trade and assets of Magic Touch, a media company incorporated in the UK.
This acquisition was entered into primarily to enhance the Groups media offering in the UK.

Post acquisition revenue and profit before interest and tax on 2010 acquisitions was 6.1m and 0.8m respectively on an underlying basis, with a statutory loss before interest and tax of 0.6m.
All noncontrolling interests are measured at the non-controlling interest share of the carrying value of net assets.
Consideration paid for acquisitions other than Mitchell Communication Group, excluding acquisition costs, totalled 3.8m with estimated deferred consideration of 0.2m payable in 2012, subject to performance criteria.
In those cases where the Group achieved control of subsidiaries for the first time, the acquisitions are not individually material to the Group and therefore the following disclosures are provided in aggregate.
A provisional summary of the net assets acquired and goodwill arising in respect of all other acquisitions made in the year excluding Mitchell Communication Group is given below: Carrying amount Fair value Fair value acquired adjustments of net assets Net assets acquired: m m m Intangible assets 0.2 5.1 5.3 Property, plant and equipment 0.1 0.1 Other assets 0.4 0.4 Trade and other receivables 0.4 0.4 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5 0.5 Trade and other payables 0.1 0.1 Other Liabilities 1.5 1.5 Deferred tax liability 1.3 1.3 Net assets 3.8 3.8 Non-controlling interest on current period acquisitions 1.8 Goodwill capitalised in the period 2.0 Consideration 4.0 Satisfied by: Consideration paid 3.8 Deferred consideration 0.2 4.0 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 104 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 26.

Such payments are either fixed under the terms of the acquisition or are contingent on future financial performance.
Deferred consideration arising on acquisitions completed prior to 1 January 2010 is presented at the Directors best estimate of the total payable.
Changes in such estimates in the current period have led to an increase in the liability of 15.9m.
Deferred consideration treated in this way is discounted at the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing.
The Directors estimate that, at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, the discounted liability at the balance sheet date for payments that may be due is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Within one year 43.7 34.4 Between one and two years 7.7 25.8 Between two and five years 12.3 9.8 Greater than five years 0.2 At 31 December 63.7 70.2 The minimum potential liability is 17.3m and the maximum potential liability is 163.5m.
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 revised, deferred consideration arising on acquisitions completed from 1 January 2010 must be recorded at fair value on acquisition, with subsequent changes now reflected in the income statement.
Deferred consideration of 0.2m arises on current year business combinations therefore this change has not had a material impact on classification or measurement for the current period.
Liabilities in respect of put options granted to NCI are disclosed as derivative liabilities.
Their expected maturities and a reconciliation of movements in the year are given in note 19.
Contingent asset As reported in prior years, during 2006 the Group became aware of a fraud perpetrated against Aegis Media Germany.
The Group has successfully recovered a portion of the monies expected to be due.
Further recoveries are anticipated in future years but the value to be received is not sufficiently certain to be recognised as an asset.

Share-based payments The Group recognised a total expense of 8.3m 2009: 7.1m in respect of all share-based payments in the year.
Share-based payments include share options and conditional share awards.
Share options The Group issues conditional share options to certain employees.
The grant price for share options is equal to the average quoted market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is typically three years.
If share options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless otherwise approved by the Remuneration Committee at their discretion, and are subject to EPS performance conditions.

Share-based payments continued Conditional share awards The Group issues conditional share awards to certain employees.
The extent to which awards vest is determined in documented scheme rules and may be based on the employees continuing employment, the Companys TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report.
The fair value of conditional share awards was determined using a stochastic model using the assumptions given in the table below.

The Group recognised a total expense of 8.3m 2009: 6.7m in respect of conditional share awards in the year.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes Retirement benefits for employees are principally provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account of 12.0m 2009: 11.9m represents contributions payable in the year to these schemes at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 31 December 2010, contributions of 3.0m 2009: 3.5m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Other retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a small number of retirement benefit schemes that do not fall under the definition of defined contribution schemes, principally where required by local statutory regulations.
The principal schemes are located in Germany, Italy, France and Norway.
Under these schemes, the Groups liabilities in respect of past service are fixed as a percentage of past salaries, but the schemes do not meet the definition of defined contribution schemes because contributions have not been paid to a separate entity.
The numbers below are in respect of all material Group defined benefit schemes, unless otherwise stated.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 31 December 2010.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

During the year, the majority of the employees in Norway were transferred to a defined contribution scheme.
