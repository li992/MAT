Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where the Group is entitled to and intends to settle tax liabilities on a net basis.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2010 2009 000 000 Deferred tax assets 3,809 3,418 Deferred tax liabilities 459 3,350 3,418 At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of 8,036,000 2009: 8,109,000 available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the underlying companies and restrictions on offset of taxable profits and losses between Group companies.
Included in unrecognised deferred tax assets are losses of 688,000 2009: 1,461,000 that will expire in 2014 and 2,286,000 2009: 1,730,000 that will expire in 2019.
Other losses will be carried forward indefinitely.
The Groups share of tax losses carried forward in the Home 3 joint venture amount to 1,070,000 2009: 790,000.
These have not been recognised since sufficient future taxable profits to offset the losses are not yet sufficiently certain in this entity.
There is no deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings.
