SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2010 86 Notes to the accounts 30 Risk Borrowing and funding risks The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 21.
At31December 2010, the Group had significant uncalled commitments of 209.8 million 2009: 371.1 million, compared to cash balances of 17.1million 2009: 144.1 million and shareholders funds of 945.7 million 2009: 620.4 million.
The Company is a closed-ended investment trust and is therefore not subject to redemption requests from its investors.
The Companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, the Companys commitments to private equity funds and other financial liabilities will be financed by available cash resources and distributions received on the realisation of underlying investments within the fund portfolio, although in the current market environment it is not anticipated that there will be significant realisations from the investment portfolio in the short term.
In addition, the Group currently has a 325.0 million loan facility, of which 302.5 million 259.2 million was undrawn at 31 December 2010, that could be drawn on, subject to financial covenants as described in note 20, to meet fund commitments as they fall due.
The Board monitors liquidity risk and, if considered appropriate, could renegotiate its lending arrangements or issue new securities.
The Groups investments are mainly illiquid but, in extremis, the Board could consider selective disposals of long-term investments, if required to meet commitments as they fall due.
In these circumstances it is possible, dependent on prevailing market conditions, that the realisation value of such assets could be at a significant discount to their previous carrying value.
A residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor to the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
A default on a fund commitment would also result in a cross-default on the Companys senior debt.
In December 2008 the Company agreed to reduce its commitment to Permira IV.
The total direct commitment by the Company to Permira IV was 2.4 billion, of which 55.5% has been called as at 31 December 2010.
The Company elected to cap its commitment at 60% of the total.
At 31 December 2010 the Company had an uncalled commitment to Permira IV of 108.3 million 2009: 166.1 million, which will only be called to finance follow-on investments and fees.
The terms of these arrangements require that future distributions from the realisation of portfolio companies receivable by those investors in Permira IV that elected to cap their commitments will be reduced by 25%, such benefit to accrue to the Limited Partners that did not elect to cap their uncalled commitments.
The Companys loan facility expires in January 2013.
The Senior Notes in issue mature between July 2013 to July 2015 see note 20.
The Convertible Bonds are repayable in 2016.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly and rigorously reviewing cash flow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Board.
Valuation market price risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 26 and 27 and a detailed analysis of the 20 largest underlying companies is given on pages 20 to 22.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 54 to 59, all underlying investments are valued at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the current International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
The IPEV Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
It should be noted that a large proportion of the Companys underlying investee companies are expected to be unquoted and therefore the valuation of such companies involves exercising judgement.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
As an indication of the valuation risk facing the Company, in 2010 the Group benefited from gains on its investment portfolio totalling 351.2 million 2009: gains of 51.3million.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Companys levels of borrowing see note 20 and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
It will also be affected by leverage in the funds in which we invest and the local currency denomination of such funds, which is considered separately under currency risk.
At 31 December 2010, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss, would result in a 13.3% 2009: 14.4% change in Shareholders funds.
Valuation risk will be affected by leverage in the underlying investee companies.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the valuations of the 20 largest underlying investee companies, which had an aggregate valuation before providing for carried interest of 1,040.0 million or 94.8% of the gross private equity fund portfolio valuation 2009: 740.2 million or 92.9%, the results of which are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical fair value fair value 10% writeFair value 10% uplift down million million million 31 December 2010 Gross valuation of 20 largest investee companies 1,040.0 1,309.6 764.9 Change in valuation effect on income 25.9% 26.5% 31 December 2009 Gross valuation of 20 largest investee companies 740.2 943.3 560.7 Change in valuation effect on income 27.4% 24.3% All investments are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Quoted companies are valued based on market prices and recently acquired unquoted investments may be carried at cost.
For such investments, a 10% movement in the valuation basis will have a 10% impact on fair value.
For unquoted investments valued on a different basis, such as earnings-related, a 10% movement in the earnings of the investee company will not necessarily result in a 10% change in fair value, because of other factors such as the level of debt utilised by the investee companies.
The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
