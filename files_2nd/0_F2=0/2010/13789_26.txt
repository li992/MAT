These impairment adjustments were calculated based on the assets value in use, using managements best estimate of future oil prices, the latest estimate of commercial reserves and a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5%.
The impairment charge on Kambuna was due to a reserves downgrade during the year caused by faster than anticipated pressure decline being observed in production data, whilst the impairment reversal on Bualuang was primarily due to a significant reserves upgrade as a result of recent drilling activities.
The Bualuang adjustment represents a full reversal of the $55,000,000 impairment charge in 2008, although the resulting credit was limited to $42,900,000 to take into consideration additional depreciation that would have been charged if the original impairment had not taken place.

82 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 25 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management The Groups Board of Directors monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through an internal risk register.
These include commodity, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.
Commodity price risk The Groups policy is to consider oil and gas price hedging when and where it is economically attractive to lock in prices at levels that protect the cash flow of the Salamander Group, its business plan and debt related coverage ratios.
All hedging transactions to date have been related directly to expected cash flows and no speculative transactions have been undertaken.
For 2010, the Groups oil production was all sold at prices relative to the spot market.
2010 production was hedged with zero cost collars of 2,500 bopd with a put and call price of $60.00 and $78.00 and additional zero cost collars of 1,500 bopd with a put and call price of $60.00 and $90.00, purchased respectively in May and July 2009 and which all expired during 2010.
During November 2010 the Group purchased puts for calendar year 2011 for 4,000 bopd with a price of $60.00.
During 2010, 76% of the Groups gas production its Indonesian gas production was sold at fixed prices under long term contracts with the balance its Thai gas production sold at prices based on a formula related to spot medium sulphur fuel oil prices.
The Group held no hedges with respect to its gas production during 2010.
The key variable which affects the fair value of the Groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity on hedging mark to markets values to net income and equity to a twenty per cent increase and a twenty per cent decrease in this variable: Increase decrease to mark to market value 2010 2009 Oil Oil $000s $000s Twenty per cent increase 256 24,144 Twenty per cent decrease 1,165 1,131 Foreign exchange risk The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed through maintaining the majority of the Groups cash and cash equivalent balances in US Dollars, the Groups presentational currency and the functional currency of all its subsidiaries.
The Group also holds, from time to time, cash balances in UK Pounds Sterling and other currencies to meet short-term commitments in those currencies.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2010 2009 2010 2009 $000s $000s $000s $000s UK Pounds Sterling 2,316 935 2,469 1,149 Singapore Dollar 5,888 318 114 52 Indonesian Rupiah 26,434 15,174 3,597 1,131 Thailand Baht 33,332 13,148 70,790 5,783 Vietnamese Dong 1,094 874 458 611 Other 26 31 13 2 83 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 20% increase or decrease in the US Dollar against the relevant foreign currency.

The Group is exposed to the following credit and counterparty risks.
In respect of cash and cash equivalents, the Groups principal financial asset, the credit risk is deemed limited because the majority of the cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks with AA or A credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In respect of the Groups trade sales, the Group manages credit risk through dealing with, whenever possible, either international energy companies or state owned companies based in Thailand and Indonesia and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate.
The Group consistently monitors counterparty credit risk.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end without taking account of any collateral obtained.
In addition, the Groups operations are typically structured via contractual joint venture arrangements.
As such the Group is reliant on joint venture partners to fund their capital or other funding obligations in relation to assets and operations which are not yet cash generative.
The Group closely monitors the risks and maintains a close dialogue with those counterparties considered to be highest risk in this regard.
84 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 25 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, and borrowing facilities to meet its forecast short, medium and long-term commitments.
The Group continually monitors its actual and forecast cash flows to ensure that there are adequate reserves and banking facilities to meet the maturing profiles of its financial assets and liabilities.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturities for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date the Group was required to pay at the Balance Sheet date.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the Groups exposure to an interest rate movement and is prepared assuming the amount of the net debt and interest rate swaps outstanding at the Balance Sheet date were outstanding for the whole year.
85 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk continued For net debt, if interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 would have increased or decreased by $0.9 million 2009: $1.3 million.
This is principally attributable to the Group maintaining a higher cash and cash equivalents position as described in note 20.
For interest rate swaps, if interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 would have decreased or increased by $0.8 million and $0.3 million respectively 2009: decreased or increased by $1.3 million and $1.8 million respectively.
Fair value of financial instruments Fair value of financial instruments carries at amortised cost The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values.
Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices includes listed redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and perpetual notes.
The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the Groups fair value financial assets and liabilities are deemed to be Level 2.
There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the year 2009: Nil.

Further details of the PSP are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Awards under the PSP may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, or the transfer of shares from the Companys treasury or shares purchased in the market.
In any ten year period, the Company may not issue or have the possibility to issue more than 10% of the issued capital of the Company pursuant to awards granted under the PSP and any other rights granted under any other employee share plan adopted by the Company.
Shares held in treasury will count as new issue shares for the purposes of the above limits unless institutional bodies decide that they need not count.
Shares purchased in the market will not, however, count towards the limit described above.
Movement in PSP shares during the year was as follows: 2010 2009 Shares under Weighted Shares under Weighted option average price option average price Number s Number s Outstanding at 1 January 3,860,196 0.10 2,489,785 0.10 Granted during the year 1,329,621 0.10 1,994,754 0.10 Exercised during the year 441,391 0.10 Lapsed during the year 541,946 Forfeited during the year 82,397 Outstanding at 31 December 4,748,426 0.10 3,860,196 0.10 Exercisable at 31 December 269,678 87 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Share option schemes and Share Based Payment continued The expense recognised for unvested employee share options of $2,565,447 2009: $3,433,649 relates wholly to equity-settled Share Based Payment arising from grants made under the PSP.
At 31 December 2010, the total future expense relating to unvested awards not yet recognised was $1,384,955, which is expected to be recognised over the following 3 years.
The weighted average exercise price for options that were forfeited during the year was 0.10.
The weighted average market price of shares at the date of exercise was 2.53.
Outstanding share options at 31 December 2010 will vest between 2011 and 2013 subject to the vesting criteria.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year, as estimated at the date of grant, was 1.67 per share 2009: 0.89.
This was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model based on the following assumptions: 2010 2009 Weighted average share price at date of grant 2.36 1.29 Exercise price 0.10 0.10 Expected volatility 68% 63% Expected life 3 years 3 years Expected dividend 0% 0% Risk-free interest rate 1.83% 1.93% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the comparator groups share price, over a period equal to the expected life of the options.
The median of the constituents of the comparator group which had a three year history was used to determine the estimate for the Company volatility.
The mean average of all the constituents of the comparator group including those with only a short listing history was 67% 2009: 54%.
The average comparator group correlation was 21% 2009: 22%.
There is a 12 month window for exercise.
However, as the exercise price is nominal it is assumed that recipients exercise at the end of the performance period.
Therefore an expected life of three years after the date of grant has been assumed.
During 2010, following approval at the 2009 AGM, the Company implemented a new equity settled share option scheme for employees called the Salamander Energy Deferred Equity Plan DEP.
The DEP follows a similar principle to the PSP scheme, but removes the requirement of a comparator group with shares settled after a period of two years by the issue of new shares, or the transfer of shares from the Companys treasury or shares purchased in the market.
The weighted average share price at date of grant was 2.62 with an exercise price of 0.10 and an expected life of two years.
The charge for the DEP during the year was $213,775.
29 Dividends The Company has declared no dividend for the year 2009: nil.
