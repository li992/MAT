The Company has surplus expenses carried forward of 133.3 million 2009 125.6 million.
Given the Companys current investment strategy, it is unlikely to generate sufficient UK taxable profits to relieve these expenses.
As at 31 January 2010 there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset measured of 37.3 million 2009 35.1 million.
This unrecognised deferred tax asset relates to the current and prior year unutilised expenses.
It is considered unlikely that there will be a liability in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
Therefore the asset has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions to obtain approval in the foreseable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposal of investments.
