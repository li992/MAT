29 CONtINGeNt LIABILItIeS In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading OFT issued a Statement of Objections to a number of grocery retailers and milk producers, alleging collusion in the setting of prices for certain dairy products in 2002 and 2003.
The Board strongly believes that Morrisons has no case to answer and have made representations in detail to this effect.
Our view is unchanged by the Supplementary Statement of Objections issued by the OFT in July 2009.
The Board does not consider it probable that the Company will ultimately incur a fine and, accordingly, has made no provision for such liability.
The OFT also continues to investigate the market for the sale of tobacco, and in this case, there is a complex legal question as to whether well established industry practices represented a breach of competition law.
It is likely that this can only be settled through a formal judicial process.
The Board has not made a provision for such a liability.
