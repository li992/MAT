Changes in accounting policies Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2010 With effect from 1 January 2010, the Group early adopted Improvements to IFRSs 2010 which makes minor amendments to seven existing standards.
These amendments impact disclosures and, therefore, have had no impact on the reported results or financial position of the Group.
The amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, allows the presentation either in the statement of changes in equity, or within the notes, of an analysis of the components of other comprehensive income by item.
With effect from 1 January 2010, the Group adopted the following amendments to existing standards: IFRS 3, Business Combinations, introduces changes in the accounting treatment of acquisitions, such as the accounting for acquisition-related costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of contingent consideration, and business combinations achieved in stages.
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively and has not had a material impact on reported results.
The impact on future years will depend on the specific acquisitions undertaken: and Amendment to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, requires that acquisitions of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with equity holders and, therefore, no goodwill is recognised as a result.
In addition, the Group has reviewed the effect of the following amendments and interpretations effective from 1 January 2010, and has concluded that they have no impact on the Groups accounts: Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items: Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment: Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions: Improvements to IFRSs 2009: International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: and IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers.
Amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The Group has reviewed the effect of the following EU-endorsed amendments and interpretations, and does not expect that they will have an impact on the Group's accounts: Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation: Classification of Rights Issues, effective on or after 1 February 2010: IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments, effective on or after 1 July 2010: IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures, effective on or after 1 January 2011: and Amendment to IFRIC 14, IAS 19, The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, effective on or after 1 January 2011.
Segmental analysis The Group reports on five operating groups which are organised around a combination of the different products and services they provide, and the geographical areas in which they operate: BAE Systems, Inc. : Electronics, Intelligence & Support, based primarily in the US, provides a wide range of electronic systems and subsystems for military and commercial applications, technical and professional services for US national security and federal markets, and ship repair and modernisation services.
It comprises four businesses: Electronic Solutions, Intelligence & Security, Platform Solutions and Support Solutions: Land & Armaments, based primarily in the US, designs, develops, produces, supports and upgrades armoured combat vehicles, tactical wheeled vehicles, naval guns, missile launchers, artillery systems, munitions and law enforcement products: Programmes & Support primarily comprises the Groups UK-based air, maritime and Cyber & Intelligence activities: International comprises the Groups businesses in Australia, India and Saudi Arabia, together with interests in the pan-European MBDA joint venture and Air Astana: and HQ & Other Businesses comprises the regional aircraft asset management and support activities, head office and UK shared services activity, including research centres and property management.
The Group has not aggregated any segments in arriving at the analysis.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2010 2009 m m Deductible temporary differences 3 10 Capital losses carried forward 56 58 Trading and other losses carried forward 194 158 253 226 These assets have not been recognised as the incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be sufficiently accurately predicted at this time.
Due to changes in UK tax legislation during 2009, there are no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on the aggregate temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures 2009 nil.
Any withholding tax due on the remittance of future earnings is expected to be insignificant.
Tax continued Future changes in tax rates The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK current tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011.
This will reduce future current tax charges accordingly.
The first reduction from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted before 31 December 2010 and will be effective from 1 April 2011.
Accordingly, both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2010 have been calculated at 27%.
The reduction in the rate from 27% to 24% has not yet been substantively enacted.
If these reductions had been substantively enacted by 31 December 2010, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2010 from 1,154m to 1,065m.
Of this reduction, it is estimated that 19m would have been charged to the consolidated income statement and 70m charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, unrecognised deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2010 would have reduced from 253m to 235m.
Disposals Discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2010 On 3 June 2010, the Group sold half of its 20.5% shareholding in Saab AB to Investor AB for a cash consideration of SEK1,041m 92m.
Following the loss of significant influence over the company, the Group has discontinued the use of the equity method and the remaining shareholding in Saab is shown within other financial assets as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2010 see note 17.
The Groups share of the results of Saab to the date of disposal is shown within discontinued operations for the current and prior periods.
The results from discontinued operations which have been included in the consolidated income statement are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Share of results of equity accounted investments 2 16 Profit on disposal of discontinued operations 52 Profit for the year discontinued operations 54 16 The profit on disposal of discontinued operations is calculated as follows: m Cash consideration 92 Fair value of retained 10.25% investment 97 Transaction costs 3 Carrying value of 20.5% shareholding note 14 155 Cumulative net hedging gain 4 Cumulative currency translation gain 17 Profit on disposal of discontinued operations 52 Following the classification of Saab as a discontinued operation, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments in the comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been reduced by 425m.
Continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2010 During 2010, the Group completed the disposal of its Sistemas y Desarrollos Funcionales Limitada SISDEF joint venture for total cash consideration of 1m.
Continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2009 Profit on disposal of businesses of 68m comprised the finalisation of the accounting gain recognised in 2008 on the disposal of the Groups interests in the businesses contributed to the BVT joint venture following acquisition of VT Groups 45% interest in 2009 58m and additional proceeds received in respect of the disposal in 2008 of the Groups interest in Flagship Training 10m.
The Group received deferred consideration of 72m in the year ended 31 December 2009 in respect of the disposals of Flagship Training Limited in 2008 70m and the Inertial Products business in 2007 2m.

The directors consider that this gives a more appropriate indication of underlying performance.
In the 12 months to 31 December 2009, outstanding share options were anti-dilutive and so were excluded from the diluted loss per share in accordance with IAS 33.

7 Amortisation is included in operating costs in the income statement.
The 2010 charge for programme and customer related intangibles includes an acceleration of amortisation 137m reflecting the profile of vehicle deliveries under the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles contract.
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
The Groups approach to goodwill impairment testing is set out in the accounting policies on page 132.
Impairment testing In order to calculate the recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill, all goodwill balances have been considered with regard to value in use calculations.
These calculations use risk-adjusted future cash flow projections based on the Groups five-year BAE Systems Annual Report 2010 149 Financial statements Governance Segmental performance Group performance Strategy Overview Notes to the Group accounts continued 11.
Intangible assets continued Integrated Business Plan IBP and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with an inflationary growth rate assumption applied.
The IBP process uses historic experience, available government spending data and the Groups order book.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.28% 2009 7.72% adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the cash-generating unit CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash flows.
Significant CGUs 2010 The Group has two CGUs with allocated goodwill which is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill, the Electronic Solutions business 2.0bn within Electronics, Intelligence & Support EI&S, and the Land & Armaments business 3.6bn.
The key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections are, for Electronic Solutions, continuing demand from the US government for electronic warfare systems where the business has a leadership position and other technology-based solutions, and for Land & Armaments, the continued demand in the Groups home markets and from exports for existing and successor military land and tracked vehicles, upgrade programmes and support.
The pre-tax discount rates used to discount the risk-adjusted five-year cash flow projections were 9.1% and 9.0%, respectively.
The growth rate assumption applied to the final year of these projections was 3%.
2009 The Group had three CGUs with allocated goodwill which was significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
These were the US-based electronic warfare, network and mission solutions business in the EI&S operating group 2.6bn, and the US-based ex-United Defense Industries, Inc. UDI 2.0bn and ex-Armor Holdings, Inc. Armor 1.7bn preimpairment below businesses in the Land & Armaments operating group.
The key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections were, for the EI&S CGU, the continuing demand from the US government for electronic warfare systems, mission solutions and other technology-based solutions, and from non-military agencies for network solutions, and for the Land & Armaments CGUs, the continued demand in the Groups home markets and from exports for existing and successor military land and tracked vehicles, upgrade programmes and support.
The pre-tax discount rates used to discount the risk-adjusted five-year cash flow projections were 9.9%, 9.8% and 10.3%, respectively.
The growth rate assumption applied to the final year of these projections was 3% 2% for Armor.
Whilst there are no other CGUs with allocated goodwill balances exceeding 15% of the Groups total goodwill balance, the majority of the projected cash flows within the remaining CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of government spending on defence and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
The directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes relating either specifically to the global military vehicle market, or to the levels of defence and security spending in the Groups home markets, particularly in the US, that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Group continues to monitor changes in US defence budgets on an annual basis.
Impairment goodwill 2010 The total goodwill impairment charge of 84m mainly arose in Surface Ships 70m reflecting the underperformance of the ex-VT Group export ship contracts.
The pre-tax discount rate was 10.4%.
2009 The total goodwill impairment charge of 725m mainly arose in three CGUs, Armor 526m, Products Group 156m and Detica 34m.
The Armor impairment charge reflected both the non-award of a follow-on contract for production of vehicles under the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles FMTV programme and the subsequent impact on the growth prospects of the business.
The Products Group impairment charge reflected a weaker outlook for the business as spending from customer discretionary budgets had reduced in both domestic and export markets.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 9.5%.
The Detica impairment charge related to the discontinued financial services element of the business.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 10.0%.
Impairment intangible assets 2010 The total intangible assets impairment charge of 41m comprises 30m relating to programme and customer related intangibles, and 11m relating to other intangibles.
The charge impacted the EI&S 8m, Land & Armaments 25m and Programmes & Support 8m operating groups.
2009 The total intangible assets impairment charge of 248m comprised 240m relating to programme and customer related intangibles, and 8m relating to other intangibles.
The charge impacted the EI&S 8m, Land & Armaments 236m and International 4m operating groups.
Intangible assets continued The charge relating to Land & Armaments included 108m in respect of the Products Group business, 66m relating to the FMTV non-award and a number of individually small items each calculated on a  basis.

Retirement benefit obligations Pension plans BAE Systems plc operates pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal plans in the UK and US are funded defined benefit plans, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans in other countries are defined contribution plans.
Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries as updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 to assess the deficits of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2010.
These plans were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2010.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans are: UK US 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 % % % % % % Discount rate 5.5 5.7 6.3 5.5 5.9 6.5 Inflation rate 3.4 3.5 2.9 3.0 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 4.4 4.5 3.9 4.5 4.5 5.5 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.3 3.6 2.3 3.7 2.2 3.4 1 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.8 3.4 3.5 2.9 Long-term healthcare cost increases 5.3 5.3 5.3 1 The assumption for the rate of deferred pension increases of 2.8% is in respect of those schemes which refer to the Consumer Prices Index as the relevant measure.
The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid values of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present values of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and therefore inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below.
Discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information.
The inflation assumptions are used to derive the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2010, continued to use PA 00 medium cohort tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members.
In addition, this mortality has been subject to a minimum assumed rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1%.
For its US pension arrangements, the mortality tables used are RP 2000 projected to 2018 for pensioners and projected to 2025 for non-pensioners.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK and US plans range from 19 to 23 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 21 to 26 years for current female pensioners at age 65.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 8.0% in 2011 reducing to 5% by 2017 for pre-retirement and 8.5% in 2011 reducing to 5% by 2018 for post-retirement.
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown below.
The full disclosures, as required by IAS 19, are provided in the subsequent information.

With the exception of the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan, this change has affected all of the Groups UK pension schemes for deferred pension increases, but has only affected two of the Groups smaller schemes for increases to pensions in payment.
BAE Systems Annual Report 2010 161 Financial statements Governance Segmental performance Group performance Strategy Overview Notes to the Group accounts continued 21.
Retirement benefit obligations continued During the year, the Group contributed an additional 25m into Trust for the benefit of the Groups main pension scheme 2009 225m.
The cumulative contributions totalling 250m are reported within other investments 260m after cumulative fair value gains of 11m and cash and cash equivalents 1m at 31 December 2010, and the use of these assets is restricted under the terms of the Trust.
The Group considers these contributions to be equivalent to the other lump sum contributions it makes into the Groups pension schemes and, accordingly, presents below a definition of the pension deficit including them.

Certain of the Groups equity accounted investments participate in the Groups defined benefit plans as well as Airbus SAS, the Groups share of which was disposed of during 2006.
As these plans are multi-employer plans the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and to Airbus SAS based upon a reasonable and consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.
When setting the overall expected rate of return on plan assets, historical markets are studied, and long-term historical relationships between equities and bonds are preserved.
This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

This includes contributions of 157m into the UK schemes relating to the 500m share buyback programme completed in July 2010 and 51m into the 2000 Plan following the triennial actuarial valuation of that scheme.
In 2011, the Group expects to make regular contributions at a similar level to those made in 2010.
The Group incurred a charge in respect of the cash contributions of 110m 2009 127m paid to defined contribution plans for employees.
It expects to make contributions of 108m to these plans in 2011.

Provisions continued Aircraft financing The provision includes probable exposures under residual value guarantees issued by the Group on previous sales transactions.
The Group has provided residual value guarantees in respect of certain commercial aircraft sold.
At 31 December 2010, the Groups gross exposure to make future payments in respect of these arrangements was 33m 2009 48m.
The Groups net exposure to these guarantees is covered by the provisions held of 18m 2009 32m and the residual values of the related aircraft of 18m 2009 12m.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
Such costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery.
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum but not the timing of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels.
Reorganisations continuing operations The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Such costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions.
The reorganisation provisions totalling 204m created in 2010 include 60m for which the Group is contractually entitled to reimbursement from the customer.
This amount is included in prepayments and accrued income at 31 December 2010 see note 16.
Legal, contractual and environmental provisions The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the timing and amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided.
There are no individually significant amounts included in the legal, contractual and environmental provisions created in 2010 totalling 164m.
Other provisions There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.
Contingent liabilities and commitments Guarantees and performance bonds The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business.
Provision is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.
Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessee The Group leases various offices, factories, shipyards and aircraft under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms including escalation clauses, renewal rights and purchase options.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases and associated future minimum sublease income are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Payments due: Not later than one year 222 180 Later than one year and not later than five years 608 571 Later than five years 670 704 1,500 1,455 Total of future minimum sublease income under non-cancellable subleases 254 286 Capital commitments Capital expenditure contracted for but not provided for in the accounts is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Property, plant and equipment 103 126 Intangible assets 4 7 107 133 166 www.

Certain provisions of the Companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These provisions include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting interest in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive Chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
Treasury shares During the year, 143,951,447 ordinary shares of 2.5p each were repurchased under the buyback programme completed in July 2010.
During 2010, 9,526,179 treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options under the Share Incentive Plan and the Share Matching Plan 2009 11,086,593 to satisfy awards and options under the Share Incentive Plan and the Save-As-You-Earn Share Option Scheme.
Own shares held Own shares held, including treasury shares and shares held by BAE Systems ESOP Trust, are recognised as a deduction from retained earnings.
BAE Systems ESOP Trust The Group has an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire Company shares, using funds loaned by the Group, to meet commitments to Group employees.
A dividend waiver was in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those owned beneficially by the participants, for the dividends paid in June and November 2010.
The shares held by the ESOP are recorded at cost and deducted from retained earnings until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
A dividend waiver was in operation during 2010 and remains over shares within the Companys Share Incentive Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by the participants.
A dividend waiver was also in operation for the dividends paid in June and November 2010 over shares in the Group All-Employee Free Shares Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by participants.
Capital The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings.
At 31 December 2010, the Groups capital was 5,356m 2009 4,550m, which comprises total equity of 5,403m 2009 4,663m, less amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of 47m 2009 113m.
Net debt as defined by the Group was 242m 2009 net cash 403m.
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors of an appropriate balance of funding required.
The Groups policy is to maintain an investment grade credit rating.
The Groups dividend policy is to grow the dividend whilst maintaining a long-term sustainable earnings cover of approximately two times.

Acquisition of subsidiaries Acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2010 In 2010, the Group acquired Atlantic Marine Holding Company Atlantic Marine and OASYS Technology, LLC OASYS.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2010, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments would have been 22.5bn, revenue 21.2bn and profit 1,022m from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2010.
For all acquisitions made in the year, fair values remain provisional, but will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition.

Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Atlantic Marine On 13 July 2010, the Group completed the acquisition of Atlantic Marine, a naval services and marine fabrication business, for $372m headline price of $352m, plus purchase price adjustments of $20m 245m.
The business employs approximately 1,500 people at Mayport and Jacksonville, Florida, Moss Point, Mississippi, and Mobile, Alabama.
The acquisition complements BAE Systems existing ship repair and upgrade capabilities serving the US Navy.
The Group anticipates continued strong demand for naval support capabilities in the US and the acquisition is consistent with BAE Systems strategy to address anticipated growth in Services activity in its home markets.
Atlantic Marine operates two facilities in Jacksonville and Mobile, both of which are situated in deep water ports along some of the busiest trade routes in the US.
Additionally, Atlantic Marine operates a facility located on the Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville, the second largest homeport of US Navy surface combatants on the East and Gulf Coasts, and proposed as the new homeport for an aircraft carrier in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review.
These opportunities do not translate into separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within Atlantic Marine supporting the recognised goodwill.
The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The Atlantic Marine acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Accounting policy Fair value alignments adjustments Book value Fair value m m m m Intangible assets 1 36 37 Property, plant and equipment 94 1 20 113 Inventories 1 1 Receivables 15 1 14 Deferred tax assets 1 1 Payables 13 1 1 15 Deferred tax liabilities 23 18 41 Provisions 14 2 16 Cash and cash equivalents 18 18 Net assets liabilities acquired 79 2 35 112 Goodwill 133 Consideration cash 245 The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of 5m related to external legal fees and due diligence costs.
These costs have been included in operating costs.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Atlantic Marine of 37m primarily relate to customer relationships.
Receivables include trade receivables with a fair value and gross contractual value of 13m, which are expected to be fully recoverable.
OASYS On 19 October 2010, the Group completed the acquisition of OASYS, a US manufacturer of electro-optical systems and sub-assemblies based in Manchester, New Hampshire, for cash consideration of $24m 15m and a potential earn-out of up to $29m 18m.
The fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date is $29m 18m.
Payment of the contingent consideration is dependent on the business achieving certain revenue targets for 2010 and 2011.
The net assets and goodwill included in the consolidated balance sheet as a result of this acquisition are 5m and 28m, respectively.
The acquisition of OASYS complements the existing Electronic Solutions business in the US and enhances the Groups product offerings in growing electro-optical markets.
These opportunities do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within OASYS supporting the recognised goodwill.
Adjustments to goodwill in respect of prior year acquisitions Tenix Defence Holdings Pty Limited Tenix Defence Outstanding issues concerning the acquisition of the Tenix Defence business in 2008, including the completion accounting process, have been resolved successfully with agreement of contingent payments totalling A$127.5m 74m, net of legal fees from the former owners of the business.
In September 2010, the Group received a payment of A$112.5m 65m, net of legal fees with the remainder due in 2011.
These payments reduce purchase consideration and, therefore, the amount of goodwill arising on consolidation is reduced by 64m 74m, less 10m deferred tax from 323m to 259m.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2009 The most significant acquisition made by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2009 was of the 45% shareholding in BVT Surface Fleet Limited BVT held by VT Group plc VT.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2009, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments, revenue and loss for the year ended 31 December 2009 from continuing operations would have been 22.4bn, 21.3bn and 74m, respectively.
BVT now BAE Systems Surface Ships On 30 October 2009, the BVT joint venture became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group after VT Group plc exercised its option to sell its 45% shareholding in BVT to BAE Systems.
Consideration paid including transaction costs for the remaining 45% interest was 348m.
The now wholly-owned company has been renamed BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited Surface Ships.
The Group previously held a 55% interest in BVT, and accounted for its share of the results and net assets of BVT in accordance with IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures.
Total goodwill arising amounted to 584m, which comprised 225m on the initial formation of the BVT joint venture in the year ended 31 December 2008 and 359m arising on the acquisition of the 45% interest.
A final update of the fair values arising on acquisition has been undertaken, with the main adjustment being for additional losses identified on the export ship contracts amounting to 163m.
The losses have arisen due to circumstances in existence prior to 1 July 2008, but those losses have only been identified in the current year.
Goodwill has increased by 53m to 637m primarily reflecting 45% of the post-tax losses.
In accordance with IFRS 3 2004, the portion of these losses relating to the Group's original 55% interest in the joint venture has been reflected in the revaluation reserve 64m, leaving a cumulative credit on that reserve of 10m.
Comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been restated accordingly.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2009, Surface Ships contributed revenue and profit after tax of 338m and 34m, respectively, to the Groups consolidated results as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The acquisition of BVT has had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.

The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.
Financial risk management continued The following table compares the estimated fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities to their carrying values at the 1 balance sheet date.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Beyond 2011 2012 2013 2014 2014 m m m m m Assets Current Cash and cash equivalents 2,813 Liabilities Non-current Loans 737 737 711 639 Current Loans and overdrafts 311 Collateral As shown above, the Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge certain long-term foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent on the market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2010 totalled nil 2009 11m.
Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and deposits through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon by utilising derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Groups current interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2009 50% and a maximum of 75% 2009 75% of gross debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had 65% 2009 62% of fixed rate debt and 35% 2009 38% of floating rate debt based on a gross debt of 3.0bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets 2009 3.3bn.
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2010, the Group had a total of $1.5bn 2009 $1.9bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 4.6 years 2009 4.2 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 5.7 years 2009 6.4 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 3.3% 2009 3.4%, 2.7% on US dollars and 1.8% on sterling 2009 3.0% on US dollars and 2.3% on sterling.
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 6.5% 2009 6.3%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 12m 2009 12m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 16m 2009 17m.
Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by each line of business as part of the annual Integrated Business Planning process and as part of the monthly reporting cycle.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Surplus cash held by the operating groups over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the line of business cash forecasts.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 2bn 2009 1.455bn.
The RCF is contracted until 2015, and was undrawn throughout the year.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial instruments.
However, the Group has policies in place to ensure credit risk is limited by placing concentration limits.
The Group has a credit limit system to manage actively its exposure to treasury counterparties.
The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2010 of 2,813m 2009 3,693m was invested with 24 2009 26 financial institutions.
The system assigns a maximum exposure based on the counterpartys size, a composite credit rating and credit default swap price.
These limits are regularly monitored and updated.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid such as short-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to credit risk through this process.
The Group has material receivables due from the UK and US governments where credit risk is not considered to be an issue.

Currency risk In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to volatility in earnings and cash flows as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most significant being the US dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
To mitigate this risk, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures, unless otherwise approved as an exception by the Treasury Review Management Committee, as well as to manage anticipated economic cash flows over the medium term.
The Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material transactional foreign currency exposures.
The Group is also exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement or balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
Hedges are, however, undertaken in respect of investments that are not considered long term or core to the Group.
Related party transactions The Group has a related party relationship with its directors and key management as disclosed in the Remuneration report on pages 96 to 119 and in note 7, its equity accounted investments note 14 and the pension plans note 21.
Transactions occur with the equity accounted investments in the normal course of business, are priced on an arms-length basis and settled on normal trade terms.
