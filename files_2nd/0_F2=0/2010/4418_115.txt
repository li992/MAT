102 Kesa Electricals plc | Annual report 2009 10 SECTION 4 Financial statements and notes 1 accounting policies continued Retirement benefits In accordance with FRS 17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the Comet Pension Scheme on a defined contribution scheme basis.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cover the Company and a number of its subsidiaries and cannot be split between each subsidiary on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Company has therefore taken advantage of the multi-employer exemption allowed by paragraph 9 b of FRS 17.
The pension rights of the Company are dealt with through a self-administered scheme, the assets of which are held independently of the Companys finances.
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme that is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the Company and its subsidiaries at rates advised by independent professional qualified actuaries.
Disclosure relating to the Comet Pension Scheme is included in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.
taxation Current tax represents the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or asset has arisen as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance sheet date and have given rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or the right to pay less tax in the future.
An asset has not been recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
Provision is made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the distribution to the UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where dividends have been recognised as receivable.
