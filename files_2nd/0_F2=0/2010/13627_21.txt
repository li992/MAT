Going concern The Company has considerable financial resources together with a significant order book, with customers across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus the going concern basis is adopted in preparing the annual financial statements.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2010.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the values were determined.
Group Business Review Governance Financial Statements Information ROTORK P. L. C. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 51 1.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies continued Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the contracted shipping terms.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition, including acquisition costs and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is allocated to cash-generating units CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets i Research & development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of five years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles acquired.
The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired so far range from one year for order backlog at acquisition to 15 years for long-standing customer relationships.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
52 ROTORK P. L. C. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less than 50 years.
Other assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 10% to 33% Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.
Taxation Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, on a first in, first out basis, and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term with an original maturity less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Equity Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Provisions A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.

Accounting policies continued Employee benefits i Pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to these schemes in accordance with qualified actuaries recommendations.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of the plan are recognised in equity.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses and the expected return on scheme assets within financing income in the consolidated income statement.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payment transactions The Rotork Share Option Scheme allows certain employees to acquire shares in Rotork p. l. c. This scheme is now closed and the last grant of new options took place in 2004.
Details of the scheme are given in note 24.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork p. l. c. at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant.
The fair value of the right option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity.
The right option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled.
The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted.
The Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers.
These awards may vest after a period of three years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met.
Details of the grants are given in note 24.
This plan gives either share or cash awards of equivalent value to the share awards dependent upon the employees country of residence at date of grant.
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award and a provision within employee benefits for the cash settled award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of non-market performance conditions not being met.
In the case of the cash awards, the liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, spread equally over the vesting period.
iii Long-term service leave The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv Other employee benefits In addition to the above schemes the Group offers a number of discretionary bonus schemes to employees around the world.
The costs of these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
This includes the Share Incentive Plan and Overseas Profit Linked Share Scheme both of which are a known liability at the year end.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
These are the only form of derivative financial instruments used by the Group.
In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
However, forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.

Accounting policies continued Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
i Impairment of goodwill Determining whether Goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of CGUs to which Goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 11. ii Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values.
These include future mortality, discount rate inflation and salary increases.
Management makes these judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 23.

Acquisitions 2010 On 19 May 2010 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ralph A. Hiller Company Inc. Hiller for 5,453,000.
Hiller is a designer and manufacturer of nuclear actuators and a distributor of related products based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.
The acquired business will be integrated into the Fluid Systems division.
In the eight months to 31 December 2010 Hiller contributed 6,643,000 to Group revenue and 837,000 to consolidated operating profit before the 390,000 amortisation charge from the acquired intangible assets.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2010 the business would have contributed 10,249,000 to Group revenue and 942,000 to Group operating profit.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders as the Group manages its treasury function on a Group basis.
Goodwill has arisen on this acquisition as a result of the value attributed to staff expertise and the assembled workforce, which did not meet the recognition criteria for an intangible asset.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.

The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be slightly higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork p. l. c. controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
It is not practical to quantify the unprovided temporary differences as acknowledged within paragraph 40 of IAS 12.

Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to business segment.

These calculations use cash flow projections and are based on actual operating results and the latest Group three year plan.
The three year plan is based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
Cash flows for the remainder of the next twenty years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which reflects the longterm nature of many of the markets the Group serves.
This rate has been consistently bettered in the past so it is believed to represent a prudent estimate.
The discount rate used is 12.1% 2009: 9.8%, this represents a reasonable rate for a market participant in this sector.
The discount rate of each business segment is not materially different to 12.1%.
For the Goodwill to become impaired in the CGU with the minimum headroom, the discount rate would have to increase by 24%.
On this basis each business segment has sufficient headroom and therefore no impairment write downs are required.

a Share option scheme At 1 January 1995 the Group established a share option programme for employees.
The allocation of options was linked to the completion of five years service.
In accordance with the programme, once vested the options grant the right to purchase shares at the market price they were at the date of grant.
Exercise prices range from 2.78 to 3.87.
Options vest after three years and expire ten years after being granted.
Only the 2004 grant occurred after 7 November 2002, the start date for recognition under IFRS 2.
Therefore only charges in respect of these grants have been made to the accounts in accordance with IFRS 2 and the relevant disclosures made below.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to the 2000 and 2001 grants in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.

c Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is a performance share or cash unit plan under which shares or cash units are conditionally allocated to selected members of senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the Companys AGM on 18 May 2000, awards over shares were made to executive directors and senior managers in each year from 2000 to 2009.
In 2009 and 2010 awards were only made under the share-based scheme.
2007-2009 LTIPs No shares or cash units will normally be released to participants unless they are still in the Groups service following completion of three year performance periods and the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of companies places it in at least the 50th percentile position in the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 30% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.8% to the vesting percentage.
The Companys earnings per share EPS is also monitored during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum.
Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
The performance period for the 2007 awards ended on 31 December 2009.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of this award as the Companys position relative to the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period was above the 75th percentile and the Groups earnings per share growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum.
The performance period for the 2008 awards ended on 31 December 2010.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 94.4% vesting of these awards based on the performance criteria of the scheme.
The awards will vest during 2011.
2010 LTIP plan Following shareholder approval of the 2010 LTIP plan at the Companys AGM on 23 April 2010, awards of shares were made to executive and senior managers.
Half of these awards vest under a TSR performance condition and half under an EPS performance condition.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 25% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
The EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is RPI 10% over the vesting period up to a maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI 25%.

Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The Treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit risk, foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 70% to 80% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance.
As well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing, liquidity of funds and interest rate.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 Trade receivables 70,362 53,791 Other receivables 7,974 7,316 Cash and cash equivalents 97,881 78,676 Currency swap deposit 400 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging: Assets 918 942 177,135 141,125 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 Sterling 5,107 6,179 US dollar 14,183 13,134 Euro 37,730 25,604 Other 13,342 8,874 70,362 53,791 Group Business Review Governance Financial Statements Information ROTORK P.

Financial instruments continued a Credit Risk continued Provisions against trade receivables The aging of trade receivables and associated provision for impairment at the reporting date was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2010 2010 2009 2009 Not past due 49,870 88 36,923 41 Past due 1-30 days 11,503 89 9,438 49 Past due 31-60 days 5,395 34 4,417 62 Past due 61-90 days 2,008 274 2,386 277 Past due more than 91 days 3,431 1,360 2,220 1,164 72,207 1,845 55,384 1,593 b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses: it also maintains a 2m overdraft facility 2009: 2m on which interest would be payable at LIBOR plus 150 basis points.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: 31 December 2010 Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than amount cash flows 12 months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Finance lease liabilities 136 145 54 45 46 Trade and other payables 56,781 56,781 56,781 Forward exchange contracts 294 294 294 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 57,251 57,260 57,129 45 46 40 The forward exchange contracts will be settled on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is 50,428,000 2009: 59,410,000 and the gross inflow is 51,191,000 2009: 59,185,000.

Financial instruments continued c Market Risks Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than sterling.
The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other non-sterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures are maintained and hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts that hedge forecast transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2010 was a 624,000 asset 2009: 315,000 liability comprising an asset of 918,000 2009: 942,000 and a liability of 294,000 2009: 1,257,000.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2010 mature in 2011 and 2012.
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of either the US dollar or euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Groups profit before interest and tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 300,000 and 250,000 respectively.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2010 2009 2010 2009 US dollar 1.54 1.54 1.57 1.61 Euro 1.16 1.13 1.17 1.13 ii Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns Sterling, USD and Renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2010 2009 Fixed rate financial liabilities 118 195 Floating rate financial liabilities 58 71 176 266 The fixed and floating rate financial liabilities comprise finance leases.
The floating rate obligations bear interest at rates determined by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 6.4% 2009: 4.1% per annum.
The weighted average period for which interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is 2.5 years.

The Group defines capital as net funds and equity attributable to share holders see note 16.
There are no external imposed restrictions on the Groups capital structure.
The Groups net funds at 31 December were as follows: 2010 2009 Total borrowings 176 266 Cash and cash equivalents note 15 97,881 78,676 Group net funds 97,705 78,410 In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

Basis for determining fair values The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above.
Designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date, and gains and losses taken to equity.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Operating leases Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows: 2010 2009 Less than one year 1,830 1,357 Between one and five years 5,738 6,128 More than five years 315 1,261 7,883 8,746 Of the 7,883,000 2009: 8,746,000, 5,792,000 2009: 6,804,000 relates to property and the balance to plant and equipment.
