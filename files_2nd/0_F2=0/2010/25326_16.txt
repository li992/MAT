International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
General information International Public Partnerships Limited is a closed ended authorised investment company incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
The address of the registered office is given on page 3.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Investment Policy, Portfolio Interest and Investment Advisors Report on pages 11, 12 and 16 respectively.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and represents the functional currency of the Group.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The United Kingdom partnerships within the International Public Partnerships Limited Group fall to be classified as qualifying partnerships, as defined in the Partnerships and Unlimited Companies Accounts Regulations 1993 as amended by SI 2005 No 1987 The Partnerships and Unlimited Companies Accounts Amendment Regulations 2005, and as such the exemption from preparing accounts is utilised by them as their results are included in these consolidated accounts and appropriate disclosure of this exemption will be provided in the partnerships financial statements.
Basis of preparation As set out in the Directors Report, the Directors, in their consideration of going concern have reviewed comprehensive cash flow forecasts prepared by management, which are based on prudent market data and past experience and believe, based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Group's committed banking facilities and the available headroom, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 67 million as at 31 December 2010, banking facilities available for investment in new or existing projects which are committed until May 2011, similar terms have been agreed with the existing providers to enter into a new three year facility from May 2011 and is forecast to continue in full compliance with the associated banking covenants.
Further, the Company completed a series of capital raisings: In January 2010, which provided additional cash resources in excess of 89 million: In September 2010, the Group raised an additional 22.4 million of equity through a Tap issue: and In January 2011, the Company raised an additional 2.34 million of equity through an existing Tap facility.
Certain risks and uncertainties which arise as a result of the current economic environment have been considered by the Board.
The Board has concluded that these do not represent a significant threat to the Group as its income is generated from a portfolio of PFI concessions which are supported by government backed cash flows and are forecast to cover the Group's committed costs.
The Groups cash, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are disclosed in notes 21 and 22.
In addition, the Groups policy for management of exposure to financial risk, including liquidity, foreign exchange, credit and interest risks are set out in notes 3, 23 and 29.
Adoption of new and revised Standards In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations are effective for the current year and resulted in a change in the accounting policies of the Group.
These are: 48 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued IFRS 3 revised 2008 - Business Combinations This has resulted in a revision to the accounting policy on business combinations.
The most significant changes to the existing policy are: Acquisition costs are now expensed in the Income Statement whereas previously they were included in the cost of the acquisition: Changes to contingent consideration classified as equity after the date of acquisition are recognised directly in equity whereas previously there was an adjustment to goodwill: Other changes to contingent consideration after the date of acquisition are recognised in profit or loss whereas previously there was an adjustment to goodwill.
These changes are not retrospective and do not affect business combinations prior to 1 January 2010.
The amendments to the following standards below did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments April 2009 IAS 7 Statements of Cash Flows Amendments April 2009 IAS17 Leases Amendments April 2009 IAS36 Impairment of Assets Amendments April 2009 IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Amendments relating to group cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations Amendments April 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments Amendments April 2009 At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments The adoption of IFRS 9 which the Group plans to adopt for the year beginning on 1 January 2013 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments.
IAS 24 Amended - Related Party Disclosures The Directors do not expect that the adoption of this Standard in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, issued by, or adopted by, the International Accounting Standards Board, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of Guernsey and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the reported amounts in these financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as amended to reflect certain items that are presented at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
49 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries up to 31 December 2010.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition and where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Any costs incurred after 1 January 2010 are charged to the Income Statement.
Prior to 31 December 2009, any costs directly attributable to the acquisition were included as part of the costs of acquisition.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess amount arising on acquisition is recognised as an intangible asset and initially carried at fair value at acquisition.
This intangible asset represents the rights to future profits on the service element of the related concessions.
The non-controlling interests in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost and adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised in the financial statements.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Intangibles An intangible asset is recognised on the acquisition of service concession arrangements and represents the rights to future profits on the service element of these concessions.
This intangible is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently amortised over the life of the underlying concessions.
The Group also recognises an intangible asset on the right to charge users of the infrastructure assets within a service concession.
This intangible asset is initially measured at fair value and is subsequently amortised over the remaining life of the concession from the date on which it is available for use.
50 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at fair value on acquisition, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method at 4.3% per annum.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the following in respect of PFI PPP projects: The value of construction work-in-progress on PFI projects where the principal asset is to be accounted for as a financial or intangible asset: Availability fees and usage fees on PFI projects where the principal asset is accounted for as a fixed or intangible asset: Revenues from the provision of facilities management services to PFI projects: Non-core facility recharges being recovered for ad hoc services delivered by PFI projects at the request of the client: and Third-party revenues on PFI projects.
Financial asset interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established.
Acquisition costs Acquisition costs are those costs predominantly legal and financial advisory costs, due diligence costs, stamp duty and including the investment advisory fees in respect of the acquisition incurred by the Group in connection with acquisitions of investments.
Prior to 31 December 2009, acquisition costs are included in the price in determining the cost of the Groups investments.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pound sterling which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at spot rates on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at spot rates.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies 51 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued are translated at the spot rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rate at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where the property of PFI PPP projects is accounted for as a financial or intangible asset in the course of construction, the sale is deemed to take place as construction commences and borrowing costs on the associated project finance are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Taxation The Company has obtained exempt company status in Guernsey under the terms of the Income Tax exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989 and accordingly is subject to an annual charge of currently 600.
The Companys subsidiaries are subject to corporate income tax on any taxable income, after allowing for both revenue and capital deductions arising from their activities.
The tax expense included in the income statement represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax and is calculated in accordance with applicable legislation in the jurisdictions in which each entity operates.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in past or future years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
52 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
The carrying value of the financial asset is adjusted to reflect changes in actual and estimated cash flows with any adjustment recognised as income or expense in profit or loss.
The change in carrying value is calculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets designated as at FVTPL.
Available for sale financial assets Investments classified as available for sale are measured initially and at each subsequent reporting date at fair value.
For available for sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit or loss for the period.
The fair value of available for sale financial assets are determined as follows: the fair value of available for sale financial assets with standard terms and conditions and traded on an active liquid market are determined with reference to quoted market prices: or the fair value of other available for sale financial assets are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable market transactions.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis as referred to above.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Financial liabilities are classified as either FVTPL or as other financial liabilities.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
53 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs which are expensed against the Companys Share Premium Account as allowed by the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group may use foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge these exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Due to the nature of PFI PPP projects, it is important that key financial risks are hedged at the inception of the project, and indeed the funders of the projects insist on this.
Therefore each PFI PPP project fixes the interest rate on its debt.
In a minority of cases, this is achieved by either financing the project with a fixed rate bond or fixed rate bank debt.
In the majority of cases, this is achieved by funding the project with a variable rate bank debt which is fully swapped into fixed rate at the inception of the project.
Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationships between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with the risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking various transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where ineffectiveness is judged to have occurred, either a proportion or the full amount of the ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement depending on the level of effectiveness experienced.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is terminated, for example if a project is refinanced.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is recycled through the income statement over the remaining life of the instrument on a straight line basis.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Embedded derivatives Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments and other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Credit risk The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk as the Group derives revenue from PFI concessions with government departments, local authorities and other public sector clients: with the exception of the following concessions: RiverCity Motorway - which derives toll revenue at the point of sale: 54 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued the Diabolo Project which predominately derives revenue from the local authority, however is exposed to an element of demand risk: and Angel Trains which provides rolling stock to various Train Operating Companies TOCs under long term lease arrangements.
Certain elements of the revenue generated by Angel Trains benefits from Section 54 undertakings.
These undertakings provide guaranteed minimum lease rentals to entities such as Angel Trains for periods exceeding the first lease length therefore greatly mitigating re-lease risk on fleets considered strategic by the Department for Transport and are granted at the time of the initial investment.
The Group policy is to deal only with credit worthy counter parties in its banking and sub contracting arrangements.
Liquidity risk The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management and maintains sufficient cash reserves to meet its obligations.
The very nature of a PFI concession provides predictable long-term stable cash flows.
Loans in PFI project entities are non-recourse.
Non-recourse loans are those which are secured solely on a specific asset and its future income.
The terms of the finance agreements provide that the lender will not seek in any way to enforce repayment of either principal or interest from the rest of the Group and the Group is not obliged, nor does it intend, to support any losses.
In 2008 the Group took out a corporate debt facility for 100 million, of which nil was drawn down at 31 December 2010.
This facility matures on 8 May 2011 and is secured over all assets of the Company and similar terms have been agreed in principle with the existing providers to enter a new three year facility from May 2011.
This facility is of sufficient size to meet the Groups foreseeable funding requirements, including providing significant headroom available to support acquisitions, should suitable opportunities be identified and executed.
This facility cannot be used for working capital purposes.
Inflation risk The revenues and expenditure of project entities developed under PFI PPP are partly or wholly subject to indexation.
An assumption is made that inflation will increase at a long-term rate which may vary depending on country and from time to time.
The effect on investment returns if inflation is above or below the original projections for this long term rate is dependent on the nature of the underlying project earnings and any unitary charge indexation provisions agreed with the Public Sector Client.
The Groups ability to meet targets and its objective may be adversely or positively affected by inflation and or deflation.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movement, as a result of its investments in assets which have functional currency other than Sterling and are not hedged as at 31 December 2010.
The Group has entered into forward exchange contracts to mitigate these risks.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where an intangible is not yet ready for use, it is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
55 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For shares classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised through profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
56 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued PFI PPP Concessions In accordance with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee Interpretation 12 Service Concessions Arrangements IFRIC 12 and the various provisions of IFRS, the Group has determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from PFI and similar contracts.
Results of all PFI PPP concessions which fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 conform to the following policies: Financial assets Service concessions are accounted for as financial assets where the Group, as operator, has a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the Client grantor.
Income is recognised by allocating a proportion of total cash receivable to construction income and service income.
The residual element of cash receivable is allocated to the financial asset, using the effective interest method, giving rise to interest income which is recognised in the income statement.
During construction, the financial assets are stated at cost, plus attributable profit to the extent that this is reasonably certain, less any losses incurred or foreseen in bringing construction to completion, and less amounts received as progress payments.
Costs for this purpose include valuation of all work done by subcontractors whether certified or not, and all overheads other than those relating to the general administration of the relevant companies.
For any contracts where receipts exceed the book value of work done, the excess is included in creditors as payments on account.
Financial assets are accounted for as either: loans and receivables and measured at fair value at inception and thereafter carried at amortised cost, less provision for impairment: or available for sale financial assets and measured at fair value with fair value gains or losses recognised directly in equity through the statement of changes in equity and recycled into the income statement on sale or impairment of the asset at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in profit or loss for the period.
The Companys interpretation of this policy is that financial assets in the operational phase or acquired towards the end of the construction phase are classified as loans and receivables as cash flows are deemed to be fixed and determinable.
Financial assets for concessions in the construction phases or acquired in early construction, are classified as available for sale financial assets, reflecting the risk in the construction phase that cash flows may not be fixed and determinable.
Intangible assets within scope of IFRIC 12 : Service concessions are accounted for as intangible assets where the Group, as operator, has a contractual right to charge users of the public services.
The intangible asset is amortised to estimated residual value over the remaining life of the service concession and tested each year for impairment.
Leases Service concessions which fall outside of the scope of IFRIC 12 are assessed in terms of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.
Where it is assessed that the service concession does contain a lease, the concession is considered as either a finance lease or an operating lease in terms of IAS 17 Leases.
Under IAS 17, a finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
57 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued When the benefits and risks with the asset reside with the PFI project company these assets are accordingly disclosed in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is calculated over the life of the concession or specific asset life if shorter.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Adoption of IFRIC 12 The Directors decided to early adopt the principles of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee Interpretation 12 IFRIC 12.
As part of this process each individual service concession was assessed to determine whether it falls within the scope of IFRIC 12.
Service concessions fall within the scope where the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and the price: and the grantor controls, through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise, any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the service arrangement.
Following this review it was determined that the majority of the PFI concessions controlled fall within this scope.
Service concessions are determined to be financial assets where the operator has a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor.
Alternatively, service concessions are determined to be intangible assets to the extent the operator has a contractual right to charge users of the public services.
Where service concessions are determined to contain both of these elements, a bifurcated model will be adopted.
The majority of PFI concessions which fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 are considered to be financial assets on the basis that substantially all of the unitary charge is received from the grantor on an availability basis.
One of the Group's PFI concessions falls to be accounted for using the bifurcated model, where a financial asset is recognised on the basis that substantially all of the unitary charge is received from the grantor on an availability basis and an intangible asset in relation to the right to charge users of the infrastructure asset on the 'demand' basis.
Under the guidance of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Measurement and Recognition, the financial asset is accounted for as either a loan and receivable or as an available for sale financial asset.
A loan and receivable is appropriate where there are fixed and determinable payments and the operator will recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than because of credit deterioration.
Financial assets that do not meet these criteria are designated as available for sale financial assets.
Service concessions which have future significant development activities are classified as available for sale financial assets as the timing and amount of future payments and receipts are not necessarily fixed.
The Directors are of the opinion that loans and receivables is the appropriate accounting treatment for the majority of these financial assets, due to the nature of the underlying service concessions.
Financial Assets The fair value during the construction phase of financial assets is determined by reference to the construction spend plus financial income less availability payments received from the grantor.
The fair value during the operational phase of financial assets has been determined by discounting future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate and with reference to recent market transactions.
The discount rates utilised to discount future cash flows are calculated by adding a project specific premium to the 15-year gilt yield at 31 December 2010.
The premium takes into account several factors, including but not limited to, the stage reached by each project, the period of operation and historical track record.

Revenue and other income An analysis of the Groups revenue and other income is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 000s 000s Continuing operations Revenue Construction services 420,989 550,349 Availability and facility management fees 60,840 39,621 Non-core facility recharges 7,991 9,789 Sub-total 489,820 599,759 Other income Interest income on deposits 40,657 49,343 Financial asset interest income 107,832 73,867 Investment income 148,489 123,210 Share of results from associates 4,547 3,025 Other operating income 5,145 8,595 Total 648,001 734,589 Other operating income includes distributions received from investments that are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Segmental reporting IFRS 8 - Operating segments was effective for reporting periods from 1 January 2009 and adopts a through the eyes of the management approach to an entitys reporting of information relating to its operating segments and also requires an entity to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments.
Based on a review of information provided to the chief operating decision makers in International Public Partnerships Limited the Group has identified four reportable segments based on the geographical risk associated within the Group, as these reportable segments are on the basis on which the Group reports information to the chief operating decision makers.
The factors used to identify the Groups reportable segments are centred on the risk free rates and the maturity of the PFI PPP industry within each country.
Further, foreign exchange and political risk is identified, as these also determine where resources are allocated.
Management has concluded that the Group is currently organised into four reportable segments being UK, Europe non UK, Australia and North America.

Cash and cash equivalents There has been a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from 31 December 2009 of 209 million primarily due to an increase in construction activity on Royal Childrens Hospital and the construction completion of Alberta Schools which are financed by structured bond financing arrangements.

At 31 December 2010, the weighted average range of discount rates applied was 1.06% to 5.9% 2009: 2.3% to 7.1%.
Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
Contracts with nominal values of 709 million 2009 592 million have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 4.61% 2009 4.61% for periods up until 2036 and have floating interest receipts at the relevant inter bank rate.
The net fair value of swaps entered into at 31 December 2010 is estimated at negative 129.9 million 2009: negative 85.0 million.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the respective balance sheet dates.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges.
The after tax increase in the fair value for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 32.4 million 2009: 37.3 million after tax decrease has been deferred in equity.
CPI swaps The Group uses CPI swaps to manage its exposure to inflationary movements on the bonds issued in the Royal Childrens Hospital concession.
CPI linked swaps with no net nominal value have CPI linked payments for periods up until 2021 and have CPI linked receipts for the duration of the project.
CPI linked swaps are used to hedge two equal and opposite bond values of AUD250 million.
The CPI swaps held by Royal Childrens Hospital fair value at 31 December 2010 - 2.5 million liability 2009 1.9 million liability have not been hedge accounted for based on the assumption that the swap is to have a shorter life than the hedged item the borrowings will be refinanced in 2021 whereas the swap will be terminated which will give rise to ineffectiveness.
The swap movement for the year was a loss of 238,000 2009: 606,000 profit has been recognised in profit and loss, the remainder of the movement for the year is in respect of foreign exchange translation.
Foreign exchange forward contracts During the year the Company has entered into a number of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the Companys exposure to movements in foreign currency.
The Company has hedged highly probable revenue from its overseas operations that are derived in Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Euro.
All of these forward foreign exchange contracts are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
The nominal value of the forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2010 is 18.8 million 2009 25.9 million.

In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, this provision was recorded as a contingent liability as part of the net assets and liabilities acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary.
The decrease in short term provisions during the year is due to the successful settlement of the claim for additional construction costs on a PFI concession which has led to the release of the provision.
Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of non-recourse debt and the Groups corporate facility, and includes the borrowings, disclosed in note 22, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 30 to 33.
The Group aims to deliver its objective by investing available cash and using leverage whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet on-going expenses and dividend payments.
The Groups investment policy is set out on pages 8 to 11 of the Annual Report.
Gearing ratio The Groups Investment Advisor reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis.
As part of this review, the Investment Advisor considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
As 77 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued stated in the initial public offering prospectus, the Group has committed to a maximum gearing ratio of 50% excluding non-recourse project level debt as the proportion of recourse debt to portfolio valuation.
As at the date of this Annual Report all debt was non-recourse project level debt with the exception of the corporate debt facility which is secured over all the assets of the Company.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.

These risks include: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and nonderivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
In line with the lending requirements under project agreements for PFI PPP type investments there is generally a requirement for the underlying project entity to either enter a fixed rate loan agreement for the life of the concession or, if a variable interest rate loan is agreed, an interest rate swap agreement will be entered into at the commencement of the loan.
The effect of the interest rate swap is to mitigate any interest rate risk that the underlying project entity may be exposed to.
As a result, the group has minimal exposure to any change in interest rates.
The Group may also enter forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign exchange risk.
Sensitivities around the Groups exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rates are detailed in the note below.
There has been no change during the year to the manner in which the Group manages and measures the risks.
Forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts based on the expected timing of these.
Generally, the Group intends to cover forward foreign exchange payments and receipts for up to a four-year period.
As at 31 December 2010 the Group had entered into foreign exchange contracts in accordance with the Groups Treasury Policy.
The following table details the forward foreign currency FC contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2010: Average exchange rate Foreign Notional value Outstanding contracts currency Fair value 2010 2010 2010 2010 000 000 000 Cash flow hedges Buy pound sterling Less than 12 months 1.0000 9,615 9,615 1,716 1 to 4 years 1.0000 5,612 5,612 1,025 79 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Outstanding contracts Average exchange rate Local currency Notional value Fair value 2010 2010 2010 2010 000 000 000 Sell Euro Less than 12 months 1.1344 3,572 3,149 61 1 to 4 years 1.1302 1,709 1,512 27 Sell Canadian dollars Less than 12 months 1.7957 2,558 1,425 215 1 to 4 years 1.7960 1,493 831 118 Sell Australian dollars Less than 12 months 2.0595 10,383 5,041 1,562 1 to 4 years 2.1283 6,955 3,268 934 Forward foreign exchange liability 2,741 Average exchange rate Foreign Notional value Outstanding contracts currency Fair value 2009 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 Cash flow hedges Buy pound sterling Less than 12 months 1.0000 9,216 9,216 497 1 to 4 years 1.0000 15,227 15,227 783 Outstanding contracts Average exchange rate Local currency Notional value Fair value 2009 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 Sell Euro Less than 12 months 1.1377 2,897 2,547 27 1 to 4 years 1.1323 5,282 4,661 67 Sell Canadian dollars Less than 12 months 1.7950 1,827 1,018 56 1 to 4 years 1.7959 4,051 2,256 124 Sell Australian dollars Less than 12 months 1.9894 11,223 5,651 414 1 to 4 years 2.1072 17,338 8,310 592 Forward foreign exchange liability 1,280 80 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Currency risk arises in financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured.
Currency risk does not arise from financial instruments that are non-monetary items or from financial instruments denominated in the functional currency.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary financial instruments at the reporting date are set out in the table below: Liabilities Assets 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2010 2009 2010 2009 000s 000s 000s 000s Euro - - 39,901 26,224 Canadian dollar - - 8 - Australian dollar - - 737 6 In the current year these balances relate to monetary loans to subsidiaries and in the prior year these represented cash balances held predominantly to cover future equity investments in these currencies.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the following countries: Australia AUD dollar currency Canada CAD dollar currency Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy and Germany Euro currency.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis below includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary financial instruments and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates against sterling.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit and other equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be positive.
Euro currency AUD dollar currency CAD dollar currency impact impact impact 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Profit or loss before tax 3,627 2,384 67 1 1 - The reasons for the foreign currency impacts are the exposure of the Group to foreign exchange fluctuations as a result of holding multi currency financial instruments.
In managements opinion, the sensitivity analysis is 81 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk, as the year end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
In addition, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance date.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the translation reserve.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies for foreign operations.
The sensitivity table adjusts for the exchange rates prevailing at the balance date as applied to the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations and the average rate for the year applied to the income and expense items for a 10% change in foreign currency rates against Sterling.
A positive number below indicates an increase in net assets and profit where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on net assets and profit, and the balances below would be negative.
Euro currency AUD dollar currency CAD dollar currency impact impact impact 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Impact on net assets 812 349 1,671 1,532 1,337 547 Impact on profit 265 365 331 4 528 315 Interest rate risk management The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk as the underlying borrowings within the Group are either fixed rate loans or an interest rate swap agreement is entered into to mitigate any fluctuations in interest rates.
It is generally a requirement under a PFI PPP concession that any borrowings are matched against the life of the concession.
Hedging activities are aligned with the period of the loan, which also mirrors the concession period and are highly effective.
Therefore, the Group is not exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates over its variable rate borrowings.
The fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost and hence not exposed to fair value movements due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups exposures to interest rate movements on financial assets are detailed in the interest rate sensitivity analysis section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
A 0.5% 2009: 0.5% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
The Groups available for sale financial assets comprise service concession financial assets that fall within the following categories and have the following values: Available for sale financial assets under construction, not exposed to interest rate risk 702.1 million: Available for sale financial assets where construction is completed exposed to interest rate risk 509.7 million: Listed and unlisted equity investments not exposed to interest rate risk 17.9 million.
82 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The Groups loans and receivable financial assets comprise fixed rate financial assets that are being carried at amortised cost and hence not exposed to fair value movements due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups derivative financial instruments and certain available for sale financial assets are exposed to fair value movements due to changes in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009 would not be materially impacted as the interest rate risk associated with floating rate liabilities has been mitigated through interest rate SWAP agreements.
The corporate facility was repaid in full in February 2010: and net assets and other equity reserves would decrease by 70.0 million and 161.3 million respectively 2009: increase decrease by 54.4 million 41.9 million as a result of the changes in the fair value of the interest rate SWAP agreements, if the interest rate was 0.5% higher lower.
While the Directors note that due to interest rate movements in the year the valuation of interest rate swaps have moved by 46 million 2009: 56 million, in their opinion interest rates are unlikely to change by more than plus or minus 50 basis points over the next year, which has therefore been used in this sensitivity analysis.
A sensitivity analysis for monetary assets at 31 December 2010 using a 0.5% increase and a 0.5% decrease in the average interest rate would result in an increase in profit of 25.6 million 2009: 4.2 million and a decrease of 25.6 million 2009: 4.2 million respectively.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the interest rate yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges floating to fixed rate debt Outstanding Average Fair value receive floating contract fixed interest Notional principal pay fixed rate amount liability contracts 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Total 4.62 4.61 688,141 592,281 132,657 85,008 All interest rate swap contracts exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts.
These are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
83 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Other price risks The Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from equity investments.
Investments in listed equity securities present the Group with opportunity for return through dividend income and trading gains.
All equity investments are designated as available for sale and are held for strategic rather than trading purposes.
The Group does not actively trade these investments.
As these movements all go through the statement of changes in equity there is no impact on the income statement when the equity prices change.
If the price of the listed equity had been 5% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant as at 31 December 2010 and 2009, the Groups net assets and equity reserves would increase decrease by nil 2009: increase decrease by 277,186 and the impairment charge in the income statement would have been decreased increased by nil 2009: 277,186. Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and PFI PPP concessions are entered into with government or semi government authorities.
Receivables consist of a small number of government or semi government counterparties that are spread across an increasingly diverse geographical area.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single non government or semi government counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on liquid funds, cash held on deposit and financial instruments.
The Group mitigates this risk by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies currently with Moodys ranging between Aa1 and A1.
The Group has considered the creditworthiness of facilities managers and construction sub-contractors and the availability of alternative sub-contractors in the event of default and Group policy is only to deal with creditworthy contractors.
Refer to note 22 for further details on the corporate debt facility.
As at 31 December 2010 the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk over financial assets represents the carrying amount of 2.4 billion 2009: 2.2 billion as disclosed earlier in this note.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and longterm funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
In May 2008, the Group entered into a corporate debt facility in order to allow the Group greater flexibility in respect of accepting investment opportunities as they arise.
As at 31 December 2010 the Group had drawn down nil of the 100m facility.
Liquidity risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
Financial assets in this category include equity shares.
The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market data.
Except as detailed in the following table, the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values: Carrying amount Fair value 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2010 2009 2010 2009 000s 000s 000s 000s Financial assets Loans and receivables 473,999 474,467 558,245 557,504 Financial liabilities Bank loans at fixed interest rates 308,516 315,085 442,265 476,109 Assumptions used in determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of the Groups loans and receivables has been determined using discounted cash flow methodology.
In determining the discount rate, consideration is given to a number of market factors including but not limited to the prevailing risk free rate, an appropriate project specific risk premium and recent transactions that have similar characteristics.
At 31 December 2010 for project debt which is non recourse to the group covenants are in respect of historic and future interest cover ratios in the range of 1.01 times historic interest cover ratio and 1.75 times future interest cover ratio.
The fair value of the fixed rate bank loans has been calculated using discounted cash flow methodology.

All gains and losses included in other comprehensive income relate to unlisted equities held at the balance sheet date.
Significant assumptions used in determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities Unlisted shares The financial statements include holdings in unlisted shares which are measured at fair value note 19.
Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model, which includes some assumptions that are not supportable by observable market prices or rates.
In determining the fair value a risk adjusted discount factor of 12.0% 2009: 12.13% is used.
If these inputs to the valuation model were 0.5% higher lower while all the other variables were held constant, the carrying amount of the shares would decrease increase by 0.1 million 2009: decrease increase by 0.7 million.

The Company holds a 3.82% interest in RiverCity Motorway Pty Limited.
As at 31 December 2010 the Company valued this holding on a mark to market basis at less than 220,000, which represented less than 0.1% of the Companys portfolio.
The Company awaits further information but has been monitoring this position for some time and is unsurprised by this development.
The RiverCity Motorway project differs from the remainder of the Companys portfolio in that revenues generated by the project are based on the level of demand for that asset i. e. motorists paying a toll rather than the availability of the asset, the latter being the basis upon which the 92 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued vast majority of the portfolios revenues are received and which is uncorrelated to the level of demand for an asset.

The concessions vary on the nature of the asset but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concession may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the accommodation based assets normally includes the provision of facilities management services such as cleaning, catering, caretaking, security, maintenance, and lifecycle.
At the end of the concession period on the majority of the concessions the assets are returned back to the concession provider.
However on four of the projects the Group has a right to retain the asset.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specific Project Documentation.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operators rights to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the service company to fulfil its requirements The table overleaf sets out the Groups economic interests in PFI concessions.
All economic interests reflect an investment in the capital of the underlying project.
