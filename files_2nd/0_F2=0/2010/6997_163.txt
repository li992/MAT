Taxation continued The tax charge is reconciled with the standard rate of UK corporation tax as follows: For the period 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 2 April 2010 3 April 2009 m m Profit before tax 109.7 77.5 UK corporation tax at standard rate of 28% 2009: 28% 30.7 21.7 Factors affecting the charge for the period: Depreciation on expenditure not eligible for tax relief 1.8 0.9 Employee share options 0.2 0.2 Other disallowable expenses 0.7 0.6 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 0.3 1.7 Total tax charge for the period 32.7 21.7 In this financial period, the UK corporation tax standard rate was 28%.
The underlying tax rate on trading was 29.4% 2009: 29.7%, principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure in respect of mezzanine floors and other store infrastructure.
This level of tax non-deductibility is anticipated for the foreseeable future.
The higher tax rate of 29.8% compared to the prior year 2009: 28.0% is mainly due to the release of tax provisions in the prior year following the favourable settlement of tax computations, in particular relating to capital allowance claims.
The tax charge of 32.7m 2009: 21.7m includes a 1.4m 2009: 4.6m credit in respect of the tax on non-recurring costs, as detailed in Note 5.
Income tax of 0.6m on other comprehensive income relates to the fair value of forward currency contracts outstanding at the year end.
