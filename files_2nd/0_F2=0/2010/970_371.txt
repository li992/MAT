Under the terms of these agreements, the Investment Companies have purchased Anglo American plc shares on the market and have granted to Tenon the right to nominate a third party which may include Anglo American plc but not any of its subsidiaries to take transfer of the Anglo American plc shares each has purchased on the market.
Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including associated costs for this right to nominate which together with subscriptions by Tenon for non-voting participating redeemable preference shares in the Investment Companies provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market.
These payments by Tenon were sourced from the cash resources of AASA.
Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31December 2025 against payment of an average amount of $8.22 per share to Epoch, $12.78 per share to Epoch Two and $10.61 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party.
These funds will then become available for redemption of the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies.
The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the AngloAmerican plc shares will accrue to Tenon and, in accordance with paragraph 33 of IAS 32, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the income statement of Anglo American plc.
Under the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares.
