Experienced management team Each of our businesses is led by highly experienced management teams giving us real strength and depth of leadership.
Our leaders have demonstrated excellent track records of building strong businesses and creating value.
Market-leading brands We have some of the most recognised and highly trusted brands in the industry, which reduces the cost of customer acquisition and means we are highly attractive to our accommodation providers and distribution partners.
Market-leading positions We are either the number one or number two tour operator in almost all of our mainstream source markets, including leadership positions in the UK, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Market consolidation Consolidation in some of our key markets has improved the structure of the industry, helping to remove excess supply from the market.
Economies of scale We buy over 150 million bednights per year, making us one of the largest distributors of accommodation globally.
Our scale gives us a competitive advantage when negotiating with suppliers, allowing us to offer excellent value to our customers.
Turnaround potential In 2009, we identified 142m of turnaround opportunities as we took strategic actions to improve margins in a number of underperforming businesses.
After delivering 53m of these in 2010, a further 89m of opportunities for margin improvement remains.
Exposure to higher growth specialist travel Almost one third of our profits are generated by our portfolio of specialist businesses which enjoy high growth and margin characteristics, including specialist tour operators offering unique, experiential travel experiences and online accommodation providers.
Emerging markets We have established a significant presence in the fast-growing Russian and Ukrainian source markets, leaving us well positioned to take advantage of the potential in these markets.
We have an existing presence in Brazil, China and India and are investigating the opportunities in these exciting markets.
