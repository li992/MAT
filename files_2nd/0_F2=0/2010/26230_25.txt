The expected return on in-force is based on the unwind of the risk discount rate on the opening, adjusted base value of in-force VIF.
The opening base VIF of the Risk and Savings business was 3,679m in 2010.
This is adjusted for effects of opening model changes of 39m to give an adjusted opening base VIF of 3,718m.
This is then multiplied by the opening risk discount rate of 8.0% and the result grossed up at the notional attributed tax rate of 27% to give a return of 407m.

The opening base VIF of the Risk and Savings business was 4,268m in 2009.
This is adjusted for the effects of opening model changes of 31m to give an adjusted opening base VIF of 4,299m.
This is then multiplied by the opening risk discount rate of 8.3% and the result grossed up at the notional attributed tax rate of 28% to give a return of 496m.
The 2009 Group capital and financing contribution from shareholder net worth SNW of 125m comprises the average return of 7% on the average balance of invested assets of 2.1bn 138m : offset by an adjustment for opening tax and other modelling changes of 2 m and pre-tax corporate expenses charged to shareholders funds of 11 m. 3.

In 2009, in addition to current year investment return, 469m was released from the Shareholder Retained Capital and declared as surplus for tax purposes.
As a result of the 2007 corporate restructure, this release along with current year movements did not give rise to any incremental tax and therefore resulted in a 59m benefit to embedded value.

The present value of new business premiums PVNBP on the EEV basis is defined as the present value of annual premiums plus single premiums for any given period.
It is calculated using the same assumptions as for the contribution from new business but determined as at the point of sale.
The contribution from new business is defined as the present value at point of sale of assumed profits from new business written in the period and then rolled forward to the end of the financial period using the risk discount rate applicable at the end of the reporting period.

Risk and Savings mortality assumption changes relates to favourable annuitant mortality experience in 2009 which has been reflected in the latest three year average experience, and favourable individual protection mortality.
Risk and Savings expense assumption changes primarily reflects the 76m impact of the cost reductions delivered in 2009: partially offset by the impact of assumed higher future investment expenses of 29 m. Other smaller items have a net positive impact of 13m.
Expense experience variances include the impact of redundancy costs as a result of the cost reduction programme of 17 m and exceptional project expenses and other items of 8 m: partially offset by the impact of lower maintenance expenses than assumed of 6m.
Risk and Savings other experience variances include 44m reflecting a reassessment of future reserve releases as data is loaded onto the BPA system and 43m relating to one-off modelling improvements.
International mortality operating assumption changes primarily reflects improved claims ratios on group protection business in France, following positive experience in 2009.

The 103m Risk and Savings covered business variation from longer term investment return reflects the strong recovery in equity and property markets resulting in a 85m investment variance from the Savings business on assets backing with-profit policies together with higher expected management charges on unit linked policies.
A further 73m investment variance is due to the impact on projected tax within the embedded value from both prior year tax adjustments and market recoveries during 2010.
Increased cost of capital arising from the reduction in the equity ratio for assets backing solvency capital has resulted in a 71 m negative variance.
Additionally, favourable market conditions during 2010 have allowed the annuity business to reduce some of its credit exposure to corporates and overall trading impact has resulted in a 18m positive variation.
2. International covered business variation from longer term investment return primarily reflects the impact of the US capital restructure.
Group capital and financing primarily relates to negative debt related investment variance.
