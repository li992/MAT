indd 81 81 21 12 2010 21 12 2010 22:47 22:47 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired, or disposed of, are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
Where a transaction is a business combination amongst entities under common control, the requirements of IFRS 3 R are applied.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, contingent consideration arrangements entered into, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Directly attributable transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Identi able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
When the ownership of an acquired company is less than 100%, the non-controlling interest is measured as the proportion of the recognised net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identi able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Where audited financial accounts are not coterminous with those of the Group, the financial information is derived from the last audited accounts available and unaudited management accounts for the period up to the Companys balance sheet date.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 Consolidation special purpose entities, indicates that certain special purpose entities SPEs, which are involved in aircraft leasing arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
As a consequence, the Group has consolidated three 2009: three SPEs that own four 2009: four aircraft operated by the Group on operating leases.
In addition, during the prior year the operations of the German airline were placed in a holding company in which the Group owns a 50.0023% direct interest.
All risks and rewards continue to be held by the Group and, in accordance with accounting standards, the entity has been treated as being 100% controlled and fully consolidated by the Group.
Associates and joint ventures Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts signi cant in uence, but not control or joint control, are associates.
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Group income statement using the equity accounting method.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the Group balance sheet at cost, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entity, and including any goodwill identi ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
When the Groups shares of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provided evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset, and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identi able cash ows cash-generating units.
The allocation of goodwill is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to bene t from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each segment in which it operates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the pro t or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets other Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Groups balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets with inde nite useful lives are not amortised.
For all other intangible assets, amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets useful life, as follows: Brands 10 years to inde nite life Customer relationships 1 to 15 years Computer software 3 to 10 years Other acquired intangible assets are assessed separately and useful lives established according to the particular circumstances.

indd 82 82 21 12 2010 21 12 2010 22:47 22:47 Directors Report Directors Report Financial Business Review Corporate Governance Statements Inde nite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash in ows.
These are considered to have an inde nite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Intangible assets with inde nite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable amount.
All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment.
If such indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Except for investment property, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight-line depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the cost of the item.
Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straightline basis and aims to write down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years Aircraft 18 years or remaining lease period if shorter Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years or remaining lease period if shorter Other xed assets 3 to 15 years Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Investment property is valued annually by external quali ed professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to re ect any material changes in fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale The Group classi es non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
To be classi ed as held for sale, the assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets, and their sale must be highly probable.
Sale is considered to be highly probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of classi cation.
Non-current assets classi ed as held for sale are carried on the Groups balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs The cost of major overhauls of owned and finance leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes is capitalised and then amortised over between two and ten years until the next scheduled major overhaul, except where the maintenance of engines and auxiliary power units is carried out under xed rate contracts, in which case the cost is spread over the period of the contract.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of operating leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours own and or the expired lease period, as a consequence of obligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain operating leases.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Revenue and direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Groups leisure travel providers, including travel agency commission, insurance and other incentives, are taken to the income statement on holiday departure.
Revenue relating to travel agency commission on third-party leisure travel products is also recognised on holiday departure.
The costs attributable to producing brochures are expensed when the brochures are available to be sent to customers or retail outlets.
Other revenue and associated expenses are taken to the income statement as earned or incurred.
Revenue and expenses exclude intra-group transactions.
Income statement presentation and separately disclosed items Pro t or loss from operations includes the results from operating activities of the Group, before its share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
The Group separately discloses in the income statement: exceptional items: amortisation of business combination intangibles: and IAS 39 fair value re-measurement.
Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and which the Groups management consider should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc and other business combinations made in subsequent years.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is signi cant and the Groups management consider that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
IAS 39 fair value re-measurement includes movements in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options in cash ow hedging relationships.
Both items are subject to market uctuations and unwind when the options or forward contracts mature and therefore are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
Finance income and costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected return on pension plan assets, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives and the movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash ow hedging relationships.
Finance costs comprise interest costs on borrowings and finance leases, unwind of the discount on provisions, interest cost on pension plan liabilities, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives and the movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash ow hedging relationships.
The movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash ow hedging relationships is included as a separately disclosed item in the income statement under the description IAS 39 fair value re-measurement.
Tax Tax represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Tax currently payable is provided on taxable pro ts based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for deferred tax so as to recognise all temporary differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future, except as set out below.
This is calculated on a non-discounted basis by reference to the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the relevant jurisdictions and for the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect either accounting or taxable pro t or loss.
Deferred tax assets are assessed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that their recovery against future taxable pro ts is probable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for the temporary differences of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution of those earnings and it is probable that they will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

The Group also operates a number of fide ned bene t schemes.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Groups obligations under the schemes calculated using the projected unit credit method and the fair value of those schemes assets.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The current service cost, representing bene ts accruing over the year, is included in the income statement as a personnel expense.
The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are presented as finance costs and finance income respectively.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in personnel expenses.
Foreign currency Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than Sterling.
The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are recorded through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the period end are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is recorded in the income statement.
When a foreign entity is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Leases Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases.
All other leases are operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives.
The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Borrowing costs The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets requiring a substantial amount of time to be ready for the intended purpose.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
When a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting as a cash ow hedge, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a derivative quali es for hedge accounting as a cash ow hedge, changes in fair value that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in the hedging reserve, except to the extent that it relates to movements in forward points on forward contracts and time value of options.
Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement along with the forward points and time value.
If a hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash ow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
When a derivative quali es for hedge accounting as a fair value hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative are recognised in the income statement when the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, attributable to the hedged risk, occur.
Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial asset or when the contractual rights expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below: Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows.

Gains or losses except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised.
At this point, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses or dividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments Short-term investments are classi ed as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Other non-current asset investments The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an appropriate valuation technique.
Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, if it is probable that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are recognised at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Termination bene ts Termination bene ts are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these bene ts.
The Group recognises termination bene ts when it is demonstrably committed to: either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination bene ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration.
The fair values of the share options are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model.
These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any differences between the booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, less cancellations.
Premiums are recognised as revenue earned premiums proportionally over the period of coverage.
Premiums are shown after the deduction of commission and premium taxes where relevant.
Claims and loss adjustment expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred based on the estimated liability for compensation owed to policyholders or third parties damaged by policyholders.
The Group does not discount its liabilities for unpaid claims.
Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using the input of assessments for individual cases reported to the Group and statistical analysis for the claims incurred but not reported.
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers, under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more contracts issued by the Group, and that meet the classi cation requirements for insurance contracts, are classi ed as reinsurance contracts held.
The bene ts to which the Group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as receivables from reinsurers.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on an annual basis.
Receivables and payables are recognised when due.
These include amounts due to and from insurance policyholders.

Those judgements determine the amount of depreciation charged in the income statement.
Recoverable amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite life Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash ows to be generated by certain of the Groups businesses in order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets with an inde nite life in relation to those businesses.
Special purpose entities The nature of the relationship with certain special purpose entities involved in leasing aircraft to the Group shows that they should be interpreted as controlled by the Group, and therefore consolidated, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite life Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with an inde nite life are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments Estimates have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft eet.
Tax The Group operates in many tax regimes and the tax implications of its operations are complex.
It can take several years for tax liabilities to be agreed with the relevant authorities.
Tax assets and liabilities represent managements estimates of tax that will be payable or recoverable in the future and may be dependent on estimates of future pro tability.
In addition, estimates have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses, and deferred tax assets have been recognised as a result.
The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates of future pro tability.
Retirement bene ts The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement bene t obligations.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses previous experience and impartial actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates.
The estimates, and the effect of variances in key estimates, are disclosed in note 35.

The 35.4m 2009: 112.8m relates to the integration of acquisitions and other restructuring projects that have been undertaken across the Thomas Cook Group.
The restructuring projects largely re ect changes made to underlying business processes and systems in the UK, Germany, the Western Europe markets and Canada to improve ef ciency and cost leadership across the Group.
The 26.0m asset impairment and onerous lease provisions in Hi Hotels relates to the long-term hotel operating leases within Hi Hotels acquired as part of the MyTravel Group, which were entered into at a time when market conditions in the Spanish holiday destinations were very favourable.
The emergence of alternative holiday destinations, the strong Euro and the global recession have resulted in signi cant margin pressure in the Spanish destinations such that many of the leases are now considered to be onerous.
We continue to pursue arbitration proceedings with the owner of the hotels which will potentially result in a reduction in the hotel rental costs.
However, it remains too early to predict whether these proceedings will be successful.
Of the 26.0m, 14.8m relates to xed assets impairment and is disclosed in note 13.
On 31 March 2010, Skyservice, a Canadian airline that provided ying capacity to our Canadian tour operator was placed in court-appointed receivership.
As a result of the collapse of Skyservice, we suffered signi cant disruption to our ying programme in April, the last month of the high season for our Canadian tour operator.
The direct costs of the disruption, together with the write down of certain receivables from Skyservice, amounted to 15.3m.
The run-off of fuel-related exceptional items amounted to 23.3m 2009: 20.7m.
These items were speci c to our fuel hedging for 2009 and 2010 and, as such, are not expected to recur in future years.
Other exceptional operating items of 7.7m 2009: 21.9m include acquisition costs and losses resulting from other exceptional operating events that are not expected to recur in future years.

At 30 September 2010, the review was undertaken on a value in use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash ows derived from those assets, using cash ow projections discounted at pre-tax rate of 10% to 12% 2009: 9% to 13% and 10% 2009: 9% to 10% for the UK and other segments respectively, re ecting speci c risks relating to the relevant cash-generating units.
The UK segment includes India and Egypt, which are discounted at a higher rate than the remainder of the UK segment.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and cost growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the year.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets and three year plans of the relevant businesses.
The cash ow forecasts re ect the risk associated with each asset.
Cash ow forecasts for years beyond the three year plan period are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
There were no impairment losses recognised on goodwill during the year 2009: nil and no reasonable change to the assumptions would lead to a material impairment.

All of the subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated in the Group accounts.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities indicates that certain special purpose entities SPEs, which are involved in aircraft leasing arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
Acquisitions made during the year During the year, the Group concluded two acquisitions, as follows: 30 April 2010, 100% of Think W3 Ltd trading as Essential Travel : and 5 July 2010, the remaining 51% of Thomas Cook Services Cyprus Ltd, a business formerly accounted for as an associate.
Details of the net assets acquired are set out in the table below: Amount recognised at acquisition date m Net assets acquired Property, plant and equipment 0.1 Investments 1.1 Trade and other receivables 0.7 Cash and cash equivalents 1.0 Trade and other payables 2.6 Tax liability 0.3 Goodwill 15.2 Total consideration 15.2 Satis ed by: Cash 4.2 Deferred consideration 1.1 Contingent consideration 9.9 15.2 The purchase price of each asset component of the acquisition represents its provisional fair value, based on managements best estimates.
The amount indicated above for trade and other receivables represents the fair value of the acquired receivables and is equal to the gross contractual cash ows, all of which is expected to be recoverable.
The acquired businesses contributed revenue of 1.5m and net pro t of 0.6m to the Group for the period from acquisition to 30 September 2010.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 October 2009, they would have contributed 2.9m to consolidated revenue and 1.2m to consolidated net pro t. The provisional goodwill of 15.2m re ects anticipated bene ts from gaining control of the Thomas Cook brand in Cyprus and increased market share in the case of Essential Travel.
Changes to the prior period acquisitions Triwest During the year, management reassessed the contingent consideration attributable to the Triwest Travel Holdings Limited acquisition based on the financial performance during the year.
This has resulted in a 1.5m reduction in contingent consideration and goodwill.
Gold Medal During the year, the fair value adjustments related to the Gold Medal acquisition were nalised and the contingent and deferred consideration was amended for changes in the expected timing and amount of cash ows.
As these changes have been made within 12 months of the acquisition date, in accordance with IFRS 3 issued 2004 Business Combinations, the fair value adjustments and the adjustments to the contingent and deferred consideration have been recognised from the date of acquisition and the comparative gures have been restated.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided.
In the case of travel services sold by third-party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those supplies.
The Groups current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance.
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods.
Deposits and prepayments also include 47.5m 2009: 65.0m of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements which are primarily attributable to the UK airline.
Securities include money market securities amounting to 2.7m 2009: 4.0m purchased as collateral against liabilities arising from part-time retirement contracts at Thomas Cook AG, which are classi ed as available-for-sale financial assets.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identi ed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are based on local management experience.
Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty and local trading conditions.
Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector.
The Directors do not consider there to be signi cant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables.

Proceeds of these issues were used to repay debt drawn under the existing bank facilities.
In May 2010, the Group entered into a new committed bank facilities agreement with a number of banks, totalling 1,050m maturing in May 2013.
The previous bank facilities were cancelled.
The new facilities comprise a 200 million term loan, repayable in annual instalments of 50m commencing October 2011, and a revolving credit facility of 850 million.
As at September 2010, the 200m term loan was drawn down and 4.2m was drawn under the revolving credit facility.
The Directors consider that the fair value of the Groups borrowings with a carrying value of 1,062.7m is 1,081.6m 2009: carrying value 940.0m: fair value 943.9m.
The fair values quoted were determined on the basis of the interest rates for the corresponding terms to maturity or repayment as at the year end.
For items maturing in less than one year, the Directors feel that the fair value is equal to the carrying amount.
Borrowing facilities As at 30 September 2010, the Group had undrawn committed debt facilities of 846m 2009: 374m.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial covenants they are not expected to prevent full utilisation of the facilities if required.
The Group has complied with its covenants throughout the year.

The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments set out above have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets in which the instruments are traded.
During the year, a loss of 69.4m 2009 restated: 42.6m gain was transferred from the hedging reserve to the income statement following recognition of the hedged transactions.
The amount included in each line item in the income statement is shown below.
In addition, a gain of 7.3m was recognised in the income statement in respect of the forward points on foreign exchange cash ow hedging contracts 2009: 21.4m gain and a gain of 2.0m in respect of the movement in the time value of options in cash ow hedging relationships 2009: 8.1m loss.

Interest rate risk The Group is subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with its bank debt, aircraft nancing and cash investments.
Interest rate swaps and interest rate collars are used to manage these risks and are usually designated as cash ow hedges of the interest rate.
Currency risk The Group has activities in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate uctuations.
Currency risks arise in connection with the sourcing of services from destinations outside the source market.
In addition, US Dollar exposure arises on the procurement of fuel and operating supplies for aircraft, as well as investments in aircraft.
The Group requires subsidiaries to identify and appropriately hedge all trading exposures in line with established policies.
The Group uses currency forwards, currency swaps and plain vanilla currency options to manage currency risks and these are usually designated as cash ow hedges of forecast future transactions.
Fuel price risk Exposure to fuel price risk arises due to ying costs for the Groups aircraft.
Commodity derivatives are entered into to manage the risk of adverse changes in the price of fuel.
The Groups policy is to hedge a minimum of 80% of the fuel requirement for the ight schedule concerned, with a maximum hedge tenor of 24 months prior to consumption.
Hedging is implemented with a combination of xed price contracts swaps and net purchased options and are usually designated as cash ow hedges.
The market risks that the Group is subject to have been identi ed as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and fuel price risk.
The impact of reasonably possible changes in these risk variables on the Group, based on the period end holdings of financial instruments have been calculated and are set out in the tables below.
In each case it has been assumed that all other variables remain constant.
As at 30 September 2010, the sensitivity of these risks to the fide ned scenario changes are set out below: Interest rate risk 2010 2009 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on pro t before tax equity pro t before tax equity m m m m 1% 2009: 1% increase in interest rates 4.6 2.2 0.25% 2009: 0.25% decrease in interest rates 1.1 0.5 106 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 TH017 Accounts p73-130.

As a result, liquidity is at its lowest in the winter months and at its highest in the summer months.
The Group manages the seasonal nature of its liquidity by making use of its bank revolving credit facility.
Short-term liquidity is primarily invested in bank deposits.
Financial liabilities are analysed below based on the time between the period end and their contractual maturity.
The amounts shown are estimates of the undiscounted future cash ows and will differ from both carrying value and fair value.

These cash ows include amounts in respect of fuel derivatives which are based on the year end fair values.
Estimated cash ows relating to fuel option derivatives have all been reported in the amount due in less than three months category.
Trade and other payables include nonfinancial liabilities of 208.2m 2009: 186.8m which have not been analysed above.
Counterparty credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to deposits, derivatives with a positive fair value and trade and other receivables.
The maximum exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is their carrying value.
The Group assesses its counterparty exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts and undrawn credit facilities.
The Group uses published credit ratings, credit default swap prices and share price performance in the previous 30-day period to assess counterparty strength and therefore to fide ne the credit limit for each counterparty.
The Groups approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in Note 17.

indd 107 107 21 12 2010 21 12 2010 22:50 22:50 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Insurance Management of insurance risk Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland Limited, issues contracts that transfer signi cant insurance risk and that are classi ed as insurance contracts.
As a general guideline, the Group fide fines as signi cant insurance risk, the possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a speci ed uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
Business written includes standard commercial risks for the Group and travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume.
Underwriting performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract.
Exposure is capped by speci c limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits.
Commercial policies with the Group are subject to policy excesses and single event and aggregate limits.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Groups past development pattern.
This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments.
The Group also uses an independent actuary to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate.
Any changes to these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the White Horse Insurance Ireland Ltd Board of Directors which ensures that reinsurers have a financial stability rating of B A M Best or above.
The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the Groups exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: Restated 2010 2009 m m Deferred tax liabilities 88.2 110.0 Deferred tax assets 383.2 433.5 295.0 323.3 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 1,820m 2009: 1,441m available for offset against future pro ts.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised where there is suf cient probability that there will be future taxable pro ts against which the assets may be recovered.
The increase in recognised tax losses in the year relates to non-recurring exceptional costs.
The UK and German businesses generated taxable pro ts before exceptional items which support the recognition of losses in these territories.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of 888.2m 2009: 679.9m due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Other temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying tax assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available, and fair value accounting on properties acquired as part of the merger.
In addition, the Group had unused other temporary differences in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised amounting to 186.1m 2009: 59.0m, also due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets where both items fell within the responsibility of the same tax authority.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end, without taking into consideration the offsetting balances within the same jurisdiction are 458.9m and 163.9m respectively.
The Finance Act 2009 introduced new rules in relation to the UK taxation of dividend income.
Under the new rules, no UK tax liability is expected to arise on the dividend income from undistributed pro ts of subsidiaries.
The new rules were effective from 1 July 2009.
As a result, no deferred tax liability is expected on the undistributed pro ts of subsidiaries at the balance sheet date 2009: nil.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
The Finance No 2 Act 2010 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011 and the effect of this change has been to reduce the deferred tax assets by 8.6m as at 30 September 2010.
The proposed reduction of the main rate of corporation tax in the UK by 1% per year to 24% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 27% to 24%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 September 2010, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by approximately 25.2m.

This expenditure arises at different times over the life of the aircraft with major overhauls typically occurring between two and ten years see accounting policies for more details.
Other provisions relate to provisions for off-market leases, onerous contracts, deferred and contingent consideration and future obligations, including those arising as a result of reorganisation and restructuring plans that are irrevocably committed, including severance payments and provisions for social security compensation plans.
Provisions included in non-current liabilities are principally off-market lease provisions, that are expected to be utilised over the term of those contracts which extend up to ten years from the balance sheet date, and deferred and contingent consideration arising on acquisitions.
During the year, 22.1m of deferred and contingent consideration on the Gold Medal acquisition was converted to a loan note, and has accordingly been reclassi ed to borrowings.
The unused amounts released in the year of 31.0m includes 11.7m of maintenance reserves in Northern Europe following the acquisition of two aircraft which were previously accounted for as operating leases.
This release has been treated as an exceptional item in the income statement.
27 Non-current assets classi ed as held for sale In the prior year the Group gained legal title to a hotel property in Mexico as settlement of an outstanding loan for CAD 16.6m.
The carrying amount at 30 September 2010 is 10.5m 2009: 9.1m.
This property is being actively marketed for sale and is expected to be disposed of within the next financial year and has therefore been classi ed as held for sale.

35 Retirement bene t schemes Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of fide ned contribution plans and fide ned bene t plans, with the fide ned bene t plans being both funded and unfunded.
The obligations arising from fide ned contribution plans are satis ed by contribution payments to both private and state-run insurance providers.
Unfunded fide ned bene t pension obligations Unfunded fide ned bene t pension obligations primarily relate to the Groups employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the Condor Group.
Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling 205.6m 2009: 179.0m were attributable to the pension commitments of the Condor Group Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Condor Berlin GmbH.
For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a company pension scheme.
The ight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their inight employment and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension.
In both cases, the bene t commitment depended on the final salaries of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their inight employment final salary plan.
Employees who joined a Condor Group company from 1995 onwards participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those employees average salary plan.
The Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional provisions.
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classi ed as unfunded fide ned bene t obligations and classi ed as such in these financial statements.
The Condor Group fide ned bene t plans have been closed to new entrants with the exception of pilots since 2004.
There are additional unfunded fide ned bene t obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and obligations in respect of past service for employees in Sweden.
The unfunded pension schemes are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement bene t obligations in the balance sheet.

These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 22.9 years for men and 27.4 years for women.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of these fide ned bene t schemes are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Current service cost 8.1 7.1 Curtailment gain 2.0 0.9 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 11.4 11.2 Total included in income statement 17.5 17.4 Service costs and curtailment gains have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement bene t obligations has been included in finance costs.

Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of quali ed actuaries in each country.
The fair value of the pension assets in each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement bene t obligations and the net difference reported as a pension asset or retirement bene t obligation as appropriate.
Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
Funded fide ned bene t pension obligations have been determined on the basis of assumptions relevant to each country.
The weighted averages of these were: 2010 2009 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.97% 5.49% In ation rate 3.20% 3.48% Expected return on scheme assets 6.07% 6.53% Expected rate of salary increases 4.68% 4.72% Future pension increases 3.20% 3.48% The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan accounts for approximately 97% 2009: 98% of the total funded fide ned bene t obligations.
The mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2010 are based on PXA92 year of birth tables with medium cohort improvements and a minimum future longevity improvement per year of 1%, adjusted for recent mortality experience.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 27.5 years for men and 28.8 years for women.
The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2003.
Employees who have joined since that date participate in a new fide ned contribution scheme.

The Co-operative Travel On 8 October 2010, the Group announced that it will merge its UK high street travel agency and foreign exchange business with that of The Co-operative Group.
On 29 October 2010, the Group signed an agreement under which Midlands Co-operative Society will also contribute its travel agency business.
The Group will hold 66.5% of the new company, The Co-operative Group will hold 30% and Midlands Co-operative Society will hold 3.5%.

Joint venture in Russia On 25 November 2010, Thomas Cook announced that it had reached agreement to form a joint venture with VAO Intourist, one of Russias most renowned travel companies.
Thomas Cook will initially acquire a 50.1% stake in the new joint venture company for a maximum consideration of US$45m subject to an adjustment for net debt and working capital.
The initial consideration will be satis ed by a cash payment of US$10m, and by the issue of US$35m of Thomas Cook shares.
The joint venture will include Intourists outbound, domestic and inbound tour operating operations as well as its travel retail network.
The joint venture provides Thomas Cook with an entry into the fast-growing Russian market which has strong demand for beach and family holidays, particularly to Turkey and Egypt.
The joint venture is conditional upon anti-trust clearance in Russia and certain other conditions and is expected to complete in, or before, February 2011.
Given the timing of the completion of this deal, it is not practical to provide a breakdown of the net assets to be acquired.
Aircraft eet replacement Thomas Cook Group operates a eet of 93 aircraft with an average age of 12 years.
The Group has identi ed signi cant operational savings, particularly from maintenance and improved fuel ef ciency, that can be achieved by renewing and harmonising its 71 narrow body aircraft into a common eet.
Following a comprehensive review, the Group has selected the Airbus 320 family of aircraft.
Accordingly, the Group will begin a five year narrow body aircraft replacement programme, starting in December 2012 and phased in line with the planned retirement of the existing eet.
The replacement programme will deliver optimum exibility by sourcing new narrow body aircraft through a combination of rm and exible orders direct with the manufacturer and through accessing the aircraft leasing market.
A review of the wide body eet replacement requirements will be undertaken during the 2010 11 financial year.
As part of the replacement programme, the Group has reached a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 12 new Airbus 321 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2014, with a list price of $96 million each, together with options to purchase further aircraft from 2015.
These aircraft are subject to substantial price concessions from the list price.
The Group will remain a heavy user of operating leases and it is anticipated that directly purchased aircraft will be nanced through sale and leaseback agreements with third-party lessors.
