74 St Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report 2010 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 30th November 2010 18.
PeNSIONS The Group operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1st September 2009, is also closed to future accrual.
The income statement includes: a charge of 0.1m 2009: 0.5m credit for the defined benefit section, incorporating a curtailment gain of nil 2009: 0.7m : and a charge of 0.1m 2009: 0.4m for the defined contribution section.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5th April 2008, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 32.9m, a funding level of 104%.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Credit Method under IAS19.
The main actuarial assumptions were: Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 6.3% p. a. post-retirement 4.8% p. a.
Increase in pensions 3.6% p. a. Capped to 5.6% for certain members.
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30th November 2010 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2010 2009 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.8% 3.6% 2.8% Rate of increase in pensions in payment Pre 6th April 1997 benefits 3.0% 3.0% 2.8% Post 5th April 1997 benefits 3.5% 3.6% 2.8% Discount rate 5.5% 5.5% 6.2% Inflation assumption 2.8% 3.6% 2.8% Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is no longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31st August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
The mortality rates adopted are from the PA92 year of birth and medium cohort tables which assume that, for example, male members who are currently retired are expected to draw their pensions for 26.8 years and non retired members for 27.7 years, based on the normal retirement age of 60.
The Group expects to make contributions of 0.2m to the defined benefit section of the scheme in 2011 and in future years.
The fair values of assets in the defined benefit section of the scheme and the expected rates of return, based on market expectations, were: 2010 2009 2008 % m % m % m Equities 5.7 10.3 5.6 17.0 5.9 13.3 Bonds 5.5 7.6 5.4 1.4 7.2 0.5 Property 5.7 8.5 5.6 8.4 5.9 9.9 Cash and other assets 4.2 0.8 4.1 0.3 4.4 1.2 27.2 27.1 24.9 Actuarial value of liabilities 24.7 26.9 23.6 Unrecognised surplus 2.5 0.2 1.3 Surplus in the scheme Related deferred tax liability Fair value of pension asset net of deferred tax The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses before unrecognised surplus of 2.5m recorded in the Group statement of recognised income and expense is a gain of 0.2m 2009: 2.0m loss.
