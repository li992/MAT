These amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Additions include $1,450 million in relation to the acquisition of a 50% stake in Blocks 1 and 3A in Uganda 2009: $nil, 2008: $nil and capitalised interest of $30.7 million 2009: $17.5 million, 2008: $nil million.
The Group only capitalises interest in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets where it is considered that development is highly likely and advanced appraisal and development is ongoing.
In 2008 amounts written off included an impairment charge calculated in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets of $111.5 million, determined by estimating value in use.
The impairment resulted from lower reserves estimates following a change in the most likely development plans and lower assumed oil prices following the fall in oil prices in the second half of 2008.
In calculating this impairment, management used a range of assumptions, including a long-term oil price of $80 per barrel and a 15% pre-tax discount rate.
