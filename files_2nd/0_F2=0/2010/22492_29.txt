Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Fair values of all financial instruments are obtained from independent open market sources, independent professional valuers, discounted cash flow models based on prevailing market rates or option pricing models.
Where a valuation model is used to determine fair value, it makes maximum use of market inputs.
Effective interest rate The EIR method applies a rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts relating to a financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
The estimated future cash flows take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts but not future credit losses.
At least annually, models are reviewed to assess expected lives of groups of assets based upon actual repayment profiles.
Goodwill impairment The directors review goodwill for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that impairment may have taken place.
The recoverable amounts of relevant cash generating units CGUs are based on value in use calculations using managements best estimate of future cash flows and performance, discounted at an appropriate rate which the directors estimate to be the return appropriate to the business.
Hedge accounting In designating a financial instrument as part of a qualifying hedge relationship, the directors have determined that the hedge is expected to be highly effective over the life of the hedging instrument.
In accounting for a derivative as a cash flow hedge, the directors have determined that the future cash flows of the hedged exposure are highly probable.
The group is required to assess on an ongoing basis whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
If a hedge was deemed partially ineffective but continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the amount of the ineffectiveness, taking into account the timing of the expected cash flows where relevant, would be recorded in the income statement.
If the hedge is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective the group discontinues hedge accounting.
Share-based awards The cost of the groups long-term equity based incentive schemes are determined using commonly accepted valuation techniques.
Fair values for market-based performance conditions use models which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
For non market-based performance conditions, vesting conditions are not taken into account when measuring fair value, but are reflected by adjusting the number of shares in each award such that the amount recognised reflects the number that are expected to, and then actually do, vest.
Details of the above variables can be found in note 31.
