TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 31 March 31 March 2010 2009 000 000 Trade receivables 1,796 1,546 Other receivables 1,592 154 Prepayments and accrued income 7,709 6,662 11,097 8,362 Trade receivables are net of a bad debt provision of 29,000 2009: 21,000.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The other receivables balance has increased since the prior year due to a deferred consideration of 1.2 million on the sale of surplus land at our site in Twickenham.
This amount falls due in October 2010.
Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
All customers are required to pay in advance of the storage period.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed by the customer.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that all customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from between 1 weeks to 4 weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 161,000 2009: 155,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group holds a right of lien over the customers goods if these debts are not paid.
The average age of these receivables is 36 days past due 2009: 25 days past due.
