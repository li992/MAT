the fair value of the sAYe and LtiP equity settled options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black-scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
the following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 march 2010 and 31 march 2009.

the expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
the initial fair value of LtiP options is adjusted to take into account the market-based performance condition.
Pensions schemes Defined benefit pension scheme the Group acquired a defined benefit final salary pension scheme during the year, which is funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
the scheme was closed to new members and future accrual on 30 June 2004.
Pension costs are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
the latest available formal actuarial valuations of the schemes were carried out as at 1 January 2007, with the 1 January 2010 valuation currently in progress.
these valuations were updated to the year end.
Plan assets are stated at fair value at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of scheme assets.
