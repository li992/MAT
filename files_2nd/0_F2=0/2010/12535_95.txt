Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Further information relating to the going concern assumption is provided in the Financial Review.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997.
The company accounts for pension costs in line with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefit scheme are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year-end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements as the cash flows of the company have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc.
Related party transactions The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures with regard to the non-disclosure of transactions between group companies.
Share-based payments The company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The main assumptions are provided in note 10.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based payments.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 101 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Sales revenue Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax.
The exception to this is that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Fixed assets Oil and gas assets a Development and production assets Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
b Impairment of development and production assets An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
c Decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related oil and gas property.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is dealt with prospectively as an adjustment to the provision and the oil and gas property.
The unwinding of the discount is included as a finance cost.
Stock and underlift Non-production related stocks are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Under and overlifts of crude oil are recorded at market value.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 102 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The company accounts for derivative financial instruments in line with FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The company uses derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its exposure to oil price fluctuations.
All derivatives are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs.
Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value.
All changes in fair value are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arms length transaction.
It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Profit for the year As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
The company reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2010 of US$7.4 million 2009: profit of US$23.1 million.
The auditors remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment Oil and gas properties North Sea 2010 2009 $ million $ million Cost: At 1 January 96.0 Additions during the year 0.9 Disposals during the year 96.9 At 31 December Amortisation and depreciation: At 1 January 29.9 Charge for the year 6.1 Disposals during the year 36.0 At 31 December Net book value: At 1 January 66.1 At 31 December Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
On 30 June 2009, the companys interest in the Kyle field was transferred to another group company.

The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits incorporating the amendment announced in December 2006.
The Schemes assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 105 8.
Pension liability continued The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2010.
The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2010, contributions are payable to the Scheme at the rates set out in the schedule of contributions dated 26 September 2008.
Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 25 per cent of the aggregate of members pensionable salaries.
Principal assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date were: At 31 December 2010 At 31 December 2009 Discount rate 5.4% pa 5.6% pa Expected return on Scheme assets 5.7% pa 4.9% pa Revaluation of deferred pensions 3.2% pa 3.7% pa Rate of increase in salaries 5.7% pa 5.7% pa Rate of increase in pensions in payment: LPI max 5.0% 3.7% pa 3.7% pa Withdrawals No allowance No allowance Cash commutation 1.0 x pre-commutation 1.0 x pre-commutation pension pension Life expectancy of male aged 65 now 23.8 23.7 Life expectancy of male aged 65 in 20 years 25.9 25.8 Life expectancy of female aged 65 now 26.3 26.2 Life expectancy of female aged 65 in 20 years 28.2 28.1 The pre and post-retirement mortality base table used for the Scheme in 2010 and 2009 is PCA00 YOB LC minimum 1.0 per cent improvements.
On 8 July 2010, the UK Government announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI would henceforth become the inflation measure used for statutory defined benefit pension increases.
Previously the Retail Price Index RPI had been used for this purpose.
The Trustee of the Scheme decided to continue to use RPI for increases to pensions in payment.
However, CPI rather than RPI should be used for the revaluation of deferred pensions.
The effect of the change to CPI in the actuarial assumptions has had the effect of reducing the liabilities on the year-end basis by US$0.6 million.
Asset breakdown The major categories of Scheme assets as a percentage of total Scheme assets are: At 31 At 31 December December 2010 2009 Equities 49.7% 37.3% Gilts 24.8% 26.0% Corporate bonds 23.6% 18.7% Cash 1.9% 18.0% Total 100.0% 100.0% Employee benefit obligations The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: At 31 At 31 December December 2010 2009 $ million $ million Fair value of Scheme assets 28.2 25.6 Present value of funded obligations 32.3 31.2 Deficit 4.1 5.6 Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 106 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 8.

Pension liability continued Projected profit loss recognition to 31 December 2011: Due to the significant volatility in investment markets, it is difficult to project forward the FRS 17 figures for the next year with confidence.
The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2010 is 5.7 per cent pa: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2011 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the profit and loss account are: 2011 $ million Current service cost 0.2 Interest on obligation 1.7 Expected return on Scheme assets 1.6 Total 0.3 Sensitivity and risk The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used.
The balance sheet position revealed by FRS 17 calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets with a significant exposure to equities is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields.
As at 31 December 2010, a one percentage point change in this assumption would have had the following effects on the closing defined benefit obligation: Discount rate: 5.4% pa Discount rate: Discount rate: as used for report 4.4% pa 6.4% pa $ million $ million $ million Defined benefit obligation 32.3 38.6 27.0 The key risks which could significantly impact the balance sheet, and to a lesser extent the profit and loss account, are as follows: falls in asset values which are not offset by a rise in the discount rate used to value liabilities: a reduction in the discount rate, which will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities: an increase in price inflation and or salary inflation: and improving life expectation lower mortality rates resulting in benefits being paid for longer.
Unfunded pensions The company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2010 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2009: US$0.9 million.
Commitments and guarantees At the year-end date the company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, had jointly guaranteed the groups borrowing facilities consisting of a US$175.0 million term loan and a NOK 100.0 million US$17.2 million Exploration Financing Facility, both maturing in 2012, and a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$456.8 million revolving credit facility and a 399.5 million US$623.2 million letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015.

Under the proposal, the company offered its shareholders the opportunity to acquire four new Ordinary Shares for every nine Ordinary Shares held at a price of 485 pence per new Ordinary Share.
The proposal was subject to authorisation by shareholders which was obtained at a General Meeting held on 20 April 2009.
The offer period commenced on 21 April 2009 and closed for acceptance on 6 May 2009.
Dealing in the new shares began on 7 May 2009.
Share-based payments 11,423 US$16,988 of Ordinary Shares were issued during 2010 relating to the companys share option plans 2009: 12,113 US$19,651.
In addition, 1,700,000 Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of 850,000 US$1,327,955 were issued to the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust to be used to satisfy future awards under the companys long-term incentive arrangements 2009: nil.
Share option plans The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the companys shares have been granted to certain executives and employees.
Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will lapse on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.

Share capital continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 14.28.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2010 had a weighted average exercise price of 8.33 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.0 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The company recognised a cost of US$52.7 million and US$27.3 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 31.5% Risk free rate of interest: 4.4% Historic market value growth factor: 109.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
The Asset and Equity Plan expired in 2009 and the award granted in 2008, which matured at the end of 2010, is the last award remaining under the plan.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 40.0% to 41.0% Risk free rate of interest: 3.3% to 3.7% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29 to 0.30 For the year ended 31 December 2010, the total cost recognised by the company for long-term incentive arrangements is US$18.0 million 2009: US$26.0 million, with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$nil 2009: US$11.1 million.
A credit of US$52.7 million has been recorded in the profit and loss reserve 2009: US$27.3 million for all equity-settled payments of the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the profit and loss account as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
