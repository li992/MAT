Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board delegates the establishment and implementation of the systems for internal control and risk management to the operating Divisions, which are responsible for the identification and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their area of business together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls.
The Board delegates the monitoring and review of the internal control and risk management systems to the Audit Committee assisted by the Risk Management Committee.
The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, reviews the full range of risks faced by Morgan Crucible as a Group, ensures there are adequate systems in place and evaluates their effectiveness.
Where necessary, the Risk Management Committee will initiate action to improve the systems and ensure compliance.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Group has set up notional cash pooling agreements with a number of banks.
Under the notional cash pooling agreement the Group has the legal right to offset liabilities on undrawn bank accounts against surplus balances.

Financial risk management continued Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers.
Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
Others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supplies.
The Groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, although the top 20 ranking will alter from year to year, many of the names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a general loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The general loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 m m Available for sale financial assets 5.6 5.7 Loans and receivables 160.7 144.5 Cash and cash equivalents 85.0 107.6 251.3 257.8 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by Division was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 m m Morgan AM&T 54.5 53.1 Molten Metal Systems 5.9 5.0 Technical Ceramics 31.1 25.9 Thermal Ceramics 69.2 60.5 160.7 144.5 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 m m Europe 66.0 67.5 Americas 50.8 44.3 Far East and Australasia 40.3 28.7 Middle East and Africa 3.6 4.0 160.7 144.5 122 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2010 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 19.

As at 2 January 2011 and 3 January 2010 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the Group.
In addition, local management may create a general impairment allowance to reflect their experience of the historical recoverability of trade receivables past due in the respective markets in which their businesses operate.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Concentrations of credit risk Trade receivables from one customer of the Groups Morgan AM&T operating segment represent 4.0 million of the Groups total trade receivables 2009: 9.9 million.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet all foreseeable needs.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Risk Management Committee.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk Profile At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 m m Fixed rate instruments Financial liabilities 298.5 250.8 Variable rate instruments Financial assets 85.0 107.6 Financial liabilities 22.7 109.5 62.3 1.9 The average cost of the Groups fixed rate debt is 5.7% 2009: 6.4%.

Financial risk management continued Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments A change of 100 basis points in interest rates on the Groups net debt at the reporting date would have increased decreased profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2009.

Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.

At any point in time the Group also hedges up to 75% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales and purchases over the following 12 months.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
Forecasted transactions The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 2 January 2011 was a gain of 0.3 million 2009: loss of 0.4 million, comprising assets of 0.4 million 2009: 0.1 million and liabilities of 0.1 million 2009: 0.5 million that were recognised in fair value derivatives.
Cash flow hedges The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
126 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2010 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 19.
Financial risk management continued Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Group manages the translation exposure of overseas net assets by seeking to match the currency of borrowings with the currency in which the net assets are denominated.
The objectives are to maintain a low cost of borrowing, whilst maintaining a balanced portfolio of net assets by currency.
The Group enters into forward contracts to hedge net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
The Group also designates the euro drawdowns under the 180 million multi-currency revolving credit facility as a hedge of the Groups investment in subsidiaries in Europe.
Euro drawdowns during the year amounted to 20.0 million 2009: 43.5 million.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 2 January 2011 is set out in the table below.
The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered to be a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 2 January 2011, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.

Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available for sale equity securities held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded defined benefit obligations.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base total equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators KPI, to ensure the continued success of the Group.
The main KPI for the Group is the underlying profit margin.
The aim is to achieve mid-teen margins in good times and double-digit margins when the environment is more challenging.
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Companys Ordinary shares.
The Group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups various share option incentive schemes.
The Company may also acquire its own shares under a share buy-back programme.

Financial risk management continued Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the preceding table.
Equity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings and finance leases are as follows: 2010 2009 Loans and borrowings 2.5-5.3% 2.7-6.3% Finance leases 6.0% 6.0% Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
