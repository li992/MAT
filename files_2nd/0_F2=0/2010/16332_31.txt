Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to accounts Group 31 December 2010 1 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating segments Aircraft & Vehicle Systems, Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and market characteristics.

Revenue by destination The following table provides an analysis of the Groups sales by geographical market.
Sales to this customer in 2010 were 203m 2009: 198m.
The prior year segmented analysis has therefore been re-stated to reflect this change and to ensure that the presentation is on a consistent basis.
2 Additional performance measures To present the headline profitability of the Group on a consistent basis year on year, additional performance indicators have been used.
These are calculated as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Profit from operations 90,015 76,036 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 20,331 26,303 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment net of property-related provisions - 5,009 Headline operating profit 110,346 97,330 Profit before tax 91,309 107,898 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 20,331 26,303 Profit on fair value movements on derivatives 8,952 55,630 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment net of property-related provisions - 5,009 Loss on closing out foreign currency hedging contracts - 15,924 Headline profit before tax 102,688 89,486 Cash generated by operations see note 28 122,847 120,944 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 15,526 10,042 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 3,813 3,062 Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 3,214 2,352 Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares 1,569 - Operating cash flow 106,351 111,612 Headline operating profit has been shown before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, this charge has been excluded from headline operating profit.
In addition during 2009, headline operating profit was stated before the profit on the disposal of property, plant and equipment net of property-related provisions, which included the net profit recognised on the disposal of the Armitage Road, Rugeley property and was after deducting a dilapidations provision relating to a number of properties.
Headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 were also presented before these adjustments.
Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 2 Additional performance measures continued IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates.
During 2009, the Group reviewed its level of hedging cover for the following years and reduced it to match the expected net inflow of US dollars.
In doing so, during 2009, the Group incurred one-off costs of 15.9m associated with closing out the hedging contracts.
These costs do not affect the underlying operating performance of the Group.
Headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 are stated before changes in the valuation of foreign currency derivative instruments and the costs associated with the reduction in the level of hedging cover.
The Group is cash generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an understatement of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

72 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These consist of the Groups operating businesses.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as set out below: 2010 2009 000 000 Dascam 7,731 8,804 Electrics 9,117 9,117 Adaptive Materials Inc 17,053 - Other 14,274 12,992 Aircraft & Vehicle Systems 48,175 30,913 Airport Systems 28,028 27,803 Command & Control Systems 16,542 16,542 NSPI 11,900 11,666 ProLogic 28,682 28,084 Other 7,823 6,101 Information & Power Systems 92,975 90,196 DNE Technologies 17,584 17,053 Maritime Systems 11,886 13,770 Tactical Communication Systems 19,411 19,402 UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc 18,479 18,353 Other 22,980 22,025 Tactical & Sonar Systems 90,340 90,603 Total Ultra Electronics 231,490 211,712 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the year.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows beyond this period are then extrapolated using a growth rate of nil per cent.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross margins.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The pre-tax discount rate used for all CGUs is 8.7%.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plan and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historic experience, available government spending data and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets that each CGU operates in.
Longer term growth rates, applied after the end of the strategic planning period, are conservatively set at nil per cent.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, but also factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on these calculations and shows that the discount rate would have to nearly double to 17%, with all other factors held constant, for an impairment loss to be recognised.
Management therefore believes that no reasonable change in the key assumptions used would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.

All trade receivables that have been overdue for more than a year are provided for in full.
Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 1,112 1,908 Foreign exchange differences 8 40 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 586 70 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 745 826 Balance at end of year 961 1,112 Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The Group has only one customer that individually accounted for greater than 10% of sales.
This customer is considered to have low credit risk.

Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small club of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were two facilities in place: one which was renewed in 2010, provides 120 million of revolving credit and expires in September 2013, and a second which was put in place in 2008, providing a further 80 million of revolving credit which was due to expire in September 2011.
Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
On 28 January 2011 the 80 million facility was replaced by a 90 million facility which expires in January 2016.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 0.85% 2009: 0.375% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had available 148,819,000 2009: 129,203,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities: Within 1 to 2 to Over 1year 2years 5years 5years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2010 Bank loans and overdrafts 52,895 - - - 52,895 Finance leases 136 22 66 111 335 Trade payables 70,566 - - - 70,566 Currency derivatives used for hedging 1,793 436 6 - 2,235 Deferred consideration 12,957 9,930 5,042 - 27,929 Interest rate swaps used for hedging 1,618 - - - 1,618 Accruals 30,152 65 29 448 30,694 2009 Bank loans and overdrafts 73,150 - - - 73,150 Finance leases 5 - - - 5 Trade payables 54,877 - - - 54,877 Currency derivatives used for hedging 9,164 1,100 142 - 10,406 Deferred consideration 10,500 5,793 5,084 - 21,377 Interest rate swaps used for hedging - 2,829 - - 2,829 Accruals 22,887 63 22 315 23,287 Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
At 31 December 2010, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be an asset of approximately 4,448,000 2009: liability of 4,504,000, comprising 6,683,000 assets 2009: 5,902,000 and 2,235,000 liabilities 2009: 10,406,000.
The gain on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 8,952,000 2009: 55,630,000.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Interest rate risk During the year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps will mature in December 2011 and have fixed swap rates, including the bank margin, ranging from 4.40% to 4.78%.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR and Canadian dollar LIBOR.
At the year end the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US dollar 60 million 2009: US dollar 80 million and Canadian dollar 20 million 2009: Canadian dollar 20 million.
The interest rate swaps are designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value has been charged to equity.
At 31 December 2010, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 1,618,000 2009: 2,829,000.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was 2,224,000 and has been charged to interest cost in the year 2009: 1,759,000.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next year 2009: two years.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 2010 Cash and cash equivalents 0.18% 68,129 68,129 - - Unsecured bank loans: US dollar loan 4.78% 37,434 37,434 - - Canadian dollar loan 4.40% 12,558 12,558 - - Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 312 129 82 101 2009 Cash and cash equivalents 0.25% 41,809 41,809 - - Unsecured bank loans: Sterling loan 1.51% 4,692 4,692 - - US dollar loan 4.30% 49,542 49,542 - - Canadian dollar loan 3.93% 11,813 11,813 - - Euro loan 0.82% 4,442 4,442 - - Finance lease liabilities 6.25% 5 5 - - Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 81 7.
Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Market risk sensitivity analysis Currency risks The Group has estimated the change to the income statement and equity of a 10% and 25% strengthening or weakening of average actual and transactional currency rates applicable during the year and a 10% and 25% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable for valuing foreign exchange derivative instruments.
The Group has estimated the change to the income statement and equity of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2010.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 2.62 million 2009: 1.94 million relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
The lower rate of 27% has been used to calculate the deferred tax balances at 31 December 2010 as this rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date.
The UK government has also announced its intention to reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
These further proposed rate reductions had not been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in the financial statements.
The proposed reductions in the rate are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The main estimated impact on the balance sheet of the 1% annual reduction will be to reduce the deferred tax asset in respect of retirement benefit obligations by approximately 0.8m at each year end until 31 December 2013.

Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 26 Share capital and share options continued 4.
Long-Term Incentive Plan continued The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2008, 2009 and 2010 LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2010 Weighted average share price 13.39 12.58 12.76 n a Weighted average exercise price 11.76 12.67 12.84 n a Expected volatility % 26.3 23.5 24.4 n a Expected option life years 3.7 6.0 5.0 n a Risk free interest rate % 2.5 3.1 3.0 n a Expected dividends % 1.7 2.1 2.1 n a Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2009 Weighted average share price 12.53 11.75 11.58 10.21 Weighted average exercise price 10.82 11.66 11.59 n a Expected volatility % 24.9 21.0 22.0 17.4 Expected option life years 3.6 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk free interest rate % 3.3 4.1 3.7 4.2 Expected dividends % 1.8 1.7 1.8 1.4 Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2008, 2009 and 2010 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2010 2009 Exercise price n a n a Share price at grant 13.34 12.16 Expected option life years 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility % 28.3 26.6 Expected dividend yield % 0.0 0.0 Risk free interest rate % 2.7 3.2 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.

The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 4,337,000 2009: 3,935,000.
Defined benefit schemes The UK defined benefit scheme was actuarially assessed at 31 December 2010 using the projected unit method.
The Canadian defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2010 using the projected unit method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada UK Canada 2010 2010 2009 2009 Discount rate 5.5% 5.5% 5.8% 5.8% Inflation rate 3.3% 3.3% 3.5% 3.5% Expected rate of salary increases 4.3% 4.3% 4.75% 4.75% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 3.2% 3.2% 3.4% 3.4% Future pension increases post 6 4 08 2.4% n a 2.5% n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% reduction in the inflation assumption to 3.2% and a 0.1% increase in the discount rate to 5.6% would decrease the schemes liabilities by 1.9% and 1.9% respectively.
If the members were to experience the mortality of an individual one year older the scheme liabilities would drop by 2.3%.
In addition to the above assumptions, the assumptions regarding the cash commutation factors have been enhanced for the 2010 UK scheme valuation.
