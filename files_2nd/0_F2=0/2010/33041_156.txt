The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2010 Expiry of At 31 March m losses Restricted losses: Americas 284 2010-2029 Europe 1,719 2010-2025 Total restricted losses 2,003 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 3,278 No expiry Capital losses 23,439 No expiry Other 775 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 27,492 Total 29,495 At 31 March 2010, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 5.5bn 2009: 10.1bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.
