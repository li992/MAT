Each of these divisions is considered to be a reportable segment.
AMECs Chief Executive together with the senior management team constitute the chief operating decision maker and they regularly review the performance of these three divisions, as well as the Investments and other activities segment.
The Investments and other activities segment principally comprises the Incheon Bridge PPP project in Korea now in the operational phase, the Lancashire Waste PPP project under construction and the run-down of AMECs non-core North American construction activities.

As at 31 December 2010, the reduction in the rate to 27 per cent on 1 April 2011 has been substantively enacted.
However, the remaining reductions in the rate have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore the proposed changes are not reflected in the figures reported.
The decrease in the rate from 27 per cent to 24 per cent would reduce the balance sheet deferred tax asset by approximately 2.5 million and would reduce unrecognised deferred tax assets by approximately 1.5 million.
During the period to 2014, AMEC estimates that the effect of the proposed changes to income and equity would be a charge of 2.5 million to the income statement.

At the time of announcing the groups interim results in August 2010 a number of management team changes were made to emphasise the on-going focus on delivery across the three reportable segments, Natural Resources, Power & Process and Earth & Environmental.
The review of unamortised goodwill for indications of impairment by management is now performed against the three core segments being the lowest level of cash generating units CGU monitored for goodwill purposes.
This is consistent with the integration of acquisitions into the three segments in order to generate synergies.
Goodwill has been allocated between segments on a relative fair value basis.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two-year period and pre-tax discount rates as set out in the table below.
Given the current market conditions, management believe that the discount rates chosen are conservative.
For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the two-year period include two per cent growth per annum 2009: two per cent, which is in line with long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU and no impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of any of the CGUs.
The financial budgets are developed using an assumed workload and margin for the following year.
Workload is underpinned by a secured order book for each CGU, and order book remains strong at 3.1 billion 2009: 3.2 billion as at 31 December 2010.
The margin selected is based on managements review of the margins on orders received and from the results of Operational Excellence.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a one per cent decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any further impairments.
Similarly, zero growth after the initial two year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a one per cent increase in discount rate, did not identify any further material impairments.

Substantially all UK members are in funded defined benefit schemes, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined benefit schemes The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 1 April 2008 and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2010.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December 2010.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 5.4 5.7 Rate of inflation 3.4 3.6 Rate of increase in salaries 4.4 4.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment service before after 1 January 2008 3.4 2.4 3.6 2.4 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 7.7 7.9 Bonds 5.4 5.7 Gilts 4.2 4.4 Property 6.2 6.4 84 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 Introduction Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities continued For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy is as follows: Male Female years years Member aged 65 current life expectancy 21.4 23.7 Member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 23.3 25.5 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 5.89 per cent assumption as at 31 December 2010.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 million million Retirement benefit assets 63.0 26.8 Retirement benefit liabilities 35.9 30.9 Retirement benefit net assets liability 27.1 4.1 The retirement benefit liabilities of 35.9 million 2009: 30.9 million reflect primarily the deficits on the overseas schemes.

88 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 Introduction Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 15 Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued Factors affecting the tax charge in future years There are a number of factors that may affect the groups future tax charge including the resolution of open issues with tax authorities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought-forward losses and changes in tax legislation and tax rates.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 million million Deductible temporary differences 20.2 17.0 Tax losses 47.7 72.5 67.9 89.5 There are tax losses of 2.3 million arising in the US, all of which expire in 2024.
The other tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets.
In addition, claims have been made to HMRC to offset tax losses of up to 79.4 million against the groups UK taxable profits.
These losses were generated in a legacy German business in accounting periods up to 31 December 2002.
If successful, the claims will result in a refund of UK Corporation tax.
The amount of the refund depends on a number of factors which are currently being discussed with HMRC.
This potential refund is not included within unrecognised deferred tax assets in 2010 as the amount represents a potential refund of current tax.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 381.5 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be 19.0 million.

90 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 Introduction Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 19 Financial instruments Details of the groups financial risk management objectives and policies, together with its policies for hedging are provided in the managing risk section on pages 12 and 13.
Hedging of interest rate risk The group remained in a net cash position throughout the year.
As a result, long-term interest rate hedging for periods beyond three to six months is not considered appropriate.
Hedging of foreign currency risk cash flow hedges The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs, in non-local currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 2010 2009 2010 2009 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 12.8 22.3 0.1 0.8 Current liabilities 17.0 39.9 3.3 5.3 29.9 62.2 3.2 4.5 The following tables indicate the periods in which the cash flows associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur and the periods in which they are expected to impact profit or loss: 2010 Carrying Expected 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 amount cash flows or less months years years million million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 0.1 12.8 9.6 0.8 2.4 Liabilities 3.3 17.0 4.2 2.9 9.0 0.9 3.2 29.8 13.8 3.7 11.4 0.9 2009 Carrying Expected 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 amount cash flows or less months years years million million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 0.8 22.3 13.3 6.7 1.1 1.2 Liabilities 5.3 39.9 16.5 4.6 9.7 9.1 4.5 62.2 29.8 11.3 10.8 10.3 In 2010, 0.7 million 2009: charge of 0.3 million was transferred from the hedging reserve to cost of sales in the income statement.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are recognised through the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these forward contracts and swaps are as follows: 2010 2009 2010 2009 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 120.4 58.8 1.3 1.0 Current liabilities 36.3 11.2 2.3 0.2 156.7 70.0 1.0 0.8 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 91 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Financial instruments continued Hedging of foreign currency risk net investment hedges The group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps which have been designated as hedges of the net investments in subsidiaries in Canada and the US.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as net investment hedges are as follows: 2010 2009 2010 2009 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Non-current assets 22.3 22.3 1.4 1.4 Current liabilities 101.3 25.4 21.4 5.1 Non-current liabilities 142.9 148.6 12.4 22.3 266.5 196.3 32.4 26.0 A net foreign exchange loss for the year of 11.5 million 2009: gain of 11.6 million was recognised in the translation reserve in respect of these forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps.
The investment hedging policy was changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business.
As a result of this change in policy, existing hedging contracts will not be replaced as they mature.
In specific circumstances, for example the planned repatriation of foreign assets, the group may from time to time enter into new net investment hedges to manage foreign exchange risk.
Interest rate risk contractual maturity and effective interest rates In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature: 2010 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less Per cent million million Short-term investments 1.08 196.4 196.4 Cash and cash equivalents 0.55 543.7 543.7 740.1 740.1 2009 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less Per cent million million Short-term investments 0.59 130.7 130.7 Cash and cash equivalents 0.38 612.0 612.0 742.7 742.7 Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling.
It conducts business in a range of currencies, including Canadian and US dollars and currencies linked to the US dollar.
As a result, the group is exposed to foreign exchange risks, which will affect transaction costs and the translation results and value of underlying assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges its material transaction related exposures and hence has no material transactional profit or loss sensitivity.
With respect to translation exposure, the group does not hedge the profits generated in non-Sterling currencies but does hedge a proportion of assets denominated in foreign currencies.
A ten percent movement in Sterling Canadian dollar and Sterling US dollar rates results in a 25.2 million credit charge to other comprehensive income arising on net investment hedges.
92 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 Introduction Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 19 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.
The ageing of trade receivables at the year end was: Gross Gross receivables Impairment receivables Impairment 2010 2010 2009 2009 million million million million Not past due 182.2 0.6 177.6 1.0 Past due 0-30 days 78.2 0.3 45.7 0.2 Past due 31-120 days 29.3 1.4 23.7 1.2 Past due 121-365 days 13.0 3.1 12.5 6.5 More than one year 18.1 15.9 18.6 11.0 320.8 21.3 278.1 19.9 The above analysis excludes retentions relating to contracts in progress of 16.7 million 2009: 12.8 million expected to be recovered within one year and 2.3 million 2009: 8.9 million expected to be recovered after one year.
Net receivables as at 31 December 2010 include 2.2 million 2009: 7.6 million in respect of amounts overdue by more than one year.
The group believes there is no material exposure in respect of these balances.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2010 2009 million million As at 1 January 19.9 26.6 Exchange movements 1.7 0.4 Net impairment allowance credited 0.3 6.3 As at 31 December 21.3 19.9 Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government backed organisations, and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The groups most significant customer in 2010 accounted for around 22 per cent 2009: 15 per cent of continuing revenues, and the same percentage of current trade and other receivables.
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform under the contract.
AMEC manages these risks by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25-30 mainstream banks and with each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit.
These limits are set at prudent levels by the board, are based primarily on credit ratings set by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch and have been reviewed in light of the recent market turbulence.
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid over concentration of exposure to any one counterparty.
Fair values The carrying values of all financial instruments held at 31 December 2009 and 2010 equate to their fair values.
Fair values are determined using observable market prices level 2 as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures as follows: Trade and other receivables and payables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are valued at their amortised cost, which are deemed to reflect fair value.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 93 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Financial instruments continued The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
Capital management Capital includes convertible preference shares and equity attributable to the equity holders of the market.
The objective of the groups capital management is to ensure that it has strong financial policies, the ability to grow the business to exceed its Vision 2015 targets and is able to maximise shareholder value.
The appropriate capital structure for the group would comprise of a mix of debt and equity.
The mix will be determined by considering business profile and strategy, financial policies and availability and cost of funding.
Policies state that total borrowings should be less than two times adjusted capital and reserves.
However, the group is currently in a net cash position.
If debt is subsequently required, the long term net debt is expected to be less than two times EBITDA.
The company may exceed this operating parameter should the business profile require it.
However, it is expected that any increases would be temporary given the net operational cash flows of the group.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.

Major contingent liabilities are discussed in more detail in note 27.
The provision for indemnities relates to the indemnification of the purchasers of SPIE in 2006, purchasers of the Built Environment businesses and other peripheral businesses in 2007, and to the Wind Developments business which was sold in 2008.
94 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 Introduction Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 21 Provisions continued The insurance provision relates to the potential liabilities in the groups captive insurance entity and provisions in relation to risks associated with insurance claims.
These potential liabilities and risks relate predominantly to industrial disease of former employees.
Future outflows in respect of the onerous property contracts are expected to occur over the next several years.
Due to the nature of the other liabilities, the timing of any potential future outflows is uncertain.
Provision has been made for AMECs potential liability to fund loss-making joint venture entities.
22 Share capital and reserves Movements in share capital and reserves are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity on pages 62 and 63.
Reserves The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities and the cumulative net change in the fair value of instruments that hedge the companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The group has acquired 1,000,000 shares 2009: 855,349 during the year which are held in treasury.
During the year 468,814 shares 2009: 350,228 were transferred to share scheme participants leaving a balance held in treasury as at 31 December 2010 of 6,658,059 shares 2009: 6,126,873.
50.6 million 2009: 48.5 million has been deducted from equity in respect of these shares.
A qualifying share ownership trust the Quest was established on 26 August 1999.
The Quest holds shares issued by the company in connection with the savings related share option scheme.
There was no activity in the Quest during 2010 or 2009.
Share capital The authorised share capital of the company is 350.0 million 2009: 350.0 million.
This comprises 700 million 2009: 700 million ordinary shares of 50 pence each.
All the ordinary shares rank parri passu in all respects.
To the companys knowledge and belief, there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company or on voting rights between holders of shares.
As at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 the company had in issue 337,965,871 ordinary shares of 50 pence each.
The allotted, called up and fully paid ordinary share capital at these dates was 169.0 million.
Share-based payments Offers are made periodically in certain countries under the UK and International Savings Related Share Option Schemes which are open to all employees in those countries who meet minimum service criteria.
Grants of share options are made to participating employees that entitle them to buy shares in the company normally after three years at up to 20 per cent discount to the market price of the shares at the time of offer.
In the US, to conform with the relevant tax rules, options are granted at a maximum discount of 15 per cent to the share price at the time of grant and are normally exercisable after two years.
In certain countries, awards take the form of cash-settled stock appreciation rights.
Under the Performance Share Plan, annual awards are made to directors and selected senior employees of restricted shares that are subject to both market and non-market based conditions calculated over a three-year period.
During 2008, one-off awards were made under the Transformation Incentive Plan that are subject to non-market based conditions related to 2010 performance.
Detailed terms of these plans are included in the remuneration report on pages 48 to 58.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 95 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 22 Share capital and reserves continued The Company has a further scheme in place, the Executive Share Option Scheme.
AMECs policy is to grant share options under this scheme only selectively and in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment.
No awards have been made under this scheme since 2004.
The share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are predominantly equity-settled and, other than in defined good leaver circumstances, require participants to be still in employment with the group at the time of vesting.

Dividends The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2010 of 19.2 pence per share, which will absorb an estimated 63.0 million of equity.
Subject to approval, it will be paid on 1 July 2011 to shareholders on the register of members on 27 May 2011.
The dividend has not been provided for and there are no income tax consequences for the company.
This final dividend together with the interim dividend of 7.3 pence 2009: 6.1 pence per share results in a total dividend of 26.5 pence per share 2009: 17.7 pence.

98 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 Introduction Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 24 Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions in 2010 The following purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
None of the businesses acquired made a material contribution to consolidated revenue and profit in the period from their acquisition to 31 December 2010, nor would they have done in the year ended 31 December 2010 if they had been acquired on 1 January 2010.
Intangible assets recognised at fair value on the acquisition of these businesses included brands, trade names, customer relationships, order backlogs and non-compete agreements.
Currie & Brown Australia Pty Ltd On 29 January 2010, the group acquired all of the shares in Currie & Brown Australia Pty Ltd.
The name of this company was subsequently changed to Aquenta Consulting Pty Ltd Aquenta.
Aquenta trades almost entirely in Australia and is a provider of independent cost, contract and consulting services to the oil and gas, mining, building, transport, utilities and infrastructure sectors.
The business provides similar services to the existing AMEC subsidiary Rider Hunt International Ltd and was acquired to increase the size of the consultancy services business.
This is fully aligned with AMECs Vision 2015 strategy of assured growth, through a strengthened geographic footprint in key regions and enhanced capabilities in chosen sectors.
It builds on AMECs recent acquisition of GRD Minproc.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Aquenta were as follows: Recognised value million Property, plant and equipment 0.8 Intangible assets 2.1 Current tax receivable 0.2 Trade and other receivables 4.9 Cash and cash equivalents 1.7 Trade and other payables 7.3 Deferred tax liability 0.4 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 2.0 Goodwill on acquisition 15.6 17.6 Consideration Paid in cash on completion 17.6 Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Aquenta primarily due to its skilled workforce positioned within the strong Australian market which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets as at the dates of acquisition.
Entec Holdings Limited Entec On 29 March 2010, the group acquired all of the shares in Entec.
Entec is a UK-based environmental and engineering consultancy, and was acquired to provide opportunity for leadership positioning in the UK geographical area, particularly in the water services sector.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 99 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 24 Acquisitions and disposals continued The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Entec were as follows: Recognised value million Property, plant and equipment 1.3 Intangible assets 26.6 Trade and other receivables 14.4 Current tax receivables 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 1.0 Trade and other payables 11.2 Deferred tax liability 7.4 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 25.0 Goodwill on acquisition 42.6 67.6 Consideration: Cash paid on completion includes working capital adjustment of 0.4 million paid in August 2010 50.4 paid to repay debt 11.2 contingent 6.0 Costs of acquisition 67.6 In addition to the consideration set out above, up to a further 3.0 million is payable as deferred compensation depending upon continuing employment of three former shareholders for the one year following the acquisition date.
The contingent consideration of 6.0 million shown above is dependent upon achievement of a profit target for the year following the acquisition date.
The probability weighted outcome for deferred consideration is considered to be 6.0 million.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Entec primarily through the acquisition of Entecs expertise in various environmental fields, primarily water services, as well as expected synergies.
Other acquisitions A number of smaller acquisitions were made in the year for 9.2 million in cash paid on completion.
The aggregate fair value of identifiable net assets was 0.3 million including cash acquired of 0.6 million and goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 9.3 million.
The initial accounting for these acquisitions has been determined only provisionally.
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of their skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets at the dates of acquisition.
A further 8.7 million was paid in the year in respect of businesses acquired in 2009 and prior.
The aggregate goodwill on these acquisitions was reduced by 8.4 million as the conditions for payment of elements of the deferred consideration were not met.
Disposal in 2010 AGRA Foundations Limited AGRA Foundations Limited was sold to Freysinnet Menard Canada Inc FMC on 25 June 2010.

Net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations The net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations during the year were as follows: 2010 2009 million million Net cash flow from operating activities 8.2 1.9 Net cash flow from investing activities 3.5 7.0 11.7 8.9 Acquisitions in 2009 The following purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
Performance Improvements Group Limited PI On 26 January 2009, the group acquired all of the shares in PI.
PI is based in the UK and is an asset optimisation consultancy services company.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of PI were as follows: Fair value Recognised Book value adjustments value million million million Property, plant and equipment 0.3 0.2 0.1 Intangible assets 7.5 7.5 Trade and other receivables 4.8 4.8 Cash and cash equivalents 0.7 0.7 Trade and other payables 2.4 2.4 Deferred tax liability 2.1 2.1 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 2.0 5.2 7.2 Goodwill on acquisition 7.7 14.9 Consideration Cash paid on completion 12.8 deferred 1.7 Costs of acquisition 0.4 14.9 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 101 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 24 Acquisitions and disposals continued Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of PI primarily through the benefits gained from combining PIs performance improvement skills with AMECs project management and engineering expertise to enhance value for customers.
GRD Limited GRD On 17 November 2009, the group acquired all of the shares in GRD, an engineering and project development company based in Perth, Australia.
The initial amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities at the time of acquisition and the respective fair value adjustments relating to these were provisionally reported in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The acquisition accounting has been finalised in 2010 and the fair values have been updated as follows: Fair value Provisional adjustments Recognised Book value fair value identified in value adjustments current year restated million million million million Property, plant and equipment 3.4 1.0 2.4 Intangible assets 7.8 3.2 2.6 8.4 Interests in joint ventures 22.1 2.7 24.8 Deferred tax asset 15.3 8.6 1.6 8.3 Trade and other receivables 24.0 3.8 1.4 18.8 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5 0.5 Trade and other payables 15.9 6.3 5.4 27.6 Current tax liability 3.0 1.4 4.4 Provisions for liabilities and charges 1.8 21.6 23.4 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 55.4 16.8 55.6 17.0 Goodwill on acquisition 108.3 91.3 Cash consideration paid on completion 58.3 Repayment of debt on acquisition 30.4 88.7 Costs of acquisition 2.6 91.3 Finalisation of the acquisition accounting has resulted in a 55.6 million reduction in the fair values of the acquired net identifiable assets and liabilities and a corresponding increase in goodwill.
This reduction in the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities in the most part relates to the joint venture investments held by GRD at the time of acquisition.
This arises because the technical solutions associated with achieving service commencement of the associated project took longer than first anticipated: this delay was caused by circumstances which existed at the date of acquisition.
The time and cost impact of this delay is fully reflected in the reduction in fair value.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of GRD because of synergies expected to be obtained through the complementary fit of existing AMEC and GRD operations in Australasia, and GRDs skilled workforce and intellectual property which did not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as at the date of acquisition.
Other acquisitions A number of other smaller acquisitions were made in the year for 5.5 million in cash paid on completion.
A further 1.6 million of conditional consideration may be paid in respect of these acquisitions.
The aggregate fair value of identifiable net assets was 1.7 million including cash acquired of 0.2 million and goodwill arising on acquisitions was 5.4 million.
The aggregate book value of net assets acquired was 0.4 million.
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of their skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets as at the dates of acquisition.
A further 10.0 million was paid in the period in respect of 2008 acquisitions, and the aggregate goodwill on these acquisitions was reduced by 7.9 million as the conditions for payment of elements of the deferred consideration were not met.
102 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 Introduction Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 24 Acquisitions and disposals continued Disposals in 2009 During the year, two small businesses were sold.
In addition there were various cash payments in respect of businesses sold in prior years and adjustments to provisions held in respect of prior year disposals resulting in a net gain of 3.5 million and a net cash outflow of 6.2 million.
25 Capital commitments 2010 2009 million million Contracted but not provided for in the accounts As at 31 December 2010, there was no commitment to invest in PPP concessions 2009: 0.2 million.
26 Operating leases The total obligations under non-cancellable operating lease rentals for continuing operations are as follows: 2010 2009 million million In one year or less 54.6 51.9 Between one and five years 128.2 113.5 Over five years 56.3 35.5 239.1 200.9 AMEC enters into the following types of lease: short-term plant hires: leases for motor vehicles and office equipment with lease periods of two to five years: and longer term property leases.
None of the leases include any contingent rentals.
27 Contingent liabilities Guarantees and indemnities The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC.
Legal claims and actions AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified in this note.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
Provisions of 50.3 million 2009: 53.8 million are shown in note 21 in respect of these claims.
It is not practicable to quantify the remaining contingent liability because of the range of possible outcomes and the progress of the litigation.
As the matters below involve actions by third parties against AMEC, the timing of settlement cannot be determined although AMEC is endeavouring to settle as soon as practicable.
Due to the litigation, there is no work in progress or other receivable recognised in respect of these contracts.
Whilst AMEC believes that certain claims may be covered by insurance, it is not currently practicable to assess the extent to which AMECs insurance policies will respond in the event of a settlement.
AMEC Group Limited AGL is currently the subject of certain ongoing Health and Safety Executive investigations, in respect of separate incidents involving two separate fatalities to subcontractors at the Leftbank Apartments project in Manchester in April 2004 and April 2005.
Summons have been received in both cases.
AMEC has entered a not guilty plea in both cases.
The first case will be heard at Liverpool Crown Court in June 2011 and the second case will be heard at Manchester Crown Court in September 2011.
If AGL is found guilty and prosecuted for these cases, it could be liable to unlimited fines.
A prosecution for AGL in relation to fatal accidents in relatively quick succession could have an impact on the amount of any penalty.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2010 103 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 27 Contingent liabilities continued AGL has also received two summons with regard to an incident involving a fatality at the Aberthaw Power Station.
This accident occurred during work which was outside of AMECs undertaking and control and involved the death of a subcontractor of the client.
AMEC has entered a guilty plea for one of the charges and sentencing will occur in June 2011.
As the case will be heard in Crown Court, AGL are liable to unlimited fines.
It is considered improbable that any of these cases will result in a material liability for AGL.
28 Related party transactions During the year there were a number of transactions with the senior management group, joint venture entities and subsidiary companies.
