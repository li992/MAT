Investment property and investment property under development are carried at fair value.
Property under development of 113.0 million 2009: 38.1 million and Completed property of 105.1 million 2009: 204.1 million held in current assets are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, but their fair values have been determined as described below.
Following the formation of the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund it is likely that the fund will acquire the Groups future developments.
Hence properties acquired with the intention of selling them to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund following completion are treated as property under development in current assets carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, rather than fixed assets carried at fair value.
The impact if these properties were carried at fair value rather than cost is set out in the table below: Unite 69 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 7. investment and development property continued investment property Property investment under Completed under property development property development total 2010 m m m m m At 31 December 2010 375.7 105.1 113.0 593.8 Valuation gain not recognised on property held atcost brought forward 17.2 0.8 18.0 Disposals 12.9 12.9 Valuation gain not recognised in year 8.0 24.0 32.0 Fair value at 31 December 2010 375.7 117.4 137.8 630.9 Investment property Property Investment under Completed under property development property development Total 2009 m m m m m At 31 December 2009 403.6 204.1 38.1 645.8 Valuation gain not recognised on property held atcost brought forward 5.0 23.9 28.9 Transfer from property under development 13.4 13.4 Disposals 9.3 4.0 13.3 Valuation gain not recognised in year 8.1 5.7 2.4 Fair value at 31 December 2009 403.6 221.3 38.9 663.8 Included within investment properties are the following values in respect of leasehold interests: investment property Property investment under Completed under property development property development total 2010 m m m m m Valuation and net book value Long leasehold 44.5 44.5 Short leasehold 10.6 10.6 55.1 55.1 Investment property Property Investment under Completed under property development property development Total 2009 m m m m m Valuation and net book value Long leasehold 43.2 43.2 Short leasehold 10.4 10.4 53.6 53.6 The total interest included in investment and development properties at 31 December 2010 was 28.4 million 2009: 36.4 million.
