Production was particularly strong at the Companys two newest mines, Pallancata and San Jos, which now contribute approximately half of the Companys total attributable production, offset by 06 07 08 09 10 lower production at Arcata where the Company is moving towards mining reserve grades in order to achieve a consistent Attributable gold production and sustainable level of production.
144 koz koz The Company has announced a production target of 22.5 million attributable silver equivalent ounces for 2011, in line with its mid-term forecast of 2023 million attributable silver equivalent 201 196 ounces from current operations.
Management expects stable 157 153 144 production at San Jos and Pallancata, offset by lower production at Arcata, as the Company moves towards its longterm goal of mining close to the average reserve grade ateach of its core operations as anticipated in 2009.

Resource life of mine is based on resources of Hochschilds core operations and calculated by dividing the number of resource tonnes by the amount of ore forecast to be processed during the following 12 month period.

Questions to the CEO: You have signicantly increased yourresource life of mine in 2010, Resource life of San Jos doyouexpect this trend to continue Years 36% anddoyouhave a target?
11.4 This was one of the key priorities for the new management team and I am pleased to say that we have made real progress with resource life up 23% 8.4 in2010, including an impressive 36% increase at 6.2 5.9 SanJos where we made some significant new discoveries during 2010.
We are extremely confident 4.0 about the longevity of our three main operations and, though we do not have a specic target in terms of resource life, we would feel very comfortable with 1012 years of resources ahead of us.
