14 Earnings per share This note shows how we calculate earnings per share, based both on the present shares in issue the basic earnings per share and the potential future shares in issue, including conversion of share options granted to employees the diluted earnings per share.
We have also shown the same calculations based on our operating profit as we believe this gives a better indication of operating performance.
