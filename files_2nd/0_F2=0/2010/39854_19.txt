Segmental information The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for reviewing the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and the allocation of resources.
The Groups properties, which are all located in Londons West End, are managed as a single portfolio.
Its properties, which are of similar type, are combined into villages.
All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks.
For the purposes of IFRS 8, each Village is considered to be a separate operating segment.
However, in view of the similar characteristics of each Village, and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 have been applied to give one reportable operating segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable operating segment using measures of net property income and investment property valuation.
All financial information provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements and, as the Group has only one reportable segment, the reconciliation of the measures used in assessing the business to the reported results are set out in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Changes in the fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps, which are not held for speculative purposes, are reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as none of the Groups hedging arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The extent to which the fair value deficit will crystallise will depend on the course of interest rates over the life of the swaps, which had a weighted average maturity of 22.4 years 2009: 23.4 years at the balance sheet date.
2010 2009 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024 m m Fair value of liability in excess of book value not recognised in the reported results for the year: At 30 September - Deficit 13.6 10.8 The fair value of the outstanding Debenture Stock has been calculated by J. C. Rathbone Associates Limited at 217 basis points 2009: 217 basis points above the yield to redemption of the 5% Treasury Stock 2025 at the balance sheet date.
The Company is not obliged to redeem the 61.0 million nominal of Stock in issue in advance of its redemption date of 31 March 2024, when repayment of the stock in issue will be at par value.
Other financial instruments The fair values of the Groups and Companys cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings other than the 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024, finance leases and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.

Financial instruments continued Cash outflows attributable to financial instruments and interest-bearing borrowings Group The tables below summarise the Groups undiscounted contractual cash flows arising on financial instruments and financial liabilities based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
Management of financial risk Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash rental deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 16.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the Directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups bankers are listed on the inside back cover.
All The Group holds minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day to day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
Liquidity risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Business Review on pages 33 to 34.

Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long term fixed rate debt, long term committed bank facilities and the use of long term interest rate swaps on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
As described in the Business Review on pages 33 to 34, the Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
The Groups First Mortgage Debenture Stock carries a rate of interest of 8.5%, which is fixed until maturity in March 2024.
The Groups current bank facilities, which expire between April 2016 and March 2021, are at credit margins which are fixed for the life of the facilities.
At 30 September 2010, the actual average credit margin on the amounts drawn under those facilities was 0.76% 2009: 0.71%.
If those facilities had been fully drawn at that date, the average credit margin payable would have been 0.81% 2009: 0.81%.
The Group has in place interest rate swaps to hedge 360 million of floating rate bank debt, at fixed rates in the range 4.59% to 5.15%, with a weighted average rate at 30 September 2010 of 4.87%.
The swaps, which are settled against three month LIBOR, expire between December 2027 and November 2038 weighted average term 22.4 years.

Management of financial risk continued Interest rate sensitivity Based on indebtedness, interest rates and hedging in place at the year end, the impact of a change of 0.5% in market interest rates applicable to its LIBOR-linked borrowings and swaps and a change of 0.5% in the long term interest rates against which the fair value of swaps is calculated, would have the following impacts on the Groups results and equity: Movement in market rates Increase Reduction of 0.5% of 0.5% m m Increase decrease in finance costs before fair valuation of interest rate swaps 0.5 0.5 Decrease increase in fair value deficit of interest rate swaps 28.5 28.5 Increase decrease in profit and shareholders equity 28.0 28.0 This sensitivity analysis does not take account of the impact that long term interest rate movements could have on the valuation of the Groups investment properties, which would be reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, to provide returns to shareholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The current capital structure of the Group comprises a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the Group Balance Sheet.
Debt comprises long-term secured bank loans and Debenture stock.
