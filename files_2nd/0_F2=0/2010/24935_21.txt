Information on the scrip dividend scheme and currencies in which shareholders may elect to have the cash dividend paid will be sent to shareholders on or about 30 March 2011.
Interim dividends for 2011 The Board has adopted a policy of paying quarterly interim dividends on the ordinary shares.
Under this policy it is intended to have a pattern of three equal interim dividends with a variable fourth interim dividend.
It is envisaged that the first interim dividend in respect of 2011 will be US$0.09 per ordinary share.
Dividends are declared in US dollars and, at the election of the shareholder, paid in cash in one of, or in a combination of, US dollars, sterling and Hong Kong dollars, or, subject to the Boards determination that a scrip dividend is to be offered in respect of that dividend, may be satisfied in whole or in part by the issue of new shares in lieu of a cash dividend.
An informal meeting of shareholders will be held at 1 Queens Road Central, Hong Kong on Thursday, 19 May 2011 at 4.30pm.
2 A Vote Withheld is not a vote in law and is not counted in the calculation of the votes For and Against the resolution.
372 Interim Management Statements and Interim Results Interim Management Statements are expected to be issued on or around 12 May 2011 and 9 November 2011.
