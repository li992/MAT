Accordingly, the final ordinary equity share dividends set out above relate to the respective prior years.
The 2009 final dividend of 44.80 cents per ordinary share $904 million was paid to eligible shareholders on 13 May 2010 and the 2010 interim dividend of 23.35 cents per ordinary share $481 million was paid to eligible shareholders on 5 October 2010.
2010 recommended final ordinary equity share dividend The 2010 final ordinary equity share dividend recommended by the Board is 46.65 cents per share $1,089 million, which makes the total dividend for 2010 70.00 cents per share on a pre-rights basis 2009: 66.03 cents per share, 2008: 61.62 cents per share.
The final dividend will be paid in either pounds sterling, Hong Kong dollars or US dollars on 11 May 2011 to shareholders on the UK register of members at the close of business in the UK 10:00 pm London time on 11 March 2011, and to shareholders on the Hong Kong branch register of members at the opening of business in Hong Kong 9:00 am Hong Kong time on 11 March 2011.

Impact of the 2010 rights issue On 13 October 2010, the Company announced the issue of 260,525,763 new ordinary shares by way of rights to qualifying shareholders at 1,280 pence per new ordinary share.
The issue was on the basis of 1 ordinary share for every 8 ordinary shares held on 21 October 2010.
In the absence of specic guidance in IFRS, the dividend per share amounts in the table below have been adjusted for the bonus element included within the 2010 rights issue in line with the restatement of prior period earnings per share amounts required by IAS 33 Earnings per share see note 14.

For the 98.5 per cent of shareholders who exercised their rights, a comparison of the actual cash payments received by the shareholders is better reected by adjusting the dividend per share amounts by the ratio of shares outstanding immediately before the rights issue to the number of shares outstanding immediately following the rights issue as set out in the table below.
This approach is consistent with the adjustments to the dividend per share amounts following the rights issue in 2008.

In calculating the bid-offer valuation adjustment, reference is These valuation techniques include discounted cash ow analysis usually made to the risk contained within a similar bucket, for models, option pricing models, simulation models and other example the interest rate risk is divided in time buckets and a standard models commonly used by market participants.

The rationale for following this methodology is to take collateralised and uncollateralised trades.
Valuation techniques account of the different risks that exist for each of the time buckets incorporate assumptions that other market participants would use and the different hedge transactions that would need to be in their valuations, such as discount rates, default rates, credit executed to insulate the gross risk in those buckets, should the spreads and option volatilities.

Financial instruments continued The following sets out the Groups basis of establishing fair values Investment securities of the financial instruments shown above.
For investment securities that do not have directly observable market values, the Group utilises a number of valuation techniques Cash and balances at central banks to determine fair value.
Where available, securities are valued using The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their inputs proxied from the same or closely related underlying for carrying amounts.
example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer or inputs proxied from a different underlying for example, a similar Loans and advances to banks and customers bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating.
Certain For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of oating rate instruments cannot be proxied as set out above, and in such cases placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts.
The the positions are valued using non-market observable inputs.

The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash ow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.

The most recent actuarial assessment of the Fund for the purpose of funding was performed as at 31 December 2008 by A Zegelman, Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries, of Towers Watson Actuaries, using the projected unit method.
As part of the 31 December 2008 actuarial valuation, the Trustee reviewed the life expectancy assumptions adopted.
The assumptions having the most significant effect on the outcome of this valuation were: Return from Gilts 3.85 per cent per annum Return from return seeking assets 6.05 per cent per annum General increase in salaries 2.80 per cent per annum Rate of price ination 2.80 per cent per annum Increase in pensions: In deferment where applicable 2.80 per cent per annum 1 In payment pre April 1997 service 2.60 per cent per annum In payment post April 1997 service 2.00 2.80 per cent per annum 1 Applies to discretionary increases and some guaranteed increases.
Applying these assumptions, at the valuation date the market value of the assets of the Fund $1,228 million was sufficient to cover 89.3 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members.
Additional contributions of $66 million were paid during 2010.
No further additional contributions are payable over the three years to 31 December 2013.
Contributions paid to the Fund during 2010 were $78 million 2009: $21 million and regular contributions were set at 28 per cent of pensionable salary for all members.
With effect from 1 July 1998 the Fund was closed to new entrants and new employees have subsequently been offered membership of a dened contribution scheme.
Due to the closure of the Fund to new entrants, it is expected that the current service cost will increase, as a percentage of pensionable pay, as the members approach retirement.

2001 Performance Share Plan 2001 PSP Valuation The fair value of awards is based on the market value less an adjustment to take into account the expected dividends over the vesting period.
The same fair value is applied for awards made to both the directors and employees of the Group.
As set out in the Directors Remuneration Report, half the award is dependent on a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition and half dependent on an EPS performance condition.
The fair value of the TSR component is derived by discounting 50 per cent of the award that is subject to the TSR condition by the loss of expected dividends over the performance period together with the probability of meeting the TSR condition, which is calculated by the area under the TSR vesting schedule curve.
The EPS fair value is derived by discounting 50 per cent of the award by the loss of expected dividends over the performance period.
In respect of the EPS component only, the number of shares expected to vest is adjusted for actual performance when calculating the charge for the year.

The assumed rate of ination affects the rate models which require inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, at which salaries grow and therefore the size of the pensions that expected dividends, expected volatility and the expected option life employees receive on retirement.
