BASIS OF PREPARATION 1.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING the company-only financial statements of cookson Group plc the company, a company registered in the united Kingdom, are prepared in accordance with the companies Act 2006 and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with uK GAAp.
A separate company-only profit and loss account has not been presented, as permitted by section 408 3 of the companies Act 2006.
1.2 BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEmENTS ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the company.
SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES the following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in relation to the company-only financial statements.
2.1 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAxATION Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
2.2 SHARE-BASED PAYmENTS the company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees.
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
the fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the total shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
the cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Blackscholes model.
2.3 PENSION COSTS the company participates in a uK-wide Group pension plan the uK plan providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
the assets of the uK plan are held separately from those of the company in an independently administered fund.
the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the uK plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRs 17, Retirement Benefits, accounts for the uK plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Following a period of consultation with its employees, the closure of the uK plan to future accrual took effect from 31 July 2010, with a new Group personal pension plan established in its place to provide defined contribution benefits for all eligible uK employees.
As a result of these changes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the uK plan and the Group personal pension plan during the year.
the new Group personal pension plan established with effect from 31 July 2010 also replaced, for future accrual, the uK-wide Group defined contribution pension plan to which the company participated up to that date.
the assets of both old and new plans are held separately from those of the company in independently administered funds.
the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to each plan for the part of the year during which each was in operation.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.

SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.4 POST-RETIREmENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS the company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan.
the costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not funded and the amount recognised in the balance sheet is based upon an independent actuarial valuation, using the projected unit method.
2.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES transactions in currencies other than the companys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
2.6 FINANCE COSTS interest-bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
2.7 FINANCIAL INSTRUmENTS the company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings.
in accordance with its treasury policy, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
the method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
the fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
the fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
2.8 INVESTmENT IN SUBSIDIARIES shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost, together with long-term loans that are stated at amortised cost, less any impairment in value.
2.9 PROVISIONS provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation.
provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.

EmPLOYEE BENEFITS 17.1 PENSION PLANS the company participates in a uK-wide Group defined benefit pension plan the uK plan.
the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the uK plan and therefore accounts for its membership of the plan as it would for a defined contribution plan.

the last full actuarial valuation of the uK plan, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out as at 31 December 2009.
At that date, the market value of the plan assets was 401.9m, representing 88% of accrued plan benefits at the time using the projected unit method of valuation of 456.4m.
calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the uK plan benefits with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 589.0m, representing a funding level of 68%.
the 2009 full valuation has been updated, as appropriate, in order to estimate the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2010, at which date the market value of the plan assets was 443.2m 2009: 404.1m, representing 101% 2009: 95% of estimated accrued plan benefits of 439.7m 2009: 426.4m.
in July 2010, the uK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases both for pensions in payment and pensions in deferment to apply to private sector pension schemes.
the company, the uK plan trustee and their respective legal advisers are currently working to clarify how this impacts the uK plan and will communicate with any affected members in 2011. the new Group personal pension plan established with effect from 31 July 2010 also replaced, for future accrual, the uK-wide Group defined contribution pension plan to which the company participated up to that date.
the pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the company to each plan for the part of the year for which each was in operation and amounted to 0.1m 2009: 0.1m.
there were no outstanding contributions payable to the plan as at 31 December 2010 31 December 2009: nil.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
