BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 57 Filtrona plc For more information visit: Annual Report 2010 www.
com For awards granted in 2008, and beyond, 50% of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition and 50% of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition.
The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards will require the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation over three financial years to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum for 12.5% of the awards to vest.
The proportion of the awards vesting will increase on a straight line basis, and for 50% of the awards to vest such adjusted EPS growth must exceed inflation by an average of at least 8% per annum.
The performance condition will be tested after three financial years and there will be no provision for retesting.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant awards will lapse.
Since 2009 LTIP B awards which are granted in the last four months in any year will utilise the EPS figure as at the end of that relevant financial year as the base figure rather than the preceding years EPS.
The performance period will begin with the three year period commencing with the financial year immediately following the date of grant and awards will therefore have a vesting period of between three and three and a half years.
The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions each time performance share awards are granted under LTIP Part B in order to ensure that they remain challenging and may impose different conditions on share awards granted in subsequent years.
