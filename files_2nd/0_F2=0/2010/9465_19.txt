Also, the German, Switzerland, and the Central and Eastern Europe businesses were consolidated in a newly created Northern and Central Europe segment along with rest of the Nordics segment, which has resulted in reclassi cation of 135.1 million of goodwill from the International segment to the Northern and Central Europe segment.
A reportable segment may contain more than one Cash Generating Unit CGU.
Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to individual CGUs.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
CGUs represent the operations of a country or, where appropriate, divisions within a country.
The size of a CGU, therefore, varies but is never larger than a reportable segment.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
Although required to perform annual impairment tests, these do not have to take place at 31 December but the test should be consistently carried out at the same time annually.
The Group carries out its annual impairment testing as at 30 September each year.
Impairment testing is only reperformed if an impairment triggering event occurs in the intervening period.
No such event has occurred since 30 September 2010.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash ow projections for a CGU.
The cash ow projections in the four financial years following the budget year re ect managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash ows.
In determining the key assumptions, management have taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that re ects market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the reporting period and the risks speci c to the CGU.
In determining the discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The discount rates applied to the CGUs were in the range of 7.8% 2009: 8.0% to 22.2% 2009: 13.9%.
101 Logica Annual report and accounts 2010 16.
Goodwill continued The discount rates applied to the most signi cant CGUs were as follows: 2010 2009 % % France 11.7 11.1 Northern and Central Europe 8.4 9.2 United Kingdom 11.0 10.2 Sweden 8.2 8.0 Weighted average discount rate applied to CGUs in the Northern and Central Europe.
Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operations is based on future market expectations and past performance.
The long-term operating margin refers to the margin on adjusted operating pro t as described in Note 8.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
In such cases, these expected improvements exclude activities that would be fide ned as restructuring and are independent of technological change or evolution of best practices that the Group could not predict or in uence.
The long-term operating margins applied to CGUs were in the range of 4.0% 2009: 5.0% to 10.0% 2009: 10.0%.
The long-term operating margins assumed for the most signi cant CGUs were as follows: 2010 2009 % % France 9.0 9.0 Northern and Central Europe 8.8 8.8 United Kingdom 9.0 9.0 Sweden 9.0 9.0 Weighted average long-term operating margin applied to CGUs in the Northern and Central Europe.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken, and were in the range of 0.25% 2009: 1.9% to 8.15% 2009: 6.0%.
The long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows assumed for the most signi cant CGUs were as follows: 2010 2009 % % France 1.5 2.0 Northern and Central Europe 2.0 2.4 United Kingdom 1.6 2.4 Sweden 2.2 2.3 Weighted average long-term growth rate applied to CGUs in the Northern and Central Europe.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2009: nil.
As part of the VIU testing the Directors consider the impact that a range of scenarios could have on the key assumptions within the VIU calculation.
Long-term operating margin The Directors consider that a reduction of 1% in the absolute value of long-term operating margins across all CGUs would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is exible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of sectors and geographies and has a large number of long-term contracts which help to insulate it from more signi cant changes.
If the long-term operating margins used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 1% lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have to recognise a goodwill impairment charge, in any CGU other than Brazil CGU where an impairment of 4.6 million 2009: nil would be necessary.
If operating margins remain in perpetuity at current levels the Group would recognise an impairment in three 2009: two of its smaller CGUs being Belgium, 8.2 million 2009: nil, Brazil, 6.1 million 2009: 5.3 million, and the Czech Republic of nil 2009: 4.8 million.
The Directors do not believe it is likely operating margins will decline based on their view of current prospects and given the exibility of the cost base.
Long-term discount rate The Group bases its estimate for the long-term pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The Directors consider that a 1% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that should be considered as reasonably possible as this represents an 8% to 20% reduction in the WACC.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash ows of all CGUs were 1% higher in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognised a goodwill impairment charge, except for Brazil CGU of 4.3 million 2009: nil.
The discount rate assumed in Brazil CGU was 22.2% 2009: 11.0%.
102 Financial statements Consolidated financial statements 16.
Goodwill continued Long-term growth rate The Group uses a long-term growth rate that is the same as the long-term growth rate of gross domestic product GDP of the country in which the CGU is based, using Economist Intelligence Unit EIU data.
Given these are long-term rates, the Directors consider a change of 1% in the absolute value of the long-term growth rate to be the limit of what is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth rates used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 1% lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognised a goodwill impairment charge, except for Brazil CGU where an impairment of 2.7 million 2009: nil would be necessary.
The VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating margin.
The Directors are of the opinion that it would take a systemic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where an impairment would be required.
In a hypothetical extreme case, with a reduction of 1% in operating margin, discount rates and growth rates, no impairment would occur in any CGU except for Brazil CGU where a change in all three assumptions at the same time would incur an impairment of approximately 3-6 million to the carrying value of goodwill of 17.2 million 2009: 17.8 million.
The Directors consider this conjugation of scenario unlikely particularly given the strong growth prospects in Brazil.
As a consequence no impairment has been recognised.
Brand names, customer contracts relationships and software products represented assets recognised as part of a business combination.

The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in net operating costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
Unwind of discount is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income Note 11.

Included in cash at bank and in hand were overdrafts that were part of cash pooling arrangements for which a legal right of oset existed against positive cash balances that were of an equal or greater amount at the end of the reporting period.
The Directors estimate that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximated their fair value.
The Groups policy for cash investments requires that cash and deposits only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum A1 P1 short-term rating and Aequivalent long-term credit rating.
The reference to ratings must include at least one from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Cash and deposits are limited to 25.0 million per bank where the bank has a minimum AArating and 10.0 million per bank where the bank is rated A or A-.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by any of these counterparties.

All borrowings The syndicated bank loans, bilateral revolving credit facilities, overdrafts and other borrowings bear oating rates of interest based on LIBOR or equivalents appropriate to the currency in which the borrowing is incurred, and thus expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The private placements and finance lease obligations bear xed rates of interest and therefore expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All borrowings are denominated in the borrowing entitys functional currency except for certain amounts drawn down under the revolving credit facility, term loans, and the 56.2 million private placement.
Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing company are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations see Note 26 and therefore only expose the Group to statement of comprehensive income foreign currency risk to the extent that the hedge is ine ective.
The Directors have estimated the fair value of the Groups borrowings as follows: 2010 2009 m m Bank overdrafts 25.8 29.2 Bank loans 216.3 392.2 Private placement debt notes 88.7 Finance lease obligations 4.1 6.0 Other borrowings 1.6 2.3 336.5 429.7 Fair value has been estimated by discounting the cash ows relating to borrowings at the market rate at the end of the reporting period or, for the quoted instruments, by reference to the prevailing market price and exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.

The principal risks that the Group is exposed to are capital risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies with respect to managing those risks in both the current and prior year are set out below.
The Group does not undertake any speculative trading in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury function Group Treasury provides a centralised service to the Group for funding and foreign exchange management.
Group Treasury operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the Board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the Groups risks.
The policies provide written principles on net debt management, currency mix of debt, central funding liquidity, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, bonds and guarantees, and cash investment and counterparty limits.
Compliance with key policies and exposure limits is reviewed by internal audit on a regular basis.
Capital risk management The Groups policy on capital structure is to keep the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation below a target level reviewed by the Board.
The Board sets the dividend policy and reviews uses of cash and currency mix of debt to ensure that the capital structure leverage ratio remains within the target and thereby comfortably below the financial covenants contained within the Groups debt facilities.
The Group was in compliance with all debt covenants at each reporting period end.
109 Logica Annual report and accounts 2010 26.
Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations in many countries worldwide, exposing the Group to foreign exchange risk on the translation of the statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position of foreign operations into pounds sterling.
Operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk from committed transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and, once recognised, the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The translation of the statement of financial positions of overseas operations has been partially hedged by managing the currency mix of the Groups borrowings.
The Group used euro and Swedish krona borrowings to hedge the statement of financial position translation of operations with the euro and Swedish krona as their functional currency.
The Group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk relating to the translation of the statement of comprehensive incomes of overseas operations.
To mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than an entitys functional currency, assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currencies are hedged economically by means of forward contracts.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting to these contracts.
The Groups Treasury Risk Management Policy requires all companies in the Group to hedge their material assets and liability exposures in full by using forward contracts.
Additionally, where material, the Group hedges its contracted future project cash ows in foreign currencies by using forward contracts.
Group Treasury is the only function in the Group allowed to transact external foreign exchange contracts with banks.
To ensure compliance with the above policy, subsidiaries use Group Treasury as an internal bank, hedging their material foreign exchange exposures on an inter-company basis.
These exposures are then aggregated and netted in Group Treasury and the overall position hedged externally.
The foreign exchange exposures for the most signi cant foreign currencies reported to Group Treasury and the related hedging of those exposures against pounds sterling at 31 December were as follows: 2010 m US$m SEKm Reported exposure 182.5 43.0 2,128.6 Forward contracts 182.5 43.0 2,128.6 2009 m US$m SEKm Reported exposure 229.4 34.6 2,506.5 Forward contracts 229.4 34.6 2,506.5 Positive amounts represented an asset or a forward purchase, whereas negative amounts represented a liability or forward sale.
At 31 December 2010, if the euro, US dollar and Swedish krona had strengthened by 10% against pounds sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax pro t and equity for the year would have been lower as follows: 2010 2009 Pro t and loss Equity Pro t and loss Equity Project forward contracts m m m m Euro 1.1 9.1 2.3 25.6 US dollar 0.2 0.2 Swedish krona 12.3 19.9 If these currencies had weakened by 10%, the opposite would be true.
The movement in post-tax pro t is as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US Dollar, euro and Swedish krona denominated derivatives used to hedge contracted project future cash ows.
The movement on equity is mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses gains on translation of borrowings and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The above impact on equity of movements in exchange rates does not include the change in value of underlying investments denominated in foreign currency which are being hedged.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and debt.
Careful consideration is given to the appropriate split of debt and equity to ensure acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is then further managed by hedging a portion of the Groups oating rate borrowings at xed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had 222.0 million 2009: 96.9 million of xed rate borrowings out of total borrowings of 336.6 million 2009: 429.9 million.
If interest rates on oating rate euro, Swedish krona and pounds sterling denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher during the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009, with all other variables held constant, post-tax pro t would have been lower as a result of higher interest expense on those borrowings, as follows: 2010 2009 Borrowings m m Euro 2.0 2.3 Swedish krona Pounds sterling 0.1 0.2 Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain su cient headroom to meet its foreseeable nancing requirements.
Substantial committed facilities are maintained with a syndicate of leading international banks and private placement debt holders.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had available committed debt facilities of 713.1 million 2009: 789.6 million of which 306.6 million 2009: 395.3 million had been drawn down, giving a headroom of 406.5 million 2009: 394.3 million.
The highest amount drawn down on these facilities during 2010 was 554.8 million 2009: 477.7 million.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows and include both interest and principal cash ows.
The adjustment column represents the possible future cash ows attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which are not included in the carrying amount of the financial liability in the statement of financial position.
Except for bank loans, private placement debt notes and finance lease obligations, balances due within year equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not signi cant.

Financial instruments continued Financial instruments fair value measurement E ective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
It requires disclosure of fair value measurement by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : input other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as price or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and inputs from the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
As at the end of the reporting period, the Group had only level 2 financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
The following table shows the value and type of derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2010.
These are recognised as separate assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables at 31 December: 2010 2009 m m Assets: Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading 8.7 0.5 Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging 6.9 Total assets 8.7 7.4 Liabilities: Financial liabilities at fair value through pro t or loss Forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading 4.3 7.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts used for hedging 3.7 Interest rate swaps designated as cash ow hedges 0.2 0.2 Total liabilities 8.2 7.4 Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments are as follows: the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined from dealer quotes of the instruments: and the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.
The principal currencies of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2010 were the euro, Swedish krona and the US dollar.
The notional amounts outstanding at that date were 193.4 million buying 2009: 229.3 million net buying, SEK 2,156.3 million selling 2009: SEK 2,532.8 million net selling and $45.7 million selling 2009: $32.9 million selling.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations On 1 January 2010, the Group had euro and Swedish krona borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in eurozone countries and Sweden.
At 31 December 2010 the designated borrowings comprised SEK 1,300 million forward contracts, 50 million bilateral term loan debt and 56.2 million of private placement debt.
The fair value of the designated euro borrowings at 31 December 2010 was a liability of 90.8 million 2009: 95.3 million and that of the Swedish krona forward contracts was a liability of 3.7 million 2009: asset of 5.0 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 4.0 million relating to these borrowings in the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: 40.8 million gain has been recognised directly in the translation reserve.
There was no hedging ine ectiveness recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: nil.
The foreign exchange loss was o set by the decline in value in pounds sterling terms, of the Groups net assets in eurozone countries and Sweden.

The property costs provided for are mainly related to properties located in the United Kingdom.
At 31 December 2010, non-current vacant property provisions amounted to 23.4 million 2009: 30.8 million of which 17.4 million 2009: 22.9 million was payable within five years and the balance thereafter.
Restructuring At 31 December 2010, the restructuring provision mainly related to the restructuring of the businesses following the outcome of the Groups business review announced on 22 April 2008.
The restructuring programme comprised property rationalisation, a reduction in headcount and other measures to reduce the cost base.
Where appropriate, provisions arising from the property rationalisation are categorised as vacant property.
At 31 December 2010, 15.5 million of the restructuring provision was payable within one year, with the remaining balance payable between two and five years.
Other At 31 December 2010, the other provisions related to the value of legal claims and business disposal provisions.
At 31 December 2010, 5.4 million of the other provision was payable within one year, with the remaining balance payable between two and five years.

Deferred tax continued The Group has estimated that 13.3 million of the deferred tax assets of 70.3 million at 31 December 2010 will be recoverable within 12 months.
Deferred tax asset of 0.6 million 2009: 15.8 million relating to retirement bene t schemes was recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had unused tax losses of 228.3 million 2009: 244.3 million available for o set against future taxable pro ts for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised.
At 31 December 2010, 57.8 million 2009: 77.1 million of the unused losses are subject to time expiry rules and will expire in full on or before 31 December 2019 2009: 31 December 2019.
No deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary di erences and it is probable that such di erences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group has estimated that tax of 11.6 million 2009: 7.9 million would arise in respect of remitting all earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the United Kingdom to the extent legally possible.
The reduction in the statutory corporation tax rate in the UK from 28% to 27% with e ect from 1 April 2011 has been substantially enacted during the year ended 31 December 2010.
The e ects on the results for the year ended 31 December 2010 is an additional tax charge of 1.0 million.

Other reserves continued Translation reserve The translation reserve represented the accumulated exchange di erences arising from the following sources: the impact of the translation of the statement of comprehensive income and net assets of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than pounds sterling: exchange di erences recycled on disposal of foreign operations: exchange di erences arising on the translation of net investments in a foreign operation where any subsidiary of the Group may have a receivable from or a payable to a foreign operation and settlement is neither planned nor likely: and exchange di erences arising on hedging instruments that are designated hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, net of tax where applicable.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve is a non-distributable reserve and contained the nominal value of the shares re-purchased and cancelled.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represented the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued by the Company to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement, which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree must apply Section 131 of the Act.
When applicable, the section required that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, the Company did not record a premium on the share it issued but recognised a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Assets classified as held-for-sale and disposed of At 31 December 2009 the Board of Directors had decided to sell the Groups payroll processing division in the Netherlands.
The sale of the business completed on 16 July 2010 for 3.2 million leading to a loss on disposal of 1.7 million.
No other businesses have been disposed of during the year.
The disposal does not match the criteria of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations as the disposal does not represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and hence has not been treated as a discontinued operation.
Acquisitions During the year the Group has completed two minor acquisitions of businesses in Sweden and Denmark.
These acquisitions were in connection with outsourcing contract wins.
The acquisitions have involved taking over people and in some cases also certain xed assets.
The Group has invested 9.1 million including 0.2 million deferred consideration to acquire these businesses and recognised goodwill of 6.8 million.
Share-based payment Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements The Group operates the following equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Restricted Stock Award RSA, the Restricted Share Plan RSP, the Logica Partners Incentive Plan PIP, the Logica Partners Performance Multiplier Plan PPMP, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Sharesave Plans International and UK approved SAYE, the Deferred Investment Share Plan DISP, the Employee Share Matching Plan ESMP and the Share Option Plan SOP and two further plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Executive Equity Partnership Plan ExEPP.
Under the latter two plans, no further grants will be made as their 10 year award cycle has come to an end, but under which executives still have current awards.
A summary of the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment expense has been recognised.
Restricted Stock Award On commencement of employment, in compensation for forfeited incentives, Andy Green received a restricted share award of 2,110,967 ordinary shares to vest over a period of four consecutive years from commencement of employment.
The number of shares that vest at each tranche will be increased by reference to dividends paid on shares between the grant date and the vesting date.
The shares are released in tranches at the end of March in each of the four years and vest immediately provided he is still employed by the Group on the vesting date.
The first tranche was granted in February 2008 and vested in March 2008.
Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan is used to reward executives below Board level, for new hires and for retention purposes.
Prior to 2010 Logica made one-o awards for recruitment and or retention on a bespoke basis without having an underlying framework set of rules to support them.
The RSP is used in connection with the recruitment of senior employees where it is sometimes necessary to compensate for the value of share-based awards forfeited on cessation of employment with previous employers and or to o er a joining grant or to support the retention of critical employees with awards being satis ed by market purchase shares.
Partners Incentive Plan The PIP is a discretionary bene t o ered by the Group for the bene t of its senior employees.
This plan has largely replaced the LTIP.
The value of the award is based on an annual pool determined by reference to pro t performance.
Selected employees Partners are awarded point allocations in connection with a pool year, these points are then converted into conditional awards of deferred free shares following the determination of the annual pool.
The annual pool is determined by the level of pro t before tax achieved.
The conditional awards vest three years from grant subject to continued employment but are not subject to performance conditions.
The PIP rewards service in the year prior to grant as the pool year on which the awards are based precedes the year of grant.
A share-based payment charge is recognised from the start of the pool year rather than from date of grant.
Partners Performance Multiplier Plan The PPMP is also a discretionary bene t o ered by the Group to its most senior employees.
The PPMP has the potential to reward the most senior employees with an additional award of up to twice the number of deferred shares awarded under the PIP.
PPMP awards will ordinarily vest at the same time as the deferred share awards granted under the PIP i. e. three years from grant 4.25 years from commencement of service condition and the pool year subject to continued employment and to the extent that the performance conditions attached to the awards have been achieved.
The PPMP is conditional on a measure of EPS performance for grants prior to 2010, but subsequent grants are conditional on Adjusted Pro t Before Tax APBT per share performance.
The PPMP rewards service in the year prior to grant as the pool year on which the awards are based precedes the year of grant.

Share-based payment continued Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a discretionary bene t o ered by the Group for the bene t of its senior employees, as well as to sta with high potential or to recognise signi cant achievements.
An award under the LTIP may be granted as a conditional allocation, a nil or nominal cost option with a short exercise window or as forfeitable shares.
Cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards may also be granted or cash-based payments may be used to satisfy an award originally made in shares either in whole or part, although the Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to do so.
The maximum market value of ordinary shares in the Company subject to LTIP awards granted to any employee in any financial year will not exceed 200% of that employees base salary.
The intention initially is not to exceed 150% of salary.
For awards prior to 2009, the performance condition attached to one half of an award requires annual earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum over three financial years for between 30% and 100% of this half of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other half of an award measures the Total Shareholder Return performance TSR of Logica over a single three-year performance period against a number of other companies.
30% of this half of the award will vest if the Company is ranked in the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of this half of the award vesting if Logica is at or above the upper quartile.
For grants made in 2009 there is no requirement to exceed RPI.
For grants made from 2010 the EPS measure has been replaced by a measure based on APBT growth per share.
From 2010 onwards the TSR comparator group is the entire FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
The Remuneration Committee intends to review the performance conditions each year to ensure that they remain suitable and re ect the ongoing market.
Sharesave Plans The Group operates UK and International savings-related share option plans under which employees enter into a savings contract with a financial institution to pay a xed monthly sum for a three year period.
The price at which share options are granted is the mid-market price of a Logica share on the business day prior to the invitation to apply to join the plan to which a discount of 20% has been applied.
The aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract.
Share options may be exercised six months following the vesting date.
There are no performance conditions attached to Sharesave Plans.
Employee Share Match Plan Deferred Investment Share Plan The Group operates an equity participation plan for Executive Directors and EC Members, the Deferred Investment Share Plan DISP, this was formerly known as the Executive Equity Participation Plan ExEPP 2006.
In certain countries the Group also operates an equity partnership plan open to all employees the ESMP, this was formerly known as the Employee Equity Partnership Plan EmEPP.
The terms of both plans are similar.
Under the equity share match plans, employees make an investment in the Companys shares, subject to financial limits, which must be maintained over a three-year vesting period.
Shares will vest under the DISP and the ESMP for all grants prior to 2008 if a performance condition is met and the participant is still employed at the vesting date.
Under the DISP, Executive Directors and EC Members, in any one year, are required to invest 20% of their net bonus, and may invest in shares up to a maximum of a further 30% of net bonus paid.
These lodged shares will be matched on a 1:1 gross basis the Matching Award.
Matching Award shares will be released as soon as practicable after the third anniversary of the award, subject to the stretching performance conditions having been met.
The performance conditions in respect of the DISP have the same criteria as the Companys LTIP performance conditions described above.
Awards made since 2008 under the ESMP do not carry a performance condition.
Awards of a matching number of shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will lapse.
Although no further awards will be made under the ExEPP there remain outstanding awards which have yet to be exercised.
This plan was operated for senior executives as an equity-based investment plan subject to financial limits and the investment being maintained over a three-year vesting period.
Vesting will occur for those executives employed at the vesting date subject to a performance condition based on growth in the Groups earnings per share exceeding the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum.
The exercise period for the ExEPP runs for seven years from the maturity date.
Share Option Plan At the Companys AGM in 2006 shareholders approved the implementation of the Share Option Plan, formerly known as the Executive Share Option Plan 2006 ESOP 2006.
This plan was introduced to allow awards to be made to senior executives working in jurisdictions where it would be inappropriate to make an award under the LTIP.
It is anticipated that performance conditions attached to any SOP awards will have the same criteria as the LTIP noted above.
As yet, no awards have been made under this plan.
Executive Share Option Scheme No new option grants will be made under the ESOS, although options made under previous grants to senior executives and managers across the Group remain outstanding.
Options are normally exercisable between three and 10 years following grant, provided that a performance condition, speci ed at the date of grant, has been satis ed.
Typically, growth in the Groups earnings per share over the relevant three-year performance period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21% for the performance condition to be met.
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven-year exercise period, while the exercise period for option grants in 2005 and 2006 is four years.
All ESOS awards have vested.
The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant, although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.

Share-based payment continued US Stock Purchase Plan US-based employees are eligible to participate in a tax-favourable share purchase plan.
They may save up to a maximum of $2,000 per annum, the savings being used to buy shares at quarterly intervals.
Logica North America contributes an additional 15% to the amount saved per employee.
US-based employees are not eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plans or the ESMP.
Insight formerly Unilog plan Managers in France who are eligible to participate in the Insight fund may annually choose to invest all or part of their bonus into this fund.
Logica France contributes 50% of the bonus invested by the employee to a maximum of 4,000 per annum.
The Insight fund currently invests 100% of its capital in Logica shares and is managed by an external fund manager appointed by Logica France.
French Savings Plan A Plan dEpargne dEnterprise P. E. E. is operated for those employees in France not covered by the Insight plan above.
There is a maximum individual investment amount per year, to which Logica adds an amount equivalent to the amount of employer social charges saved.
The funds are invested for a period of five years and are exempt from tax.
The funds are managed by CIC Bank and are invested in shares.
These awards have service conditions relating to 2009 and 2010 but the grants do not take place until the year following the commencement of the service condition.
As a result there is a share-based payment charge during the year of service and prior to grant.
In the above analysis these provisional awards are re ected in the year of service and are reversed in the year they are replaced by the actual grant.

The fair values of share awards under the DISP, ESMP, PPMP and PIP were measured at the market share price at the date of grant reduced for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period, for which award holders have no entitlement.
The fair values of the provisional share awards under the PIP and PPMP were measured as the market share price at 31 December 2009 and 2010 applying the same ratio of fair value to market price as used for the grants during 2009 and 2010.
Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the share option.
The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
Share awards under the DISP, ESMP, PPMP and PIP are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date.
Sharesave options are assumed to be exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full.
Adjustments are made subsequently to the number of shares expected to vest, to re ect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the final determination on the vesting date.
The share-based payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the end of the reporting period to the end of the vesting period following cessation of employment.
A weighted average forfeiture rate of 9% per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: 9%.
For exercises prior to the vesting date, the additional expense between the calculation date and the vesting date is immediately charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group and the Company recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of 9.4 million and 1.3 million 2009: 7.8 million and 1.4 million respectively.
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements As part of the PIP and RSP plans employees receive a cash amount on vesting equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period.
These dividend equivalents are treated as cash-settled share-based payment arrangements for accounting purposes.
Social security obligations arising on share option and share award plans are also treated as cash-settled share-based payment arrangement for accounting purposes.
For the Group, the liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments and dividend equivalents at 31 December 2010 was 5.8 million 2009: 3.1 million.
The movement in the liability resulted in an expense for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 2.7 million 2009: 1.7 million.
For the Company, the liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments and dividend equivalents at 31 December 2010 was 0.8 million 2009: 0.7 million.
The movement in the liability resulted in a charge for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 0.3 million 2009: 0.4 million.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of voluntary pension schemes of the fide ned contribution type in the UK and overseas, under which contributions are paid by Group undertakings.
In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge for fide ned contribution schemes amounted to 133.7 million 2009: 126.1 million.
In Sweden, the Group contributed to the Alecta SE pension scheme which is a fide ned bene t pension scheme.
This pension scheme was classi ed as a fide ned contribution scheme as it is a multi-employer plan and su cient information is not available to bifurcate the assets of the plan between the various employers.
Any surplus or fide cit in the plan will a ect the amount of future contributions payable.
Alecta used a collective funding ratio to determine the surplus or fide cit in the pension scheme.
The collective funding is the di erence between Alectas assets and the commitments to the policyholders and insured individuals.
The collective solvency is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 155%, with the target being 140%.
At 30 September 2010, Alectas collective funding ratio was 137% 2009: 141%.
Contributions of SEK 201.0 million were made during the year 2009: SEK 198.3 million.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates fide ned bene t pension schemes primarily for the bene t of employees in the UK and the Netherlands, with smaller schemes in other European countries and the US.
The larger schemes are funded schemes but there are unfunded schemes in France and Sweden.
fide ned bene t schemes are usually funded by contributions from the employing companies, and in some cases also employees, to meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews.
The schemes assets are held in funds separate from those of the Group.
Scheme bene ts typically provide for a pension in retirement based on years of qualifying service and final pensionable salary.
The main schemes in the UK and the Netherlands are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the quali ed actuary certi es the rate of employer contributions which, together with the speci ed contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be su cient to fund the bene ts payable under the schemes.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations, for funding purposes, for the main schemes are set out below: CMG Netherlands scheme last full actuarial valuation at 31 December 2010 The scheme has been closed to new entrants since 1 July 1994.
A full member by member actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2010.
The scheme had a surplus of 43.5 million as at 31 December 2010.
Logica fide ned Bene t Pension Plan last full actuarial valuation at 30 June 2008 Based on the assumptions adopted in the Statement of Funding Principles the Plan had a fide cit of 1.25 million.
The Group made a one-o fide cit repair contribution of 1.6 million in September 2009.
LogicaCMG UK Pension and Life Assurance scheme last full actuarial valuation at 31 December 2006 At the time of the valuation the scheme had a small fide cit which was cleared by a one-o contribution of 0.1 million.
CMG UK Pension scheme last full actuarial valuation at 31 December 2007 The scheme has been closed to new entrants since 2001.
Based on the assumptions adopted in the Statement of Funding Principles the scheme had a fide cit of 23.0 million.
The Group has agreed a plan with the Trustees to clear the fide cit by 30 June 2012.
Under the recovery plan, starting from 1 January 2009, Logica will pay an additional contribution of 5% of pensionable salaries and make a series of 13 additional quarterly payments averaging 1.75 million.
The scheme was closed to accrual on 30 April 2010.
The closure of the scheme has led to a curtailment loss of 0.1 million.
To meet the requirements of IAS 19, valuations for plan assets, reimbursement rights and fide ned bene t obligations were carried out at 31 December 2010 by quali ed actuaries.
The present value of the fide ned bene t obligation, and the related current and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The expected rate of return on equities is determined by reference to real historical equity market returns.
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is calculated as a weighted average of the expected rates of return of individual asset classes.
The weighted average is calculated by reference to the amount in each class of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.
Plan assets in overseas schemes include ordinary shares of the Company with a fair value of nil at 31 December 2010 2009: 1.4 million but do not include any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.

Contingent liabilities The size, structure and geographic spread of the Group and its activities naturally exposes it to potential scrutiny and possible legal claims including tax and other regulatory authorities in the normal course of operations.
The results of tax audits and other similar enquiries are normally re ected in the accounts on an accruals basis where a recovery or liability can be predicted with reasonable certainty.
Occasionally claims may be levied against the Group by such authorities, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.
While Logica strongly believes it complies with all relevant laws and regulations, and would vigorously defend itself against any such claims, if it was unsuccessful the enforcement of such claims could from time to time have a potentially material impact on the Groups results and financial position.
In 2009, the Group received a 46 million, which is net of 13 million tax, VAT claim from the French tax authorities.
The claim relates to the VAT treatment of goods exported from France during the years 2004 to 2006.
The Group has carefully analysed these claims and obtained external experts advice, as a result of which it considers that they are without merit.
The Group is robustly contesting these claims through the appropriate channels albeit this is expected to be a protracted process.

Accounting policies The following are the principal accounting policies of the Company which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.
The Company has taken advantage of an exemption available in FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements and has not prepared a cash ow statement.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost.
Such investments include both investments in shares issued by the subsidiary and other parent entity interests that in substance form part of the parent entitys investment in the subsidiary.
These include investments in the form of loans which have no xed repayment terms and which have been provided to subsidiaries as an additional source of long-term capital.
Trade amounts receivable from subsidiaries in the normal course of business and other amounts advanced on commercial terms and conditions are included in debtors.
Investments in subsidiaries in the Companys balance sheet are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Financial instruments The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions available in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 25 para 3 c b and FRS 29 para 2 d not to disclose any information relating to financial instruments as the Companys financial statements are included in publicly available consolidated financial statements.
The following policies for financial instruments have been applied in the preparation of the Companys financial statements: Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand include deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand if there is legal right to o set against positive cash balances.
Deposits are repayable on demand if they can be withdrawn at any time without notice and without penalty or if a maturity or period of notice of not more than 24 hours or one working day has been agreed.
Cash includes cash in hand and deposits denominated in foreign currencies.
Debtors Debtors are stated at amounts receivable less any provision for recoverability.
A trade or other receivable is derecognised from the balance sheet when the Company enters into a nancing transaction which transfers to a third party all signi cant rights or other access to bene ts relating to that asset, and all signi cant exposures to the risks inherent in that asset.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated either at amortised cost or, if designated as such, at fair value through pro t or loss.
For borrowings stated at amortised cost, any di erence between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the pro t and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the e ective interest rate method.
Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable pro ts at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing di erences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing di erences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing di erences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is pounds sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the Company at the rates prevailing at the dates of the individual transactions.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising are charged or credited to the pro t and loss account within net operating costs.
Employee benefits Retirement benets The Company participates in retirement bene t plans of a fide ned contribution nature.
The cost of fide ned contribution plans is charged to the pro t and loss account on the basis of contributions payable by the Company during the year.

Accounting policies continued Share-based payment The cost of share-based employee compensation arrangements, whereby employees receive remuneration in the form of shares or share options, is recognised as an employee bene t expense in the pro t and loss account.
The total expense to be apportioned over the vesting period of the bene t is determined by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the shares or share options awarded and the number that are expected to vest.
The assumptions underlying the number of awards expected to vest are subsequently adjusted to re ect conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.
At the vesting date of an award, the cumulative expense is adjusted to take account of the awards that actually vest.
Other employee benets A liability for other employee bene ts, such as paid holiday, is recognised for the amount the Company may be required to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date.
Employee share ownership trusts Employee share ownership plan ESOP trusts, which purchase and hold ordinary shares of the Company in connection with certain employee share plans, are included in the Company financial statements.
