The Company commenced its business as an approved investment trust on 3 August 1988, following the listing of its share capital on the London Stock Exchange.
Prior to 31 March 2000, the diluted net assets were arrived at on the assumption that all convertible stock was converted at the balance sheet date.
By 31 March 2000, all convertible stock had been converted or redeemed.
Thereafter, there was no difference between the NAV and the diluted NAV.
The earnings per share is the fully diluted earnings per share, based on the profit after tax and the weighted average fully diluted number of ordinary shares in issue during each period.
Where the fully diluted earnings per share exceeded the undiluted earnings per share the latter figure has been shown in accordance with standard accounting practice.
