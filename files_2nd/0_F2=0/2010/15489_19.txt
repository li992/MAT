General information Telecity Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and has Sterling as its presentation and functional currency.
TelecityGroup plc and its subsidiaries operate in the internet infrastructure facilities and associated services industry within Europe.
The operating companies of the Group are disclosed within note 17.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of its registered office is Masters House, 107Hammersmith Road, London W14 0QH.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 the Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management toexercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, orareaswhere assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed below.
One such significant estimate istheestimated remaining useful lives of property, plant and equipment.
In accordance with IAS 16, the Group has a policy of reviewing the residual useful livesof the data centres at least annually.
During the year, the Group performed such a review in respect of its leasehold improvements and plant and machinery, the financial effect of which was to reduce the depreciation charge for the year by 1,165,000.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Act.
As permitted by the Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified inrespect of share-based payments.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under Section 408 of the Act to not present the Company profit and loss account.
The result forthe Company for the year was nil 2009: loss 253,000.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
a New and amended standards adopted by the Group Amendment to IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement effective on or after 1 July 2009.
This amendment makes two significant changes.
It prohibits designating inflation as a hedgeable component of a fixed rate debt.
It also prohibits including time value in the one-sided hedged risk when designating options as hedges.
Accordingly, hedging strategies involving options need to be re-assessed.
This amendment has no impact on the Group or Company financial statements.
b New and amended standards and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 butnot currently relevant to the Group The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning onorafter 1 January 2010 or later periods, but not currently relevant to the Group.
IFRIC 17, Distribution of non-cash assets to owners effective on or after 1 July 2009.
The interpretation was published in November 2008.
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.
IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution intheir present condition and the distribution is highly probable.
The interpretation does not have a material impact on the Group or Company financial statements.
IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers, effective for transfer of assets received on or after 1 July 2009.
This interpretation clarifies the requirements of IFRS for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services such as a supply of electricity, gas or water.
Insome cases, the entity receives cash from a customer that must be used only to acquire or construct the item of property, plant, and equipment in order to connect the customer to a network or provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services or to do both.
IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives and IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, effective 1 July 2009.
This amendment to IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract when the entity reclassifies a hybrid financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.
This assessment is to be made based on circumstances that existed on the later of thedate the entity first became a party to the contract and the date of any contract amendments that significantly change the cash flows of the contract.
Ifthe entity is unable to make this assessment, the hybrid instrument must remain classified as at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety.
Theinterpretation does not have a material impact on the Group or Company financial statements.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.1 Basis of preparation continued b New and amended standards and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 butnot currently relevant to the Group continued IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, effective 1 July 2009.
This amendment states that, in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, qualifying hedging instruments may be held by any entity or entities within the group, including the foreign operation itself, as long as the designation, documentation and effectiveness requirements of IAS 39 that relate to a net investment hedge are satisfied.
In particular, the group should clearly document itshedging strategy because of the possibility of different designations at different levels of the group.
IAS 38 amendment, Intangible assets, effective 1January 2010.
The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar useful economic lives.
Theamendment does not have a material impact on the Group or Company financial statements.
IAS 1 amendment, Presentation of financial statements.
The amendment clarifies that the potential settlement of a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non-current.
By amending the definition of current liability, the amendment permits a liability to be classified as non-current provided that the entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer of cash or other assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period notwithstanding the fact that the entity could be required by the counterparty to settle in shares at any time.
The amendment does not have a material impact on the Group or Company financial statements.
IAS 36 amendment, Impairment of assets, effective 1 January 2010.
The amendment clarifies that the largest cash-generating unit or group of units towhich goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment testing is an operating segment, as defined by paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, Operating segments that is, before the aggregation of segments with similar economic characteristics.
IFRS 2 amendments, Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions, effective from 1 January 2010.
In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS2 and IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions, the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation.
IFRS 5 amendment, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
The amendment clarifies that IFRS 5 specifies the disclosures required in respect of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale or discontinued operations.
It also clarifies that the general requirements of IAS 1 still apply, in particular paragraph 15 to achieve a fair presentation and paragraph 125 sources of estimation uncertainty of IAS 1.
c New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 andnotearly adopted The Groups and Companys assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below: IFRS 9, Financial instruments, issued in November 2009.
This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Groups accounting for its financial assets.
The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption.
However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by theEU.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact.
IAS 24 revised, Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009.
It supersedes IAS 24, Related party disclosures, issued in 2003.
IAS 24 revised ismandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted.
However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party and removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities.
The Group will apply the revised standard from 1January 2011.
When the revised standard is applied, the Group and the Company will need to disclose any transactions between its subsidiaries and its associates.
The Group is currently putting systems in place to capture the necessary information.
It is, therefore, not possible at this stage to disclose the impact, if any, of the revised standard on the related party disclosures.
Classification of rights issues amendment to IAS 32, issued in October 2009.
The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1February 2010.
The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency otherthan the functional currency of the issuer.
Provided certain conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity regardless of thecurrency in which the exercise price is denominated.
Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as derivative liabilities.
The amendment applies retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8, Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors.
The Group will apply the amended standard from 1 January 2011.
Untitled-2 11 25 02 2011 10:20:43 63 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Review of the Year Governance Financial Statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.1 Basis of preparation continued c New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 andnotearly adopted continued IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments, effective 1 July 2010.
The interpretation clarifies the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability debt for equity swap.
It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reflect the fair value of the financial liability extinguished.
The Group will apply the interpretation from 1January 2011, subject to endorsement by the EU.
It is not expected to have any impact on the Group or the Companys financial statements.
Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement amendments to IFRIC 14.
The amendments correct an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions.
This was not intended when IFRIC 14 was issued and the amendments correct this.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011.
The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the earliest comparative year presented.
The Group will apply these amendments for the financial reporting period commencing on 1January 2011.
2.2 Prior year adjustment During the current year, the Group reviewed the method for deferring set-up fees with reference to its revenue recognition policy as stated in note 2.14 below.
Whilst this review has not impacted reported revenue or profits for either of the years presented, it has resulted in an increase to the balance sheet deferred income account in relation to transactions in the pre-IPO period i. e. before 2007 with an associated adjustment to the balance sheet deferred tax account and, in accordance with IAS 8, to opening reserves.
The post tax effect of the adjustment is 2,088,000 as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The effect of the adjustment is summarised below: 31 December 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 2008 000 000 000 Increase to deferred income 2,838 2,838 2,838 Increase to deferred income taxes 750 750 750 Reduction in total equity 2,088 2,088 2,088 Impact on income statement 2.3 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary isthe fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration agreement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from consideration amendments.
Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investments.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded in goodwill.
If this isless than fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.4 Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the Groups functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are disclosed in the income statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at the closing rates of exchange.
The results are translated at an average rate, recalculated for each month between that months closing rate and the equivalent for the preceding month, based on daily average for that month.
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the closing rate, including long-term inter-company loans, are taken directly to reserves.
In addition, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries results from average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to the Groups cumulative translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the financial year in which the operations are disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
2.5 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
2.6 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary atthe date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is recorded as an intangible asset.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of anentity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups ofcash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each operating segment.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The main assumptions used when performing the impairment test are set out in note 15.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value-in-use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
2.7 Intangible assets Intangible assets, other than goodwill, represent customer contracts acquired during business combinations.
The customer contracts are initially recognised at fair value, in the currency in which the related cash flows are expected to be denominated, and amortised over estimated useful economic lives of between 10and 20 years.
The fair value is calculated by estimating the future cash flows expected to arise from the intangible asset and applying a suitable discount rate.
2.8 Property, plant and equipment The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises their purchase cost, together with the costs of installation and directly attributable external and internal costs, such as staff and property rentals, incurred during the construction or commissioning phase.
Additions to property, plant and equipment alsoinclude capitalised finance costs as explained in note 2.18.
Depreciation is calculated from the date an asset becomes available for use, so as to write-off the cost of the asset over its expected useful economic life.
The principal periods used for this purpose are: Leasehold improvements 7 20 years straight-line Plant and machinery 5 20 years straight-line Office equipment 3 5 years straight-line Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Once such assets are brought into use, such assets are transferred into the appropriate asset class and depreciated over their expected useful economic life.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.8 Property, plant and equipment continued The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if appropriate, adjusted on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset may be impaired.
If any such indicator exists, the Group tests for impairment by estimating therecoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment loss is required.
2.9 Financial assets Financial assets are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and it is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables comprise mainly trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, lessprovision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be ableto collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of threemonths or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Bank overdrafts that arerepayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
A specific provision will also be raised for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments more than 90 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Increases to the provision are charged to the income statement.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value ofestimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the provision account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the provision account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the provision account are recognised in the income statement.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.9 Financial assets continued Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards ofownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts itmay have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
2.10 Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust EBT over which the Group has direct or indirect control are deducted from the reserves of the Group.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable onsettlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance and operating leases Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are classified as a finance lease and treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments isshown within obligations under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The capital element is applied toreduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Leases that are not classified as finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received by the Group as an incentive to sign the lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or to the first break clause, if sooner.
Effective interest rate method The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
2.11 Derivative financial instruments Interest rate derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and subsequent to initial recognition are revalued at each reporting date.
The fair value is based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the relevant date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative liabilities in the balance sheet.
Amounts payable and receivable on interest rate derivatives are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Where the instrument meets the definition for hedge accounting, movements in fair value of the interest rate swap are taken to reserves.
In all other cases movements are charged or credited to the Income Statement.
2.12 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised asinterest expense.
Untitled-2 15 25 02 2011 10:20:44 67 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Review of the Year Governance Financial Statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.13 Reinstatement costs At the inception of the lease and annually thereafter, the Directors assess the cost of restoring leasehold premises to their original condition at the end ofthelease and the likelihood of such costs actually being incurred.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be probable, the discounted cost oftheliability is included in leasehold improvements and is depreciated over the duration of the lease.
The discount arising on the provision is amortised infuture years through interest.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be possible, rather than probable, it is disclosed as a contingent liability.
When assessing the likely duration of the lease and the likelihood of this liability arising, the Directors take into account their contractual and statutory rightsto renew or extend the lease terms.
2.14 Revenue Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to customers during the year, excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Whereinvoices are raised in advance for contracted services, the revenue is spread over the period of the service and deferred income is recognised onthebalance sheet.
Colocation revenues arise from the Groups infrastructure assets and are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
Generally, revenue from services is recognised when the service is provided.
When services are required before related colocation services can be provided, revenue from service contracts is bundled with the related colocation revenues and the entire amount recognised over the course of the contracts as the services are provided.
2.15 Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the long-term incentive plans.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined, using the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo models, at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
Non-market vesting conditions, which for the Group mainly relate to the continual employment of the employee during the vesting period, are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Any market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the income statement is charged with the fair value of goods and services received.
To the extent that share options are granted to employees of the Groups subsidiaries without charge, the share option charge is capitalised as part of the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
2.16 Pensions The Group operates defined contribution Group personal pension arrangements for all employees.
Contributions are made in accordance with the scheme rules and are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
2.17 Finance income Finance income arising from bank deposits is recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis.
2.18 Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
Thecommencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditure for the asset are being incurred, and activities that are necessary toget the asset ready for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use arecomplete.
2.19 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full understanding oftheGroups financial performance.
2.20 Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because itexcludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
TheGroups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Untitled-2 16 25 02 2011 10:20:44 68 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.20 Taxation continued Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities inatransaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control thereversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are made by management based on the best available evidence, due to events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year arediscussed below: Property, plant and equipment depreciation estimated remaining useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows through use compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on the Directors best estimates of future prices, output and costs and is therefore subjective.
Intangible fixed assets amortisation estimated remaining useful lives are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of intangible fixed assets are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows through use compared withnet book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on the Directors best estimates of future income fromcustomer contracts and is therefore subjective.
Dilapidations provisions liabilities in respect of obligations to restore premises to their original condition are estimated at the commencement ofthelease and are reviewed every six months.
The actual cost of these may be different depending upon whether the Group renews the lease.
Onerous lease provisions liabilities in respect of onerous leases are reviewed and updated, where necessary, to reflect current conditions and intentions.
The actual cost of these may be different depending upon whether the Group is successful in assigning the lease.
Deferred taxation full provision is made for deferred taxation, as required under IAS 12, Income taxes, at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless different future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered, and as such are subjective.
Derivatives IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
The fair values of derivative instruments are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity at future dates.
The Group generally bases its forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of the curve.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are therefore subjective.
Share-based payments the Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the long-term incentive plans.
The fair value at the grant date is determined using either the Black Scholes or the Monte Carlo models, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
The value of the expense is dependent upon certain key assumptions including the expected future volatility rate of the Groups share price at the date of grant.

Segmental information The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board of Directors the Board.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order toassess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The Board considers the business from a geographic perspective and principally assesses the performance of the UK and Ireland, and the Rest of Europe.
When further detail is required the results of individual countries are reviewed.
The Group derives its revenue from the provision of colocation and related services in France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Due to similarities in services, customers, regulatory environment and economic characteristics across the countries in which the Group operates, the Group aggregates certain segments in order to provide more meaningful analysis.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based primarily on Key Performance Indicators KPIs which are set out below.
These KPIs have been chosen because they are considered to be the main indicators of the Groups performance.
Other information provided to the Board is measured in a manner consistent with that in the Financial Statements.
Certain assets and liabilities, for example cash deposits and bank borrowings, are managed on a central basis and as such have not been allocated to individual segments.

Income tax charge continued Deferred tax At the year end the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset of 1,650,000 2009: 6,124,000 mainly in respect of trading losses offsetting accelerated tax depreciation.
During the year, the Group has recognised previously unrecognised deferred tax losses totalling 4,906,000 2009: 7,369,000 which hasreduced the deferred tax charge in the year to 2,960,000 2009: nil.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset only when they arise in the same tax jurisdiction, the amounts are expected to reverse in similar periods and the amounts would be available for offset.

In addition to the amounts recognised above, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of approximately 16,519,000 2009: 21,425,000 which relates to several of the Groups subsidiary companies.
The aggregate amount of taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries has not been recognised because the Groupis in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Business combinations On 30 July 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Internet Facilitators Limited IFL, a network-independent data centre, for cash consideration of20,526,000.
IFL is considered a complementary strategic fit within the Group and offers the opportunity to continue the Groups growth in the north ofEngland.

Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedge interest rate swap The Group uses an interest rate swap to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
As part of the Groups refinancing in February 2010, the Group closed out the previous interest rate swap and put in place a new one.
At the year end the Group had the following contracts outstanding: At 31 December 2010: Nominal value 000 Currency Maturity date Fixed rate 72,000 Sterling 12 February 2013 2.235% At 31 December 2009: Nominal value 000 Currency Maturity date Fixed rate 53,000 Sterling 30 October 2012 5.205% The fixed interest payments are as set out in the tables above and have floating rate interest receipts at LIBOR.
The fair value of the interest rate swap is shown below.
The fair value is based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Thefair value of the interest rate swap is sensitive to the assumption of future interest rate yield curves and discount rates.

Share options continued Performance Shares granted during the current and previous year were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
Grants during the previous year under the sharesave scheme were valued using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in these calculations are as follows: March February 2010 2009 January performance performance 2009 Grant date shares shares Sharesave Share price 4.07 2.00 1.79 Exercise price nil nil 1.44 Expected volatility % 42.3 45.8 26.5 Expected life years 3.0 3.0 3.0 Risk free rate % 1.97 2.06 5.50 Expected dividend yield % nil nil nil Fair value per option 2.88 1.43 0.65 Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte Carlo models for the total shareholder return elements of the long-term incentive plan in determining the fair value at grant date.
Assumptions used in these models were as follows: March February 2010 2009 % % Average share price volatility FTSE 250 comparator group 51 46 Average correlation FTSE 250 comparator group 26 34 The expected Telecity Group plc share price volatility was determined taking into account daily share price movements over a three-year period.
Due to the lack of a sufficiently long track record, this was determined by reference to Telecity Group plc daily share price movements between listing 24 October 2007 and grant of award and by reference to the share price volatility experienced by other companies in a comparable sector in the period prior to listing.
The risk free return has been determined from market yield curves of government gilts with outstanding expected terms for each relevant grant.
The charge arising from share-based payments is disclosed in note 6.
Reserves The Group and the Company Statements of Changes in Equity are disclosed as a primary statement on pages 56 and 57.
Below is a description of the nature and purpose of the individual reserves: share capital represents the nominal value of shares issued, including those issued to the EBT: share premium includes the amounts over nominal value in respect of share issues.
In addition, costs in respect of share issues are debited to this account: retained profits include the realised and unrealised gains and losses made by the Company and the Group: own shares held by the Group represent 1,840,000 2009: 2,452,000 shares in Telecity Group plc.
All shares are held by the EBT.
These shares are listedona recognised stock exchange and their market value and nominal value at 31 December 2010 was 8,657,000 2009: 9,393,000 and 4,000 2009: 5,000 respectively.
The EBT is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees and the shares held are used to satisfy some of the Groups obligations to employees for share options and other long-term incentive plans: currency translation differences on foreign currency net investments arise from the re-translation of the net investments in overseas subsidiaries, including long-term inter-company loans that are considered part of the Groups investment in its subsidiaries: and the Companys other reserve represents the cumulative share-based payment charged to reserves.

Key performance indicators During the current year, the Group has modified the way in which it measures revenue per occupied sq.
m. In order to avoid distortions arising from significant movements in occupied space that may occur close to the year end, the Group now calculates revenue per occupied sq.
m by dividing the revenue for the year bythe average occupied space during the year.
Previously it had been calculated by dividing the revenue for the year by the year end occupied space.
A comparison of the results under both the new and previous methods is given below: Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 2010 2009 New New Previous Previous Revenue for the year 000 196,397 169,383 196,397 169,383 Relevant occupied space sq.
Capital commitments Capital expenditure in respect of property, plant and equipment that had been contracted for but not provided for in the Financial Statements at 31December 2010 amounted to 15,700,000 2009: 20,911,000.
Contingent liabilities Financial guarantees granted by the Groups banks primarily in respect of operating leases amount to 9,134,000 at 31 December 2010 2009: 9,914,000.
At 31 December 2010 the estimated discounted cost of reinstating leasehold properties at the end of leases in accordance with the lease contracts amounted to 6,238,000 2009: 5,870,000.
The leases expire over a range of 2 to 16 years.
In accordance with the Group accounting policy, no amount has been provided in the Financial Statements as it is not considered probable that such liabilities will be incurred, as the Group expects to exercise its right to renew its leases when they expire and continue to operate them as data centres.

Relationship Agreement At the time of the Companys IPO, its two largest related shareholder groups, 3i Group plc and related parties 3i and Oak Hill as detailed in the substantial shareholding table on page 37 entered into a Relationship Agreement with the Company.
As a result of the disposal during the year by 3i of all the shares it held in the Company, and by Oak Hill such that it now has an interest in less than 10% of the Companys issued share capital, this Relationship Agreement was terminated during the year.
Post balance sheet events The Directors have reviewed events occurring after the balance sheet to determine whether any require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statements.
