Segmental analysis IFRS 8 has been adopted in these financial statements for the first time and requires operating segments to be based on the Groups internal reporting to its Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, which the Group regards to be the Executive Board.
The adoption of IFRS 8 has resulted in a revision to the Groups reportable segments.
The Group has identi ed its individual brands and formats as its operating segments since key decisions are made at this level.
With the exception of the operating segments discussed below the relevant IFRS 8 aggregation criteria have been met due to them sharing common characteristics such as economic characteristics, similar product offerings, and similar types of customer, and they have therefore been reported as one segment.
This incorporates all of its managed UK pub restaurants which derive the majority of their revenues from food and beverage sales.
The Group has concluded that its Lodge business, the majority of which has been sold during the period, its German pub restaurant business and its property development business, Standard Commercial Property Developments Limited SCPD, do not meet, either individually or collectively, the quantitative thresholds to constitute reportable segments as fide ned by IFRS 8.
Rather than being shown as all other segments they have been combined within the pub restaurant segment due to their non-material nature and as a result only one segment has been disclosed below for the whole Group.
The CODM uses operating pro t before exceptional items and other adjustments, calculated in accordance with IFRS, to measure the results of the reportable segment and the results below have been disclosed on this basis.
The Group reported on 24 March 2010 that in future it intends to assess the performance of its retail operating units after incorporating a rental charge and to review the results and position of the retail operating and property businesses independently.
As this change was not re ected in the management reporting of the business during the period, the Group has not yet updated its segment disclosures to re ect this proposed change.
Further information on this is provided in the financial review on pages 16 to 18.

Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in the year is 4m 2009 3m which comprises share option schemes and share awards.
The Group had seven share schemes, all of which are equity-settled, in operation during the year.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan is a HMRC approved savings scheme, whereby the proceeds from a savings contract, of either three or five years duration, may be used to purchase shares under option.
Options are typically granted in June or July of each year, at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of invitation.
There are no performance conditions.
The scheme is open to all UK employees provided that they have at least 12 months service at the date of invitation.
The vesting period is 39 months or 63 months and options may be exercised up to six months after the vesting date.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan is a HMRC approved savings scheme open to all UK employees with at least 12 months service at the date of invitation.
The plan awards free shares to participating employees based on salary, up to a maximum award of 3,000 per employee per year.
There are no performance conditions other than remaining in employment for two years from the date of award: hence there is a vesting period of two years from the award date.
Shares are generally held in Trust for at least three years and are capable of being released to participants at any time thereafter.
Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan Under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan the annual bonuses of the Executive Directors and other eligible employees may be deferred into Mitchells & Butlers plc shares.
From the 2009 10 bonus year onwards, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, at least 50% of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors and any excess over 75% of base salary earned in the year for the other eligible employees, will normally be deferred and released in equal tranches 12 and 24 months after deferral.
Participants are also entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
No award was granted relating to the 2006 07 or 2008 09 bonus year due to the losses suffered by the Company from the hedge closures in these periods.
For the award made in relation to the 2007 08 bonus year participants received one matching share award for every bonus share: matching shares and bonus shares vest three years after the award date.
Matching shares in respect of this award will only be released in full if the Groups average adjusted earnings per share including net pension income over the three year performance period ending 24 September 2011, exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index for the same period by an amount equivalent to at least 27%.
All deferrals of bonuses into shares to date have been entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Mitchells & Butlers plc 67 Annual report and accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2010 continued 6.
Share-based payments continued Long-Term Incentive Plan An award was made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP on 30 July 2010 to Executive Directors and other employees who would otherwise have been eligible to participate in the Performance Restricted Share Plan.
Participants have been awarded a conditional right to receive Mitchells & Butlers plc shares with a value determined by their percentage of the LTIP pool: 70.75% of the total pool was allocated on 30 July 2010.
The size of the LTIP pool is calculated based upon achieving a three year growth in market capitalisation of the Company in excess of the Hurdle Amount market capitalisation at award date plus 10% growth per annum, adjusted downwards for any dividends paid over the three year performance period ending on 29 July 2013.
The LTIP pool is capped at 100m with any excess over this amount requiring Remuneration Committee approval.
Overall vesting of awards is also dependent upon the achievement of an adjusted earnings per share EPS underpin whereby the award is capable of vesting only if adjusted EPS growth from financial year 2010 to 2013 is at least equal to RPI plus 12 percentage points.
If the EPS condition is not met no award vests.
If the above performance conditions are met, the value of the LTIP pool will be converted into shares using the market value of a share at the end of the performance period.
Subject to being in employment on the vesting date, participants will receive 50% of the allocation of shares once the three year performance conditions have been determined following the conclusion of the 2013 financial year end.
A further 25% of the award will then be available 12 months after the initial 50% and the remaining 25% will be available 24 months after the initial 50% vests.
Participants may also receive a payment in cash or shares of an amount equal to the dividends that are payable on shares from the end of the performance period until the vesting date.
Performance Restricted Share Plan The Performance Restricted Share Plan allows Executive Directors and other eligible employees to receive nominal cost options, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, set by the Remuneration Committee, which are normally measured over a three-year period.
Vesting for all current awards is conditional upon the achievement of a total shareholder return TSR performance condition.
It is also dependent upon either an adjusted EPS growth November 2009 award or a cash return on cash capital employed CROCCE performance condition all previous awards.
The vesting period for these options is generally three years followed by a two year exercise period.
In respect of the TSR performance condition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to incorporate the market condition in the measurement of the fair value.
For the award made in November 2009 this is based upon an index of our competitors whereas prior awards are based on a ranked approach.
For all awards, participants will be entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
Due to the introduction of the LTIP, as detailed above, no awards of the Performance Restricted Share Plan are anticipated during the three year LTIP performance period.
Executive Share Option Plan The grant of options under the Executive Share Option Plan was discontinued following shareholder approval of changes to Executive Director remuneration in 2006.
The vesting period for these options is three years from grant, followed by a seven year exercise period.
The latest possible exercise date for any of these options outstanding at 25 September 2010, is 24 May 2015.
68 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Rolled-over options Under the terms of the separation in 2003, holders of options under the Six Continents Executive Share Option Schemes were given the opportunity to exchange their Six Continents PLC options for equivalent value new options over Mitchells & Butlers plc shares.
The exchanged options are not subject to performance conditions and were immediately exercisable.
The latest possible exercise date for any of the Rolled-over options outstanding at 25 September 2010, is 28 May 2012.
Further details of the above schemes, including the changes to the Performance Restricted Share Plan and Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan, which have been implemented this year, and details relating to the new LTIP, are included in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 40 to 53.
The Group has used separate option pricing models and assumptions for each plan.
The following tables set out weighted average information about how the fair value of each option grant was calculated: Long-Term Performance Incentive Restricted Sharesave 2010 Plan Share Plan Plan Monte Carlo Simulation and Valuation model Monte Carlo Binomial Black-Scholes a Weighted average share price 311.9p 252.5p 274.0p a b Exercise price 257.0p c d c Expected dividend yield 2.00% 2.00% Risk-free interest rate 1.43% 3.28% 1.85% e Volatility 54.0% 54.1% 48.3% f Expected life years 4.09 3.00 4.15 Performance Restricted Sharesave 2009 Share Plan Plan Monte Carlo Simulation and Valuation model Binomial Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 163.3p 250.3p b Exercise price 196.0p d c Expected dividend yield 1.33% Risk-free interest rate 3.92% 3.73% e Volatility 46.9% 49.3% f Expected life years 3.00 4.20 a The share price for the LTIP multiplied by the number of shares in issue on award date gives the market capitalisation at date of award of 1,275m.
There is no exercise price associated with the LTIP.
b The exercise price relating to the Performance Restricted Share Plan is 1 per participating employee per exercise c The expected dividend yield for the Sharesave plan and LTIP has used historical dividend information.
For details on the Groups current dividend policy refer to the Chairmans Statement on page 3. d The expected dividend yield input for the grant of Performance Restricted Share Plan options in 2009 and 2010 is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of the ordinary dividends paid during the vesting period e The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards f The expected life of the options represents the average length of time between grant date and exercise date The fair value of awards under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan is equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to this scheme.
The fair value of the Share Incentive Plan shares is equal to the share price on the date of grant as there is no option price to be paid and employees are entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
Hence the assumptions set out above are not relevant to this scheme.
The Dividend Accrued Shares awarded during the period in respect of the Performance Restricted Share Plan and the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan have no incremental fair value as this has already been included within the fair value of the original award through the dividend yield assumption, as noted above.

Pensions Background Retirement and death bene ts are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with fide ned contribution and fide ned bene t sections.
The fide ned bene t sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with fide ned contribution arrangements.
The fide ned bene t liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
The Company has concluded a process of consultation and review of proposals to close the fide ned bene t plans to future accrual with the Trustees on 2 November 2010.
The ceasing of future accrual will be effective from 13 March 2011, when the Company intends to implement a revised fide ned contribution bene t structure.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities IAS 19 and IFRIC 14 The valuations used for IAS 19 purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2010 and updated by the schemes quali ed actuaries to 25 September 2010.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 25 September 2010 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
IAS 19 requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high quality corporate bonds see discount rate assumption in the table below.
The IAS 19 fide cit calculated on this basis is 143 m 2009 130 m, 2008 23 m as set out on page 74.
72 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The total pension liability of 199 m 2009 130 m, 2008 23 m is inclusive of an amount of 56 m in respect of the application of IFRIC 14 in the current period, see Amounts recognised in respect of fide ned bene t schemes below.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent quali ed actuaries.
As the fide ned bene t sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
Principal financial assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 a a b b Wages and salaries increases 2.0% 2.0% 5.0% 4.9% 4.4% Pensions increases 3.3% 3.3% 3.5% 3.4% 2.9% Discount rate 5.1% 5.5% 6.5% 5.9% 5.0% In ation rate 3.3% 3.3% 3.5% 3.4% 2.9% a Re ects the impact of pension changes introduced during the prior period b Represents the assumption for MABPP members with the equivalent assumption for MABEPP members of 6.0% in 2008 and 5.9% in 2007.
This included allowance for promotional salary increases.
The discount rate applied to the pension schemes liabilities is a signi cant driver of the net balance sheet valuation of the schemes and is subject to a high degree of judgement and complexity.
It is estimated that a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate used would, in isolation, reduce or increase the net balance sheet fide cit by approximately 30m 2009 25m, with no material impact on the income statement charge.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions have been updated following the latest full actuarial valuation and are based on the S1NA mortality tables for the MABPP and S1NA light tables for the MABEPP.
An allowance was made for medium cohort projection with a 1% underpin.
Ages are rated up by one year for pensioners of the MABPP and rated down by two years for all members of the MABEPP.
The 2009 mortality assumptions were based on the PA92 year of birth standard tables.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2010 2009 Main plan Exec plan Main plan Exec plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 20.2 24.5 19.4 23.6 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 22.9 26.3 21.2 24.8 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 23.0 25.9 22.2 26.5 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 25.7 27.9 24.0 27.7 Amounts recognised in respect of fide ned bene t schemes The long-term rates of return on assets at 25 September 2010 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension scheme assets for the 2011 financial year.
The 2009 rates shown are used in calculating the 2010 expected return.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 5.1% 2009 5.5%, 2008 6.1%.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the year was 11.8% 2009 7.9%, 2008 5.4 %, which represented a gain of 135m 2009 gain of 84m, 2008 loss of 71m.
Mitchells & Butlers plc 73 Annual report and accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2010 continued 7.
Pensions continued The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Long-term Long-term Long-term rates rates rates of return of return of return expected Value expected Value expected Value % m % m % m Equities 7.4 464 7.5 467 8.2 359 Bonds 4.1 935 4.5 800 5.3 814 Property 7.4 6 7.5 13 8.2 38 Fair value of assets 1,405 1,280 1,211 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,548 1,410 1,234 fide cit in the schemes recognised as a liability in the balance sheet 143 130 23 a Irrecoverable element of potential future pension surplus 56 Net liability 199 130 23 Associated deferred tax asset Deferred tax relating to IAS 19 valuation 39 36 6 Deferred tax on irrecoverable element of potential future a pension surplus 43 Total deferred tax asset note 20 82 36 6 a The irrecoverable element of potential future pension surplus represents the impact of IFRIC14.
During the period the Group has agreed a 10 year fide cit funding plan with the Trustees, for which the present value of the future agreed funding payments exceeds the IAS19 liability in respect of the schemes.
This would, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS and therefore a provision is recognised for any part of the surplus that would not be recoverable.
Any surplus ultimately repaid by the Trustees would currently be subject to a 35% tax charge deducted at source.
Consequently, a liability for 56 m is recognised at the balance sheet date along with the associated deferred tax asset of 43m with the net of these being a 13m decrease in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
There is no impact on the Group income statement or earnings per share.
The implementation of IFRIC 14 has had no impact on the prior periods.
The following amounts relating to the Groups fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Group income statement and Group statement of comprehensive income: 2010 2009 2008 Group income statement m m m Operating pro t: Current service cost fide ned bene t plans 8 10 13 Current service cost fide ned contribution plans 3 2 2 Exceptional pension credit 44 Charge credit to operating pro t 11 32 15 Finance income: Expected return on pension scheme assets 69 73 79 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 76 79 76 Net finance charge income in respect of pensions 7 6 3 Total charge credit 18 26 12 2010 2009 2008 Group statement of comprehensive income m m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 65 10 150 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 108 184 115 Actuarial loss recognised 43 174 35 Movement in irrecoverable element of potential future pension surplus 13 Total loss 56 174 35 74 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets in the period is as follows: Scheme assets 2010 2009 2008 Group statement of comprehensive income m m m Fair value of scheme assets at beginning of period 1,280 1,211 1,292 Expected return on plan assets 69 73 79 Employee contributions 1 1 3 Employer contributions 45 39 40 Bene ts paid 55 54 53 Actuarial gain loss recognised 65 10 150 At end of period 1,405 1,280 1,211 Changes in the present value of fide ned bene t obligations are as follows: fide ned bene t obligation 2010 2009 2008 m m m Present value of fide ned bene t obligation at beginning of period 1,410 1,234 1,310 Current service cost 8 10 13 Exceptional pension credit see note 8 44 Interest cost on bene t obligations 76 79 76 Employee contributions 1 1 3 Bene ts paid 55 54 53 Actuarial loss gain recognised 108 184 115 a At end of period 1,548 1,410 1,234 a The fide ned bene t obligation comprises 16 m 2009 15 m, 2008 18 m relating to the MABETUS unfunded plan and 1,532 m 2009 1,395 m, 2008 1,216 m relating to the MABPP and MABEPP funded plans History of experience gains and losses: 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets Amount m 65 10 150 24 43 Percentage of scheme assets 5% 1% 12 % 2% 4% Experience gains losses on scheme liabilities Amount m 34 2 16 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 2% 0% 1 % Total amount recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income Amount m 43 174 35 33 27 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 3 % 12 % 3 % 3% 2% The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 26 September 2004 in the Group statement of comprehensive income is a 199m loss 2009 156m loss, 2008 18m gain.
The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme fide cit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 26 September 2004.
Funding valuation and future funding obligations The results of the 2010 actuarial valuation showed a funding fide cit of 400m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 and on 21 July 2010 the Company formally agreed a 10 year recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding fide cit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities.
The result of this is that the Group has agreed to increase additional contributions from 24m to 40m per annum, commencing from 1 April 2010, subject to review at the next full actuarial valuation in 2013.
The Group has therefore made additional contributions of 32m during the current financial year and will make further additional contributions of 40m in each of the financial years from 2011 to 2019 and 20m in the financial year 2020.
Mitchells & Butlers plc 75 Annual report and accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2010 continued 7.
Pensions continued In the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2010, the Group paid regular contributions of 13m 2009 15m, 2008 16m and additional contributions of 32m 2009 24m, 2008 24m in respect of the fide ned bene t arrangements.
In addition the Group paid 3m 2009 2m, 2008 2m in respect of the fide ned contribution arrangements.
Future employer contribution rates to the fide ned bene t arrangements for the 2011 financial year are to be determined following conclusion of the consultation process.
Employer contribution rates to the fide ned bene t arrangements for the 2011 financial year are currently expected to be 19.9% for the MABPP and 36.6% for the MABEPP.
Based on the current future contribution rates, it is estimated that total contributions in the 52 weeks ended 24 September 2011 will be 53m, comprising regular contributions of 13m, including 3m payable in respect of the fide ned contribution arrangements and additional contributions of 40m.

Tax credit continued Reconciliation of the total tax charge The tax credit in the income statement for the year is higher 2009 higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 2009 28%.
The differences are reconciled below: 2010 2009 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Loss before tax 127 10 Accounting loss multiplied by the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 28% 2009 28% 35 3 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 6 5 Adjustments in respect of prior years 9 16 Tax credit in respect of change in tax rate 5 Total tax credit reported in the income statement 43 14 Factors which may affect future tax charges A number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
2 Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 and reduces the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
The effect of this change has been re ected in the closing deferred tax balance shown in note 20.
Further reductions are proposed to be enacted separately each year with the aim of reducing the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
In addition, proposals were put forward to reduce the rate of capital allowances from April 2012.
None of these further changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore the effects are not included in these financial statements.
We estimate that these further changes in total, if enacted as proposed, could increase the level of cash tax payable by the Group, although the full effects have yet to be quanti ed.
The reduction in the corporation tax rate is likely to result in a further reduction in the net deferred tax liability provided at 25 September 2010 of approximately 30m in total.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the pro t or loss for the financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.

Adjusted EPS amounts are presented before exceptional items see note 8 and the net pensions finance charge see note 7 in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

Properties A policy of valuing the majority of the Groups freehold and long leasehold land and buildings, for accounting purposes, was adopted on 29 September 2007.
Short leasehold properties and xtures, ttings and equipment are held at deemed cost at transition to IFRS less depreciation and impairment, which is also considered by the Group to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at their carrying value in accordance with the Groups policy or their fair value less costs to sell where this is lower.
The Group accounts for long leasehold land as an operating lease.
80 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The freehold and long leasehold land and buildings were valued at market value, as at 25 September 2010 and 26 September 2009 by Colliers International UK plc, independent chartered surveyors and by Andrew Cox MRICS, Director of Property, Chartered Surveyor.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards The Red Book assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity.
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of the location, the quality of the pub restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Changes in these assumptions such as the valuation basis applied in comparable market transactions, or the income level generated by a pub restaurant could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold land and buildings.
It is estimated that a 1 change in the EBITDA of the freehold and long leasehold land and buildings would generate a circa 8 movement in their valuation.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not revalued to fair market value are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The 23m of other impairment, included within revaluation movements above, is the result of comparing the carrying value to a value in use calculation, using a discount rate of 9% applied to the expected cash ows over the remaining life of the lease.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 3,497m 2009 3,787m, which are pledged as security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
On 15 July 2010 the Group announced the disposal of the majority of its lodge business.
On 10 August 2010 the disposal of 39 of the 52 lodges was completed, along with the sale and leaseback of six pubs, at a book value of 58m, for which a gross consideration of 72m was received and costs of 6m incurred.
Four lodges and one pub included in this transaction have been deferred and are included within assets held for sale as at 25 September 2010, along with the remaining nine lodges and one associated pub that were not included in the above transaction.
On 9 August 2010 the Group announced the disposal of Hollywood Bowl for a gross cash consideration of 27m.
On 13 August 2010 the disposal of 20 leasehold assets was completed and is included within disposals above at a net book value of 32m.
The remaining four freehold assets are included within assets held for sale as at 25 September 2010.

HMRC agreed to make a repayment of the existing claim, subject to the Group providing a guarantee to HMRC that, in the event that the existing decision is overturned in a higher court, the amount will be repayable in full.
HMRC has lodged an appeal with the European Court of Justice in respect of Rank plcs decision.
The Group is holding the repayment amount of 12m including interest and net of associated fees as a liability until there is more certainty as to the outcome of this appeal.

The analysis by year of repayment in respect of the A1N and A3N securitised loan notes is based on the assumption that the loan notes are currently not expected to be re nanced at their step-up date and are held to maturity.
Securitised debt On 13 November 2003, a group company, Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc, issued 1,900m of secured loan notes in connection with the securitisation of the majority of the Groups UK pubs and restaurants business owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd.
The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of 1,243m, pay issue costs of 23m and return 501m to shareholders by way of a special dividend.
On 15 September 2006 Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc completed the issue of 655m of further secured loan notes in the form of the A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes as detailed below.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation in November 2003.
The funds raised were mainly used to return 486m to shareholders by way of a special dividend and to provide long-term funding for the Whitbread pub restaurant sites acquired.
As part of the issue, the original A1 and A3 loan note tranches were repaid and reissued as A1N and A3N loan notes to take advantage of market rates.
At 25 September 2010 the loan notes consisted of 10 tranches as follows: Initial Effective principal interest Principal outstanding borrowed Principal repayment period rate at 25 September 2010 Expected a Tranche m Interest all by instalments % m WAL b A1N 200 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.83 200 10 years A2 550 Fixed 5.57% 2003 to 2028 6.01 372 10 years b c A3N 250 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.93 250 10 years b A4 170 Floating 2016 to 2028 5.24 170 3 years b AB 325 Floating 2020 to 2032 5.25 325 3 years B1 350 Fixed 5.97% 2003 to 2023 6.12 257 7 years B2 350 Fixed 6.01% 2015 to 2028 6.12 350 14 years C1 200 Fixed 6.47% 2029 to 2030 6.57 200 19 years b C2 50 Floating 2033 to 2034 5.44 50 3 years b D1 110 Floating 2034 to 2036 5.50 110 3 years c 2,555 2,284 Mitchells & Butlers plc 83 Annual report and accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2010 continued 18.

84 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies.
At 25 September 2010, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd had cash and cash equivalents of 214m 2009 91m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 128m 2009 15m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in an account over which there are a number of restrictions.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustees and may only be used for certain speci ed purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.
The carrying value of the securitised debt in the Group balance sheet at 25 September 2010 is analysed as follows: 2010 2009 m m Principal outstanding at beginning of period 2,342 2,353 Principal repaid during the period 46 45 Exchange on translation of dollar loan notes 3 34 Principal outstanding at end of period 2,299 2,342 Deferred issue costs 13 15 Accrued interest 3 4 Carrying value at end of period 2,289 2,331 At 25 September 2010 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities: 2010 2009 a Undrawn committed borrowing facilities m m Unutilised facilities expire: Within one year Between two and five years 167 167 167 167 a In addition to the undrawn amounts against the medium-term facility see below, the Group holds an undrawn 295m 2009 295m liquidity facility against the securitised arrangements, sized to cover 18 months debt service, which is not available for any other purpose.
This is not included in the table above.
This facility will expire on 6 September 2011.
Medium-term borrowing facilities On 24 July 2008, the Group entered into a three year 600m term and revolving credit facility the medium-term facility expiring on 30 November 2011, including a 300m revolving credit facility, for general business purposes which incurs interest at LIBOR plus a margin.
The facility was set at 600m initially but reduced to 550m in December 2008.
On 20 May 2009, the facility was amended to provide an additional 75m.
At the same time, 75m of the facility originally due for payment on 31 December 2009 was prepaid.
On 30 September 2009, a further 75m of the facility was prepaid and a further 50m on 2 March 2010, reducing the outstanding facility to 425m.
As at 25 September 2010 the Group had drawn an amount of 255m net of deferred issue costs against the facility which forms part of the Other borrowings balance 2009 376m net of deferred issue costs.

Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk management is the responsibility of the Groups Treasury function.
The Groups Treasury function is governed by a Board Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed at least annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group Treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies are set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, capital risk and market risk, principally as a result of changes in foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses the maturity pro le of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist primarily of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility and the medium-term funding facility drawn by Mitchells & Butlers Retail No.
2 Ltd. Further information regarding these arrangements is included in note 18.
The terms of both the securitisation and the medium-term facility contain a number of financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
Committed facilities outside of the securitisation are sized to ensure that the Group can meet its medium-term anticipated cash ow requirements.
86 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The maturity table below details the contractual, undiscounted cash ows both principal and interest for the Groups financial liabilities after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the analysis is calculated on the assumption that the Groups A4, AB, C2 and D1 securitised loan notes are re nanced on the margin step-up dates, however, the Group has an unconditional right to continue to hold individual loan note tranches through to their final maturity dates.
The cash ows of the A1N and A3N securitised loan notes are calculated on the assumption that they are not expected to be re nanced on their step-up dates and are held to maturity.

These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long-term and A1 P1 short-term.
Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level.
An amount of 32m 2009 18m of collateral was posted by a swap provider within the securitisation as at 25 September 2010.
This is excluded from cash and cash equivalents in note 26, but is included within Bank & cash in the credit exposure table below.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Exceptions are formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four weekly basis.
The Groups credit exposure as at 25 September 2010 was: 2010 2009 m m Bank & cash 230 95 a Other receivables 44 15 a The Group may have a right of offset against certain amounts held within this balance Mitchells & Butlers plc 87 Annual report and accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2010 continued 19.
Financial instruments continued Capital risk The Groups capital base is comprised of its net debt analysed in note 26 plus total equity disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet.
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is suf ciently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, including the amenity and cash ow generation of the pub estate.
By keeping debt compared to equity see also Funding and liquidity risk above and headroom against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its bank debts see page 85 note 18.
In managing its capital structure, from time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt pro le supports its strategic objectives.
Total capital at 25 September 2010 is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Net debt see note 26 2,302 2,600 Total equity 881 997 Total capital 3,183 3,597 Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of its financial instruments will uctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The group faces currency risk in two main areas: US$418.75m of Class A3N oating rate notes which form part of the securitised debt see note 18.
At issuance of the notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and interest elements of the notes.
The Group has no signi cant pro t and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no signi cant direct currency exposure from its operations.
Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of xed and oating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash ows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 2.3bn securitisation is xed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at xed interest rates, or through a combination of oating rate notes against which effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.
The Groups medium-term facility incurs oating rate interest based on LIBOR.
Drawings against this facility are partially hedged using interest rate swaps, with a notional principal amount of 150m see Cash ow hedges unsecured borrowings below.
These swaps qualify for hedge accounting and movements in their mark-to-market values are recognised directly in equity, with the cumulative gain or loss transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the hedged elements of the facility are recognised against pro t or loss.

The cash ow hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the financial period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a loss of 131m 2009 88m loss on cash ow hedges was recognised directly in equity.
A loss of 47m 2009 11m gain was removed from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Cash ow hedges securitised borrowings At 25 September 2010, the Group held 10 2009 10 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 1,105m 2009 1,105m, designated as a hedge of the cash ow interest rate risk of 1,105m 2009 1,105m of the Groups oating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash ows occur quarterly, receiving a oating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a xed rate of 4.8938% 2009 4.8938%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The 10 interest rate swaps above are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 195 m 2009 107 m liability.
At 25 September 2010 the Group held one 2009 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 250m 2009 250m, designated as a hedge of the cash ow interest rate and currency risk of the Groups A3N oating rate $418.75m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of 10m 2009 5m asset.
The cash ows occur quarterly, receiving a oating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a xed rate, in sterling, of 5.4445% 2009 5.4445%.
Cash ow hedges unsecured borrowings Between 11 and 12 June 2009, the Group entered into short dated interest rate swaps with a notional principal of 150m and a maturity date of 23 December 2010, which swap the LIBOR based oating interest rate on its medium-term nancing facility into a xed rate of 1.9788%.
The swaps, which limit the Groups exposure to short-term uctuations in the LIBOR element of drawings against the facility, meet the criteria for hedge accounting and are therefore accounted for as cash ow hedges.
The cash ows on the swaps are settled quarterly.
The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of nil 2009 2 m liability.

Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments closed out in the prior period Following a deterioration in the mark-to-market fide cit of the 225m hedge retained when the property joint venture discussions with R20 were aborted in 2008, the Group acquired forward starting swaps on 11 March 2009, which xed the economic fair value of the 225m swaps at an amount of approximately 95 m. The ongoing illiquidity in the long-term debt markets meant that re nancing the medium-term facility into a longer term facility was unlikely to be possible in the near future and as a result of this, on 20 May 2009, the Group closed out both the 225m swaps and the forward starting swaps at their fair value of 95 m excluding accrued interest.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are re ected on the balance sheet as follows.
These values were measured at 25 September 2010 and may be subject to material movements in the period subsequent to the balance sheet date.

90 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The various tranches of the securitised debt have been valued using period end quoted offer prices.
As the securitised debt is traded on an active market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties which approximate to their fair market value and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or book values approximate to fair values.

Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Operating and financial review on pages 5 to 25.
The financial position of the Group, its cash ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described within the review.
In addition, note 19 to the financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 18 to the financial statements, the Groups nancing is based upon securitised debt plus the medium-term borrowing facility that is due for renewal on 30 November 2011.
The Groups forecasts and projections updated following the completion of the disposal of 333 pubs to Stonegate for a consideration of 363m and, taking account of anticipated trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and so they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Contingent assets and liabilities The Group has given indemnities in respect of the disposal of certain companies previously within the Six Continents group.
It is the view of the Directors that such indemnities are not expected to result in financial loss to the Group.
