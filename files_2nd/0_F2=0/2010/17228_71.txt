The Company has also provided a guarantee in respect of Sterling and Euro Bonds, amounting to 818m 2009: 781m in respect of a subsidiary undertaking.
Where the Company enters into financial contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other Companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading OFT issued a Statement of Objections to a number of grocery retailers and milk producers, alleging collusion in the setting of prices for certain dairy products in 2002 and 2003.
The Board strongly believes that Morrisons has no case to answer and have made representations in detail to this effect.
Our view is unchanged by the Supplementary Statement of Objections issued by the OFT in July 2009.
The Board does not consider it probable that the Company will ultimately incur a fine and, accordingly, has made no provision for such liability.
The OFT also continues to investigate the market for the sale of tobacco, and in this case, there is a complex legal question as to whether well established industry practices represented a breach of competition law.
It is likely that this can only be settled through a formal judicial process.
The Board has not made a provision for such a liability.
