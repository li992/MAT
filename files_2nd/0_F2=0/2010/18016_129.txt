Financial statements 92 Notes to the accounts 2 Segmental reporting For management and reporting purposes the Group is organised into four operating divisions being The Great Capital Partnership, Earls Court & Olympia, Covent Garden and Other.
The Other segment primarily constitutes the Groups investments in China, the business unit historically known as Opportunities and head ofce companies.
This segment included a number of smaller assets located primarily in the south east of England which were sold during 2009.
The Earls Court & Olympia segment also includes the Groups interest in The Empress State Limited Partnership which holds the Empress State building adjacent to the Groups property at Earls Court.
The Groups operating segments derive their revenue primarily from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Earls Court & Olympia whose revenue primarily represents exhibition income.
Unallocated expenses are costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor reasonably attributable to individual segments.
