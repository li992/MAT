Due to the Companys tax status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval of such status in the foreseeable future, the Company and Group have not provided tax on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments held by the Company.
As a result of changes in the Finance Act 2009, Eligible Unrelieved Foreign Tax EUFT was abolished with effect from 1 July 2009 and as such no unrecognised Deferred Tax asset in relation to EUFT exists at the year end.
As at 30 April 2009, after offset against accrued revenue taxable on receipt, there was an unrecognised Deferred Tax asset of 1,102,000 in relation to EUFT.
No Deferred Tax asset was recognised at the time as it was considered unlikely the Company would generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise this asset.
