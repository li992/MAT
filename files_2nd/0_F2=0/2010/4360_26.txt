intangible assets are tested separately from goodwill only where impairment indicators exist.
The Group has no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Goodwill impairment losses recognised in the year were 3.2 million 2009 187.5 million.
when testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all the Groups cash-generating units cGus are measured at the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
value in use is calculated by discounting future expected cash flows.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on Management-approved budgets and projections which reflect Managements current experience and future expectations of the markets in which the cGu operates.
risk-adjusted discount rates used by the Group in its impairment tests range from 8.5% to 11.5% 2009 9.5% to 12.0%, the choice of rates depending on the market and maturity of the cGu.
The Groups estimate of the weighted average cost of capital has decreased from the previous year reflecting principally a 1% decrease in equity premium together with a reduction in bond yields.
The projections consist of Board-approved budgets for the following year, three-year plans and growth rates beyond this period.
The growth rates range between 0.0% and 3.0% 2009 0.0% and 5.0% and vary with managements view of the cGus market position, maturity of the relevant market and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which it operates.
Further disclosures in accordance with paragraph 134 of ias 36, impairment of assets, are provided where the Group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a cGu that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15.0% of the total net book value, in comparison with the Groups total carrying value of goodwill.
101 Daily Mail anD General TrusT plc annual reporT 2010 noTes To The consoliDaTeD sTaTeMenT oF Financial posiTion conTinueD 18 GooDwill continued The only significant item of goodwill included in the net book value above relates to Bca, a business within Metal Bulletin, which has a carrying value of 146.7 million 2009 144.6 million 2008 129.7 million together with intangible assets with a carrying value of 78.0 million 2009 84.1 million 2008 82.4 million.
The carrying value of Bca has been determined using a value-in-use calculation in line with ias 36.
The methodology applied to the value-in-use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including: i Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2011.
The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable.
ii subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business.
iii a discount rate of 8.5% and iv long-term nominal growth rates of 3%.
using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by 125.1 million.
For this business the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the cGu.
For the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying value then the discount rate would need to be increased by 5.9% or the long-term growth rate would need to be reduced by 7.2%.
The carrying values of the Groups significant items of goodwill in relation to material business combinations, which the Group considers to be those which have a purchase consideration in excess of 100.0 million, are further analysed as follows: Metal Bulletin plc m Cost At 28th September, 2008 185.5 exchange adjustment 14.9 At 4th October, 2009 200.4 exchange adjustment 2.2 At 3rd October, 2010 202.6 Metal Bulletin plc m Accumulated impairment losses At 28th September, 2008, 4th October, 2009 and 3rd October, 2010 2.8 net book value 2008 182.7 net book value 2009 197.6 Net book value 2010 199.8 The impairment reversal charge is analysed by major CGU as follows: intangible Goodwill asset 2010 2009 Discount impairment impairment Discount rate rate reason for impairment cGu segment m m % % reversal charge George little events 27.5 9.0% 11.0% a fall in long-term interest Management llc rates resulting in a reduction in Group wacc and improvement in the markets served by this business aBF euromoney 1.2 0.6 8.5% 9.5% reduced outlook due to business becoming loss-making in recent years autovia local media 0.6 11.5% 11.5% Deterioration in market conditions Tau-online local media 0.8 11.5% 11.5% Deterioration in market conditions 1.4 Jobsgroup national 1.1 10.0% 12.0% reduced outlook due to poor media market conditions loot national 1.4 10.0% 12.0% reduced outlook due to poor media market conditions 1.1 1.4 other 0.9 1.0 Group total 3.2 23.1 recoverable amounts have been determined using value-in-use calculations for all of the above cGus.

The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the effective interest method.
The unamortised issue costs amount to 4.5 million 2009 3.1 million 2008 3.4 million, the unamortised premia 13.6 million 2009 13.9 million 2008 15.2 million.
The fair value of the Groups bonds have been calculated on the basis of quoted market rates.
Further details of the Groups borrowing arrangements are set out in the Financial and Treasury report on pages 29 to 33.
Loan notes The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates of approximately liBiD to liBiD minus 1%.
The loan notes are repayable at the option of the loan note holders with a six-month notice period and are treated as current liabilities.
32 Financial insTruMenTs anD risK ManaGeMenT The Group is exposed to credit, interest rate and currency risks arising in the normal course of business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Full details of the Groups treasury policies are set out in the Financial and Treasury review on pages 32 to 33.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital, defined as equity shareholders funds and net borrowings, to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns for the foreseeable future.
Further details of the Groups strategy for capital risk management are set out in the Financial and Treasury report on pages 29 to 33.
Debt management The Group borrows on an unsecured basis and arranges its debt to ensure an appropriate maturity profile.
The Groups principal sources of funding are the long-term sterling bond market and committed bank facilities.
The Group is mindful of its credit rating, currently BB, and ensures it has sufficient committed bank facilities in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account the Groups holding of cash and cash equivalents together with any distribution restrictions which exist.
The Group aims to maximise the term and flexibility of indebtedness and retain headroom in the form of undrawn committed bank facilities of approximately 100.0 million.
additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The Directors consider that the Groups bond issuances together with its bank facilities will be sufficient to cover the likely medium-term cash requirements of the Group.
associates, joint ventures and other investments in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding requirements.
in all cases such financing is non-recourse to the company.
The Groups interim internal target of net debt to eBiTDa cover is 2.5 times whilst the limit imposed by its bank covenants is no greater than 4 times.
The actual ratio for the year was 2.31 times 2009 2.99 times 2008 2.59 times.
Cash and liquidity risk management The Group monitors cash balances and ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet entities operational requirements.
short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to credit risk.
Market risk management The Groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Interest rate risk management The limit imposed by the Groups bank covenants is at least 3 times eBiTDa to net interest.
The actual ratio for the year was 4.91 times 2009 4.45 times 2008 5.20 times.

Group policy is to have 70% to 80% of interest exposures fixed with the balance floating.
This is achieved by issuing fixed-rate sterling bond debt and entering into derivative contracts that economically swap fixed rate interest into floating rate.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
The derivatives in place to meet Group policy are as follows: i Fixed to floating interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the Groups bonds: changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognised in the income statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for movements in the hedged risk to the extent effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the income statement.
These interest rate swaps amount to 75.0 million 2009 75.0 million 2008 75.0 million with the Group paying floating rates of between 1.24% and 3.60% 2009 1.99% and 6.03% 2008 2.38% and 5.85%.
ii cross-currency fixed to fixed interest rate swaps.
These amounted to 227.6 million us$435.0 million 2009 227.6 million us$435.0 million 2008 255.5 million us$ 485.0 million resulting in the Group paying fixed us dollar interest at rates of between 4.40% and 6.07% 2009 4.40% and 6.07% 2008 5.38% and 5.85%, 8.5 million aus$20.0 million 2009 18.8 million aus$45.0 million 2008 18.8 million aus$45.0 million with the Group paying fixed australian dollar interest at rates of between 6.15% and 6.22% 2009 6.15% and 6.22% 2008 6.15% and 6.22%.
iii The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement costs calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 3rd october, 2010.
The fair value of long-term borrowings has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Foreign exchange rate risk management Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in entities with functional currencies other than that of the parent company.
The net asset exposures are economically hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably us dollars.
The Group also designates currency swaps and forward contracts as net investment hedges, hedging the Groups overseas investments.
Credit risk management The Groups principal credit risk relates to its trade and other receivables and non-performance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts.
Trade and other receivables The Groups customer base is diversified geographically and by division with customers generally of a good financial standing.
Before accepting any new customers, the Group assesses the potential customers credit quality and sets credit limits by customer.
The average credit period is 44 days 2009 48 days 2008 51 days.
The Group considers the credit risk of trade receivables to be low, although the Group remains vigilant in the current economic climate.
The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although the Group does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances.
The Group makes an allowance for bad and doubtful debts specific to individual debts.
This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historic payment profiles and past default experience.
The Groups receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful debts and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Institutional counterparty risk The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks, described above, by the use of financial instruments.
as a result, credit risk arises from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to those financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Group policy is to have no more than 20.0 million deposited or at risk with any aa counterparty, 10.0 million for a-rated counterparties.
credit risk is controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them.
The Group has no significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered low since the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.

all cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 3rd october, 2010. all amounts deferred in equity at the year end are expected to impact the income statement in the next 18 months when the related cashflows are expected to occur.
Net investment hedges The Group enters into forward currency sales and cross-currency swaps to hedge the Groups investment in foreign operations.
all net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 3rd october, 2010.
Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting represent forward contracts which provide a gain or loss equivalent to income tax payable or receivable on foreign exchange gains or losses incurred when intra group balances are translated to the closing rate at the year end.
These contracts Tax equalisation swaps are marked to market with the movement in fair value taken to income.
Tax equalisation swaps are not capable of being designated as hedging instruments under ias 39.

127 Daily Mail anD General TrusT plc annual reporT 2010 noTes To The consoliDaTeD sTaTeMenT oF Financial posiTion conTinueD 33 reTireMenT BeneFiTs The Group operates a number of pension schemes covering most major Group companies under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The schemes include funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, based on final pensionable salary in addition to a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The defined benefit schemes in the uK and some defined contribution plans are administered by trustees or trustee companies.
The Group has been progressively introducing a number of pensionsaver group personal pension plans to provide a consistent pensions saving vehicle across all Group divisions.
These plans have replaced the trust-based defined contribution arrangements which are now in the final stages of being wound up.
The assets of all the pension schemes and plans are held independently from the Groups finances.
The total net pension costs of the Group for the year ended 3rd october, 2010 were 27.7 million 2009 1.1 million net income.
Defined Benefit Schemes Following the changes announced last year affecting the harmsworth pension scheme, the Group announced in september 2010 that a similar limit on future pay increases counting towards pension will apply to all the significant defined benefit schemes of the Group.
The Groups proposals will mean that accrued and future benefits in these schemes will increase at or below the prevailing rate of inflation, with inflation capped at 5%.
This has resulted in an exceptional credit to pension costs in respect of the defined benefit schemes of 9.9 million in the year ended 3rd october, 2010 2009, 27.4 million.
The company continues to develop a series of measures principally designed to limit the companys exposure to people living longer than is currently expected.
These measures have been discussed with scheme trustees and a formal process of employee consultation will begin in December 2010.
The Group expects that this package of changes will secure the future of the schemes, which will continue to provide a valuable retirement provision for scheme members.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the actuary using the projected unit credit method.
work in connection with the actuarial valuation of the main schemes as at 31st March, 2010 has commenced and the provisional results are expected to become available towards the end of 2010 with a funding agreement between the company and trustees in place by the statutory deadline, June 2011.
The figures in this note are based on calculations using membership data as at 30th september, 2010, along with asset valuations and cash flow information from the schemes for the year to 3rd october, 2010.
The funding strategy agreed with the trustees of the principal schemes in connection with the 2007 valuation made allowance for assumed future investment returns on the schemes assets of 3.3 % p. a. above price inflation, compared with the real return of some 2.6 % p. a. implicit within the calculation of the technical provisions i. e. the value of the schemes benefit liabilities.
The company agreed with the trustees that this margin would be covered by a contingent asset and the company put in place letters of credit of an amount sufficient to cover any potential shortfall in this additional investment return arising prior to the next triennial valuation.
as at 3rd october, 2010, the letters of credit had a value of 54.5 million 2009 32.1 million.
post year-end, on 5th october, 2010, the Group made funding payments to the main schemes totalling 10.0 million in exchange for which the trustees agreed that the value of the letters of credit could be reduced by a corresponding amount.
cash contributions paid by the company to the principal scheme as required by the schedule of contributions remain at the same level of 18.0 % of members scheme salaries 2009 18.0 % with employees contributing either 5.0 % or 7.5 % depending on which section of the scheme they are in.
however, since 1st January, 2009 a majority of members have agreed to a salary sacrifice arrangement whereby the company pays the equivalent of the employees contribution in exchange for a corresponding reduction in salary.
in addition, the company agreed to make a series of funding payments amounting to 3.2 million over a period of 27 months commencing in september, 2009. in the year to 3rd october, 2010 the Group paid 1.0 million in accordance with that agreement 2009, 1.0 million.
at 3rd october, 2010, the defined benefit obligation to the Group relating to the DMGT avc plan, as measured for the purposes of this disclosure under the requirements of ias19, was 61.8 million 2009 60.9 million.
The assets of the plan were 52.1 million 2009 51.5 million, producing a deficit of 9.7 million 2009 9.4 million deficit.
The plan is closed to further member contributions.
The triennial valuation of the plan showed that the combined accumulated assets as at 31st March, 2008 represented 100.0% of the plans technical provisions in respect of past service benefits.
in common with the majority of defined benefit schemes there was a sharp deterioration in the funding position of the plan over the following 12 months with the funding level, measured on a technical provisions basis, falling to 80.0% as at 31st March, 2009. however, recent quarterly updates provided to the Trustee indicate that the funding position has since improved.
The Group has not been required to make contribution payments in respect of the plan.
The next actuarial valuation of the plan is due to take place as at 31st March, 2011.
Members of the defined benefit schemes are able to make additional voluntary contributions avcs into unit-linked funds held within each scheme.
no benefit obligation arises to the Group from these avcs and the related unit-linked avc assets have been excluded from the scheme assets reported in the following tables.

having taken account of the rules of the schemes, the fact that the schemes remain open to new accrual, and the current and anticipated levels of service cost and cash contributions, the company considers that recognition of surpluses in the schemes on its statement of Financial position is in accordance with the interpretations of iFric 14. in 2010 and 2009 all schemes were in deficit.
in 2008, the two main schemes were in deficit, the Metal Bulletin scheme was in surplus and the DMGT avc plan had its assets capped to the value of the liabilities.
The deficit for the year, set out above, excludes a related deferred tax asset of 73.3 million 2009 120.5 million 2008 11.5 million.

The trust deed of each of the schemes explicitly prohibits investment of the scheme assets in employer-related investments, apart from those required in order that a passively managed uK equity portfolio can be utilised by the trustees.
The value of DMGT a ordinary non-voting shares held by pooled fund managers on behalf of the schemes at 3rd october, 2010 was 0.1 million 2009 0.1 million, 2008 0.2 million.
The assumption for the expected overall rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class based on the proportion of assets held in each class at the beginning of the year.
The expected return on bonds has been selected having regard to gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
The expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of estimated risk premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields on bonds, and consensus economic forecasts for future returns.
The actual return on plan assets was 188.6 million 2009 loss of 51.7 million 2008 loss of 219.9 million representing the expected return plus the associated actuarial gain or loss during the year.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following table: 52 weeks 53 weeks 52 weeks ending ending ending 28th 3rd october, 4th october, september, 2010 2009 2008 % % % price inflation 3.10 3.10 3.70 salary increases 2.90 3.00 4.20 pension increases 2.90 3.00 3.70 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.00 5.40 7.00 expected overall rate of return on assets 6.60 7.00 7.50 The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the period end date on high-quality corporate bonds.
The assumption for salary growth has been adjusted to take account of the limit on the extent to which expected future pay increases will count towards pension accrued and being earned in the schemes.
all assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on medium cohort projections but with a minimum rate of reduction in mortality rates in future of 1% per annum.
allowance is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement and for the proportion of members with dependants at retirement eligible for a pension.

of these assets, 41.9 million will expire between 2017 and 2029.
The remaining assets have no expiry date.
included in the credit to income of 31.2 million 2009 68.7 million is 0.5 million 2009 15.4 million relating to discontinued operations.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 89.2 million 2009 68.0 million 2008 24.0 million which relates to trading losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.

There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset relating to capital losses carried forward of 42.2 million 2009 23.6 million 2008 29.4 million.
no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 68.2 million 2009 52.9 million 2008 621.8 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 3rd october, 2010 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the uK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of a dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
The uK government has announced a future decrease in the uK corporation tax rate from 27.0 % to 24.0 % over the next three years.
The impact of these proposed rate changes would be to reduce the uK deferred tax assets included within noncurrent assets from 104.2 million to 92.6 million if they were all to reverse at 24.0 %.

Capital Appreciation Plan 2010 CAP 2010 The cap 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 21st January, 2010 and is a revised version of and replaces the previously approved cap 2009. cap 2010 is the direct replacement for cap 2004 as no further awards may be granted under cap 2004. each cap 2010 award comprises two equal elements an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share, and a right to receive a cash payment.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards become exercisable on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and lapse to the extent unexercised by 30th september, 2020.
The second tranche of awards becomes exercisable in a subsequent financial year in which the profits achieved in the year of initial vesting are again achieved.
The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and an additional performance condition.
The number of options received under the share award of the cap 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 company share option plan see below.
The cap 2010 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present value of expected future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise.
The expected term of the option used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The csop 2010 uK was approved by hM revenue and customs on 21st June, 2010 and granted on 28th June, 2010.
The csop 2010 uK option enables each participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the company at a price of 6.03 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the cap 2010 providing the csop option is in the money at that time and does not vest before 28th June, 2013.
The csop 2010 canada, granted on 30th March, 2010, enables each participant to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the company at a price of 5.01 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
no option may vest after the date falling three months after the preliminary announcement of the results for the financial year ended 30th september, 2019, and the option shall lapse to the extent unvested at the time.
The csop has the same performance criteria as that of the cap 2010 as set out above.
The number of csop 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the cap 2010, the csop effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the cap 2010 award.
The csop 2010 option exercise price of 6.03 uK and 5.01 canada will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism and results in the same net gain on the csop options calculated as the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the award had been delivered using 0.0025 cap options.

The csop 2010 options have an exercise price of 6.031, which will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which results in the same net gain on these options delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the same award had been delivered using 0.0025 cap options.
The amount of the funding award will depend on the companys share price at the date of exercise.
Because of the above and the other direct links between the csop 2010 and the cap 2010, including the identical performance criteria, iFrs 2 share based payments combines the two plans and treats them as one plan vesting in two tranches.
as such the long term incentive expense recognised in the year for the csop 2010 and cap 2010 options including the charge in relation to the cash element was 3,947,000 2009 nil.
1. exercise price of canadian csop is 5.01.
2. net gain on the csop options is the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price 6.031 multiplied by the number of options exercised.
exercise price excludes the effect of the funding award.
