Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information 67 Business review Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 26 August 2010: As expected this has been a year of challenges and opportunities.
Our performance was much stronger in the second half than in the fi first: our performance in the developing markets drove overall growth while markets in North America and Europe remained weak.
However, even though markets and categories have been aff ected in diff erent ways and to diff ering degrees, we have been consistent in our focus to deliver growth and build a stronger business for the future.
We increased marketing in growing categories, delivering 5% organic net sales growth in scotch and 5% organic net sales growth in beer, and in growing markets with organic marketing spend up 13% in International, and behind our leading brands especially Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Captain Morgan.
As a result we have outperformed and delivered share gains across most of our biggest markets.
We launched innovations to meet the opportunities which changing consumer and customer trends off er.
We have invested to strengthen our routes to market especially in Asia and we are building industry leading customer marketing skills in the on and off trade with our key customers.
We have delivered very strong cash fl ow and return on invested capital increased to 14.8%.
The impact of the global economic crisis varied by market and the strength of the recovery appears to be equally variable.
However, as we demonstrated this year, the global diversity of our business, together with the strength and range of our brands and the agility we have demonstrated gives us confi dence that in fi scal 2011 we will be able to improve on the organic operating profi t growth we have delivered this year.
We are recommending a 6% increase in the fi final dividend and expect to at least maintain this rate of dividend growth in fi scal 2011.

These funds have generally been used to pay interest, taxes and dividend, and to fund capital expenditure, acquisitions and share repurchases.
Net cash from operating activities Cash generated from operations increased from 2,654 million in the year ended 30 June 2009 to 3,184 million in the year ended 30 June 2010.
This increase of 530 million primarily arose from an increase of 156 million in operating profi t, an increase of 587 million in cash fl ows from net movements in working capital, partly off set by a reduction of 63 million in the dividend received from Mot Hennessy.
Cash generated from operations is after exceptional restructuring costs of 145 million 2009 53 million: 2008 4 million.
The reduction in working capital of 334 million 2009 increase of 253 million was mainly achieved through initiatives to improve the collection of receivables and by agreeing new payment terms with certain suppliers.
In the year ended 30 June 2010 inventories increased by 104 million 2009 236 million: 2008 202 million principally in respect of maturing inventories to satisfy forecast demand.
Other items include 114 million of cash contributions to post employment schemes in excess of the income statement charge 2009 68 million higher contributions: 2008 13 million lower contributions and gains on sale of property, included in operating profi t, of 89 million 2009 6 million: 2008 24 million partly off set by the fair value charge in respect of share-based incentive plans of 31 million 2009 31 million: 2008 26 million.
Net interest payable in the year ended 30 June 2010 was 110 million lower than the year ended 30 June 2009 primarily due to lower interest rates on fl oating rate debt and the receipt of 113 million following the renegotiation of the terms of certain interest rate swaps.
Tax payments in the years ended 30 June 2010 and 2009 were higher than in the year ended 30 June 2008 primarily as a result of settlements agreed with tax authorities paid over two years.
Net cash from investing activities The purchase of tangible fi xed assets and computer software increased from 355 million in the year ended 30 June 2009 to 374 million in the year ended 30 June 2010.

In addition, the wineries associated with the land have been sold to the same third party and leased back for the same period.

This included 123 million deposited with Chinas securities depositary and clearing agency, Shanghai branch in connection with a possible tender off er to the shareholders of Sichuan ShuiJingFang Co. Ltd. see note 31 f to the consolidated fi financial statements.

Capital structure and targeted credit rating The groups management is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both by investing in the businesses and brands so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital effi ciency, maximise fl exibility and give the appropriate level of access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
This is achieved by targeting a range of ratios which are currently broadly consistent with a single A credit rating.
Diageo would consider modifying these ratios in order to eff ect strategic initiatives within its stated goals, which could have an impact on its rating.

Borrowings The group policy with regard to the expected maturity profi le of borrowings is to limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, it is group policy to maintain backstop facility terms from relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
The groups net borrowings and gross borrowings in the tables below are measured at amortised cost with the exception of borrowings designated in fair value hedge relationships, interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency swaps and forwards.
For borrowings designated in fair value hedge relationships, Diageo recognises a fair value adjustment for the risk being hedged in the balance sheet, whereas interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency swaps and forwards are measured at fair value.
Net borrowings, reported on this basis, comprise the following: 30 June 2010 2009 2008 million million million Overdrafts 55 68 31 Other borrowings due within one year 532 822 1,632 Borrowings due within one year 587 890 1,663 Borrowings due between one and three years 2,189 1,537 802 Borrowings due between three and fi five years 2,732 2,747 1,765 Borrowings due after fi five years 3,256 3,401 2,978 Fair value of foreign currency swaps and forwards 227 170 29 Fair value of interest rate hedging instruments 191 93 27 Finance lease liabilities 61 21 9 Gross borrowings 8,407 8,333 7,161 Off set by: Cash and cash equivalents 1,453 914 714 Net borrowings 6,954 7,419 6,447 Based on average monthly net borrowings and interest charge, the eff ective interest rate for the year ended 30 June 2010 was 4.8% 2009 6.2%: 2008 5.9%.
For this calculation, the interest charge excludes fi finance charges unrelated to net borrowings, the forward element on derivative fi financial instruments and fair value adjustments to interest rate swaps and borrowings.
Net borrowings designated in net investment hedge relationships amounted to 5,451 million as at 30 June 2010 2009 5,266 million: 2008 5,396 million.
