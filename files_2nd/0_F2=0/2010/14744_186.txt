Details of the capital management objectives, policies and procedures are included in the Financial Management section of the Business Statement of this report.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
The use of share buy-backs is the Groups benchmark for investment decisions and is utilised at times when management believe the Groups shares are undervalued.
No share buy-back was made during the year.
On 7 January 2009, the Group conducted a book-built, non-pre-emptive placing of 42.0 million new Ordinary Shares.
The shares were placed at a price of 11.40 each which was within 1% of the average closing price of the shares in the preceding four weeks.
Based on the price, the gross proceeds of the placing were 479.0m, representing approximately 4.8% of the Groups share capital.
The shares carried the right to the interim dividend paid on 27 March 2009 and carry the right to subsequent dividend.
The placing of shares was one of a series of steps taken which reflects the Groups flexible and prudent approach to financing investment.
It also enhanced the Groups future options by providing additional sources of funding for appropriate investment and acquisition opportunities.
In summary, the Groups intent is to balance returns to shareholders between correct returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth.
In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the correct economic environment prudently.
