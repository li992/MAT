Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred income taxation Deferred income taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or liability.
Deferred income taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred income taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments The Company operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
These include awards made in respect of shares in the then Charter plc exchanged for awards in respect of shares in the Company, following the Scheme of Arrangement establishing the Company as the holding company of the then Charter plc in 2008.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
The Companys liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is remeasured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payment, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent Charter International plc, the Company has recognised an addition to xed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions of 1.1 million 2009: 1.0 million with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders funds.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the period when paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment has been established and is unconditional.
