Key management compensation includes nil 2009: 0.4m share based payment charge.
4 Pension schemes Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2009 for the main UK and Irish schemes and 31 December 2008 for the secondary UK scheme.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
On 1 April 2008, the main UK scheme became a salary sacrifice scheme with membership being on an opt out basis, whereby the Group contributes into the scheme on behalf of the employees.
On 1 January 2009, the second UK scheme also became a salary sacrifice scheme, again on an opt out basis.
The employer contributed an extra 1.6m above its scheduled contributions in the year 2009: nil in order not to disinvest funds from its equity holding whilst the stock markets were recovering from the economic slow down.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates two defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the scheme administrators.
On 1 January 2009, the UK scheme became a salary sacrifice scheme on an opt out basis, whereby the Group contributes into the scheme on behalf of the employees.
During the year, the Group contributed 1.9m 2009: 1.2m to the defined contribution schemes.
The outstanding contributions as at 31 March 2010 were nil 2009: nil.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2010 2009 % % Discount rate 5.60 6.60 Expected return on scheme assets 7.40 8.05 1 Future salary increases 3.50 3.85 Future pension increases 3.25 2.85 Inflation 3.50 2.85 Proportion of employees opting for early retirement Nil Nil 1 1.25% 2009:1.95% for next three years reverting to 3.50% 2009: 3.85% after this period.
A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease the deficit by 9.1m and a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the deficit by 9.6m.
The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate defined benefit liabilities at 31 March are: 2010 2009 Current pensioners at age 65 male 21.7 21.7 Current pensioners at age 65 female 24.1 24.1 Future pensioners at age 65 male 22.7 22.7 Future pensioners at age 65 female 24.9 24.9 62 62 The BSS Gr The BSS Group plc oup plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 The BSS Gr The BSS Group plc oup plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 63 63 4 Pension schemes continued The total amount recognised for the defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Fair value of scheme assets 157.0 105.9 Value of insured pensions 1.0 0.8 Present value of defined benefit obligation 184.2 137.6 26.2 30.9 Unrecognised past service costs Net liability recognised in balance sheet 26.2 30.9 Amount recognised in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Current service cost 2.7 3.2 Interest cost 9.0 9.7 Expected return on scheme assets 8.6 10.2 3.1 2.7 Amount recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Actuarial gains losses 2.0 19.2 The change in the scheme deficit is primarily due to an increase in inflation and decreasing AA corporate bond yields.
This has been offset by a better than expected investment performance driven by the recovery in the equity markets.
The cumulative gain recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is 20.3m 2009: 18.3m.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Opening defined benefit obligation 137.6 152.8 Current service cost 2.7 3.2 Interest cost 9.0 9.7 Scheme participants contributions 0.3 0.3 Actuarial loss gain 40.5 25.8 Benefits paid 5.7 3.5 Foreign currency exchange rate changes on foreign scheme 0.2 0.9 Closing defined benefit obligation 184.2 137.6 Changes in the fair value of the scheme assets are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Opening fair value of scheme assets 106.7 139.7 Expected return 8.6 10.2 Actuarial gain loss 42.5 45.0 Contributions by employer 5.7 4.3 Scheme participants contributions 0.3 0.3 Benefits paid 5.7 3.5 Foreign currency exchange rate changes in foreign schemes 0.1 0.7 Closing fair value of scheme assets 158.0 106.7 The fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date is analysed as follows: 2010 2010 2009 2009 m % m % Equity securities 140.6 89.0 93.3 87.4 Debt securities 11.5 7.3 8.2 7.7 Property 4.2 2.6 3.6 3.4 Cash and other 1.7 1.1 1.6 1.5 158.0 100.0 106.7 100.0 62 62 The BSS Gr The BSS Group plc oup plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 The BSS Gr The BSS Group plc oup plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 63 63 Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 4 Pension schemes continued The actual gain loss on scheme assets over 2010 was 51.1m 2009: 34.8 m. The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices published by the London Stock Exchange.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolio.

It will be paid on 30 July 2010 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 2 July 2010.
There are no income tax consequences in respect of the dividends declared, but not recognised in the financial statements.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year excluding those held as Treasury shares which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Impairment review During the year management has carried out an impairment review for the goodwill carried in the balance sheet.
No impairments were identified as a result of the review.
All of the recoverable amounts were based on value in use.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: cash flow projections are based on Board approved budgets for the financial year ending 2011 and three year plan for 2011 to 2013 long term growth rates of between 2 and 4%, in line with Government GDP forecast growth rates a pre tax discount rate of 5.00% 2009: 4.02% which has been applied to each cash-generating unit as they each have a similar risk profile there are three cash-generating units which are disclosed in the segmental information note The Directors are confident that the assumptions used above are reasonable, although it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the assumptions were amended significantly.

Included within this balance is 6.6m attributed to the BuckHickman InOne brand name Roebuck, and 3.9m attributed to the Birchwood brands, Defender, Scruffs, Van Vault and Rhino, which are considered to have an indefinite life.
The Roebuck brand name has been trading for over a 100 years and therefore it is considered to have an indefinite life and is reviewed annually for impairment.
The Birchwood brand names have been trading for over 20 years and the product lines are consistently updated to meet market demands.
Therefore the brands are considered to have an indefinite life and are reviewed annually for impairment.

Before accepting any new customer the Group uses a bespoke credit scoring system, designed in house and tailored specifically for the industry which is backed up by an external Credit Reference Agency, to assess the potential customers credit quality.
The Group reserves the right to set credit limits by customer.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, 8.5m 2009: 7.4m is due from the Groups largest customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.

In order to protect itself against currency movements and interest rate exposures, the Group entered into three cross currency and three interest rate swaps.
g Fair values For both the Group and the Company the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing rates at 31 March.
There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed with the exception of the US$ Loan notes.
Movements in the fair value of the related financial instruments used to hedge against interest and currency risk are disclosed in note 16. h Guarantees and security No debt is secured, except for that relating to 0.3m 2009: 0.1m of finance lease obligations, which are secured on the assets subject to the leases.
There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts and ancillary banking facilities between the Group companies.

16 Derivative and non-current financial instruments Significant accounting policies Details of significant accounting policies and methods of valuation adopted by the Group in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Statement of Accounting Policies on page 56.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 19, 21 and 22 respectively.
The Groups senior management team review the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital are considered.
Based upon these reviews the structure of the capital can be altered by payment of dividends, new share issues, share buy-backs or by issuing or repaying debt.
The Group has set limits which are approved by the shareholders for the number of shares that can be allotted within a five year period.
The compliance with this limit is reviewed by the Board prior to any new grant of share options taking place.
The Group also has limits approved by the shareholders for share buy-backs or rights issues.
The Articles of Association limit the amount of borrowings the Group has at any one time to two times the adjusted net assets of the Group.
Through the covenants set out in the RCF agreement and US loan note agreements, the maximum amount of borrowings the Group can have outstanding is limited.
Compliance with the covenants is monitored on a half yearly basis or in conjunction with a significant change in the business.

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices The fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based upon discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions The fair value of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available use is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.

These risks include currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the exposures where necessary.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups treasury policies developed in conjunction with the Board.
Compliance with the policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis by quarterly reports from the Treasury function and monthly Credit Committee meetings.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Interest rate management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and the remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts as at the reporting date: Fair value hedges Average contracted floating interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value || || Restated 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Outstanding floating for fixed contracts % % m m m m Two five years 1.49 5.07 43.1 43.1 11.3 15.7 The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
The interest rate swaps manage the Groups exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US Dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 11 May 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps on the seven year borrowing of 29m and 14m that convert the borrowings on $50m and $25m respectively from 5.8% to a variable rate on six month LIBOR plus a basis point increment of 64.75 and 66.79 respectively.
A further interest rate swap on the ten year borrowing of 29m converts the borrowing on the $50m debt from 5.91% to a fixed rate of 4.7% plus a basis point increment of 70.75.
The interest rate swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest for floating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 4.7m 2009: 18.0 m, which was included in profit or loss at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap 4.4 m 2009: 18.1m was included in profit or loss.

The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and fixed interest on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from movements in exchange rates.
The interest rate swaps and the interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
At 31 March 2010 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate after more than five years from the balance sheet date, was estimated at 5.8m 2009: 9.8m.
This amount is based upon the market values of equivalent financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof deferred in equity.
Foreign currency risk management In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the private placing of $125m, the Group has entered into three cross currency swaps to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire duration of the private placement.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the private placement to 72m as well as fixing the exchange rates applicable to future coupon payments.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in Sterling are paid for principally in US Dollars and Euros.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than twelve months in duration to buy US Dollars and Euros to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$1.2m and nil 2009: US$5.5m and 0.4m.
The average exchange rate of the US Dollar contracts is 1.509 2009: 1.487 and the Euro contracts is nil 2009: 1.115.
The fair value of these derivatives is nil 2009: 0.1m and nil respectively.
These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
Liquidity risk management The Board has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding requirements.
The Group manages the risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and financial liabilities.
Included in note 15 is a list of additional undrawn committed facilities that the Group has to further reduce liquidity risk.
The following tables detail the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.

A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to senior management and represents the Directors assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If the interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: Profit for the year ended 31 March 2010 would have decreased increased by 1.0m 2009: decreased increased by 1.2m Net equity would have decreased increased by 1.0m 2009: decreased increased by 1.2m Other derivatives The BSS Group plc has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.

However, due to restrictions on how these losses can be used, the Directors do not believe it is probable that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 0.7m in respect of trading losses relating to UGS Ltd with no expiry date, due to potential restrictions on how these losses can be used.

The property dilapidation provision represents the estimated costs of dilapidation repairs which have arisen over the period of the Groups occupation of leasehold property, the liability for which is contained in a tenancy agreement.
Provision is only made where the repair can be legally enforced and it is likely that the obligation will result in a outflow of economic benefit.
These liabilities will crystallise over the period of the lease.
The property dilapidation provision is for properties which have a remaining lease period of up to three years.
