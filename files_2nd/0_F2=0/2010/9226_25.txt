The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 32 of the consolidated IFRSs financial statements.
In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc market conditions.
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.

The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The guarantees expire between 2010 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is 901.2 million 31 December 2009: 933.0 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 505.9 million 31 December 2009: 517.2 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 395.3 million 31 December 2009: 415.8 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The undiscounted maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2010 is 385.9 million 31 December 2009: 407.7 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 193.4 million 31 December 2009: 201.0 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 192.5 million 31 December 2009: 206.7 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
At 31 December 2010 the Company has recognised a financial liability of 8.1 million 31 December 2009: 9.3 million in respect of these guarantees.
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity at 31 December 2010 2009: nil.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate.
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 1.5 million.

Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 10 7 Financial statements Statutory reports and financial statements Notes to the company financial statements continued 15 Pensions The Companys main pension plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007, with the next valuation as at 30 June 2010 currently in process.
The latest actuarial valuation was updated to 31 December 2010 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
In July 2010, the Government announced that in future statutory indexation for pensions would be linked to the Consumer Prices Index CPI rather than the, historically, higher Retail Prices Index RPI.
On the basis of legal advice, the Company has assessed that this change will act to reduce the Companys pension liabilities.
To reflect this, in 2010 the Company has recognised an actuarial gain of 8.6 million outside profit and loss through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the plan.
The table also sets out at 31 December 2010, 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus or deficit of assets compared to the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability or asset and the net pension asset or liability.

The sources used to determine the expected rates of return include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
The contributions made by the employers in 2009, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were 6.7 million 2009: 7.0 million.
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 20.5% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional 133,333 per month to remove the shortfall in funding identified at 30 September 2007 and 62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan.
These lead to an expected contribution of 6.6 million in 2011.
As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase over time as the average age of the membership increases.
