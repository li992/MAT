Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC Notes to the Financial Statements 61 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 For the year ended 3 April 2010 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover of this document.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 3 and in the Business and Financial Review on pages 8 to 15.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The new International Financial Reporting Standards adopted during the year were IFRS 8 Operating Segments and IAS 1 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements.
See Note 3 for consideration of the impact of IFRS 8.
IAS 1 revised 2007 requires the presentation of a third balance sheet for 2008 because a new standard became effective in the year.
However as there is no change to the 2008 balance sheet, a third balance sheet would add no value so has not been included within the financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised 2008 Investments in Associates IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Improvements to IFRSs issued April 2009 The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
In their consideration of going concern, the Directors have reviewed the Groups cashflow forecasts and associated risks: these forecasts extend for a period beyond one year from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Additional details are set out on page 43.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 3 April 2010.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
No income statement is presented for Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC, as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Companys profit for the financial year, determined in accordance with the Act was 21,061,000 2009 59,310,000.
The separate financial statements of the Company, excluding the Income Statement, are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in this note.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC 62 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Goodwill continued Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal, but is recorded as a movement on reserves.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Discounts, including overrider and retrospective rebates, are recognised as deductions from revenue in the same period as the related sales.
Discounts not yet invoiced are recorded within accrued and deferred income.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the date of acquisition or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly through the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary items are included in net profit or loss for the period.
The transactions referred to are primarily payables in respect of purchases of plant and equipment along with packaging materials.
Non-monetary assets are recorded at the historic rate and are not re-translated.
Borrowing Costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating Profit Operating profit is stated after any gains on the sale of property but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement Benefit Costs The Group operates a Group Personal Pension Scheme and a small defined contribution pension scheme.
Contributions to these schemes are charged as an expense in the period during which they fall due.
The Group was responsible for the Aberdeen Milk Services Limited Pension Scheme which is a hybrid scheme: however, the Scheme commenced a wind up process on 23 October 2007 following transfer of the liability to Legal & General.
Further details are set out in Note 32.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in the statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC 63 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Property, Plant and Equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at their historical cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Properties in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
All other tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 2%4% Plant and machinery 10%33% Motor vehicles 10%20% Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Software Development Costs An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups software development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: An asset is created that can be separately identified such as software and new processes : It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of 3 to 5 years.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Excluding Goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the greater of realisable value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future economic benefits attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is control over the use of the asset.
Where the Group acquires a business, other intangible assets such as customer lists are identified and evaluated to determine the fair value on the acquisition balance sheet.
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 1 and 10 years.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the First In First Out method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC 64 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other Financial Liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Trade Payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge these exposures.
Such derivatives are initially recorded at cost, if any, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of hedges and derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Share-based Payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value of all equity settled share based payments is measured using either the Black Scholes model or a Monte Carlo Simulation dependent upon whether the shares have an external criterion or not.
Fair value of LTIPs is measured using the Binomial model.
For cash settled share-based payments a liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date The Group estimates the expected value of share-based payments and this is charged through the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant instrument.
The valuations are calculated using either the Black Scholes method or a Monte Carlo Simulation dependent upon whether the shares have an external performance criterion or not.
These valuations are based upon a number of assumptions which are detailed in Note 31 and amended only to take account of the estimated levels of share vesting and exercise.
Any changes in these assumptions over the period of vesting can affect the actual number of shares which may vest and may be exercised at the end of the vesting period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is material.
Key Estimations and Assumptions The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements.
The resulting accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results, which will only be known in time.
Those areas believed to be key areas of estimation are noted below, with further details of the assumptions used listed at the relevant note.
Item Note reference Impairment testing 14 Share based payments 31 3.
SEGMENT INFORMATION All of the Groups revenue and profits arose wholly from the processing and distribution of liquid milk and associated products in the UK.
Consequently, under IFRS 8, the directors have concluded that the Group has a single operating and reporting segment.

TAX Year ended 53 Weeks ended 3 April 2010 4 April 2009 000 000 Current tax: UK Corporation tax 13,388 10,110 Adjustment in respect of prior year tax computations 675 2,448 Total current tax 12,713 7,662 Deferred tax: Current year 687 1,048 Impact of withdrawal of IBAs 17,060 Adjustment in respect of prior year tax computations 45 512 Total deferred tax 732 16,524 Total tax 13,445 24,186 The prior years tax figures were significantly affected by the one-off impact arising from a change in legislation to phase out Industrial Buildings Allowances IBAs.
The deferred tax impact on the Group in the period of the withdrawal of IBAs was 17,060,000.
There was no immediate cash impact of this change.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: Year ended Year ended 53 Weeks ended 53 Weeks ended 3 April 3 April 4 April 4 April 2010 2010 2009 2009 000 % 000 % Profit before tax 49,207 30,767 UK corporation tax rate of 28% 2009: 28% 13,778 28.0% 8,614 28.0% Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 474 1.0% 735 2.4% Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses 94 0.2% 427 1.4% Adjustments to the tax charge in respect of previous periods 630 1.3% 1,936 6.3% Temporary differences 770 1.6% 676 2.2% Current year deferred tax 687 1.4% 536 1.7% Tax expense and effective tax rate for the year on ordinary items 13,445 27.3% 7,126 23.2% Adjustment to deferred tax in respect of withdrawal of IBAs 17,060 55.4% Tax expense and effective tax rate for the year 13,445 27.3% 24,186 78.6% In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, items totalling a credit of 1,883,000 2009: charge of 449,000 have been taken directly to equity.

Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC 69 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 13.
At 3 April 2010 the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 5,576,000 2009: 4,668,000.
Included in additions is 158,000 2009: 70,000 in respect of capitalisation of interest.
GOODWILL 2010 2009 Group 000 000 Cost At start and end of year 4,394 4,394 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying value of goodwill by CGU is as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Glasgow depot 2,138 2,138 Northampton depot 246 246 Pensilva depot 738 738 Okehampton depot 842 842 Other depots 430 430 Total 4,394 4,394 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The discount rate applied to future cash flows has remained at 8.4% in 2010.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC 70 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 14.
GOODWILL CONTINUED The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows based on a changing dynamic in the way in which consumers purchase milk.
This rate varies dependent on the market in which the customers operate.
The present value of the cash flows is then compared to the carrying value of the asset.
The fair value of goodwill is substantially in excess of book value in both 2009 and 2010.
The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would have caused an impairment write down to be recorded at the year end.
INVESTMENTS The Company has investments in a number of subsidiary undertakings.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Credit Risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Group has a large percentage of business and trade receivables concentrated in a small number of customers.
The credit risk associated with the Groups trade receivables balance is limited as the customers are either large corporations with high credit ratings or the Group has credit insurance in place to mitigate the risk of exposure.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Trade and Other Receivables Group Group Company Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 Trade receivables 72,104 57,130 Amounts due from subsidiaries 75,235 84,803 VAT 3,349 2,214 Other receivables 222 603 Prepayments and accrued income 912 1,180 Total 76,587 61,127 75,235 84,803 Trade Receivables Total trade receivables net of allowances held by the Group at 3 April 2010 amounted to 72,104,000 2009: 57,130,000.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 1.0 million 2009: 1.0 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and managements assessment of the current economic environment.
Provision is made for receivables which are over 60 days past due.
Trade receivables which are past due but less than 60 days past due are provided for on a specific invoice by invoice basis.
This is based on previous experience and factors relevant to the specific customer and invoice.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 30 days 2009: 25 days.
No interest has been charged on the receivables.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customers credit quality and the potential credit limit of each customer.
New customers are subdivided into two groups, cash sales customers and credit accounts.
Cash sales customers settle their accounts in cash on a daily or weekly basis.
The quantities involved are usually small with minimal credit exposure for the Group.
Credit checks are not generally carried out on these customers unless payment is to be made by cheque rather than cash.
For credit accounts all customers are credit checked using external credit agencies.
Credit ratings are used to allocate a credit rating to each new account or when applicable decline credit.
For any customer seeking a credit level above 100,000 an application is made to a credit insurance provider for an authorised credit limit and once approved this would allow credit clearance up to the level agreed with the insurer.
Credit limits are reviewed on a weekly basis with changes to insurance limits being notified to the Group on a daily basis.
Of the trade receivables balance of 72,104,000 2009: 57,130,000, 41,940,000 2009: 37,594,000 is due from Tesco, Sainsbury, Iceland, and the Co-operative Group including Somerfield 2009: Tesco, Sainsbury, Iceland, Arla Foods, the Co-operative Group and Somerfield, each of whom represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Within the Groups total trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 7,888,000 2009: 5,453,000 which are overdue for payment at the reporting date and which the Group has not made any provision for, on the basis that there has not been a change in the credit worthiness of the customer and the Group considers that the amounts will be recovered.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The weighted average age of these receivables past due is 45 days 2009: 45 days.

Despite this the credit risk associated with the Groups trade receivables is limited as the small numbers of customers previously mentioned are all large corporations with high credit ratings and or credit insurance in place to mitigate this exposure.
OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trade and Other Payables This principally comprises amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 40 days 2009: 38 days.

BORROWINGS Group Group 2010 2009 000 000 Bank loans and overdrafts 20,000 35,000 Obligations under finance leases 5,902 73 25,902 35,073 The borrowings are repayable as follows: On demand or within one year 1,223 73 In the second year 1,280 In the third to fifth years inclusive 23,399 35,000 24,679 35,000 25,902 35,073 There are nil borrowings in currencies other than Sterling 2009: Nil.
After taking into consideration the interest rate swaps in place in 2010, 25,902,000 of borrowings were arranged at fixed interest rates 2009: 20,073,000.
Other borrowings in the prior year were arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Directors estimate that the fair value of the Groups borrowings is not significantly different from the balance sheet values for all borrowings.
Liquidity Risk Management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors which has built appropriate processes and controls for monitoring and managing the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The main processes used by the Group to manage its liquidity risk are to maintain adequate reserves of cash, suitable banking facilities and available facilities.
The Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cashflows and as disclosed below the Group has suitable undrawn facilities to manage and further reduce the level of liquidity risk.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: i Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximates 4.50% 2009: 3.97% per annum.
ii The Group has one principal bank loan of 20.0 million 2009: 35.0 million.
This loan was advanced on 19 March 2009 and is due for repayment in full on 1 November 2011.
The loan carries an interest rate at 0.5% above LIBOR 2009: 0.5% above LIBOR per annum.
As at 3 April 2010, the Group had available 80.0 million 2009: 65.0 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities 20.0 million expires in one year or less 2009: 20.0 million.
The disclosures in respect of the ageing of trade receivables are provided in Note 18.
The trade payables balance is due to be paid within one month of the year end.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as detailed above, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 25 to 28.
Gearing Ratio Management review the level of debt and the capital structure of the Group on a regular basis.
Twice a year the Group reports on the level of gearing to its shareholders as part of the reporting process.
Managements view on the current level of debt is detailed in the Chairmans statement on page 2 and the Business and Financial Review on page 14.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Borrowings 25,902 35,073 Cash and cash equivalents 4,767 9,287 Net debt 21,135 25,786 Equity 139,627 134,521 Net debt to equity ratio 15.1% 19.2% Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Externally Imposed Capital Requirement The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest Rate Risk Management The Group is exposed to risk of fluctuations in interest rates as result of its level of borrowings in the current year and a significant amount of the borrowings have floating interest rates.
This risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate level of fixed and floating rates which it does with the use of interest rate swap contracts.
The Group shall continue to regularly evaluate its arrangements re interest rate swaps and hedging activities to ensure that these are aligned with the Group interest rate views and risk appetite.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section in Note 20.
Interest Rate Swaps The Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings during 2009 and 2010.
On 25 June 2008 the Group entered into an interest rate swap with Clydesdale Bank with an effective date of 25 June 2008, for a period of 5 years.
On 20 November 2007 the Group entered into an interest rate swap with an effective date of 22 November 2007, for a period of 3 years.
Under these contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
These contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of the variable rate debt held by the Group such as term loans, overdrafts etc.
The fair value of the interest rate swap at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract as disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based upon the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Outstanding receive fixed pay floating contracts % % 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swaps that are carried at fair value through the income statement 13 years 5.358% 5.358% 10,000 10,000 346 622 15 years 5.22% 5.22% 10,000 10,000 1,052 1,071 Total 1,398 1,693 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The Group shall settle the difference between the fixed swap rate and the notional LIBOR rate on a net basis.
This arrangement is designed to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into 3 levels based on the extent to which the fair value is observable.
The levels are classified as follows: Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identified financial assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair value is determined using directly observable inputs other than level 1 inputs.
Level 3: fair value is determined on inputs not based on observable market data.
In the current and prior year, the interest rate swaps are classed as level 2 financial instruments.
There have been no transfers between the various levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.
Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the Groups exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date.
In calculating the sensitivity management have assumed that for floating rate liabilities the amount of liability outstanding as at the balance sheet date is the same throughout the year.
When management have assessed interest rate risk they have assessed it based upon their best estimate of reasonably possible changes in interest rates which for the current year is 0.5%.
Had interest rates been 1.0% higher or lower whilst all other variables such as quantum of net debt were constant throughout the period, then the impact upon the Group profit for the 52 weeks ended 3 April 2010 would be 200,000 2009: 350,000.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period as there has been a fall in borrowings through the period as a result of a fall in the capital expenditure programme.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Equity-settled Share Option Plan The Group plan for share options, excluding the sharesave scheme, provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares over the three days prior to the date of grant.
The vesting period is generally three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options generally lapse if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The employee sharesave schemes are open to all employees and provide for a purchase price equal to the average market price on the three days prior to the date of invitation, less 20%.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 5.5 years from the date of grant, the options expire.

In the year ended 3 April 2010, options were granted on 23 June 2009, with the aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on that date being 522,000.
Share options have been granted under various employee schemes.
Under this scheme a maximum of 401,469 shares could be issued to participants in 2009 period from 5 April 2009 to 3 April 2010 310,620 shares in 2010, 484,696 in 2011 and 547,362 in 2012, upon the achievement of prescribed performance criteria.
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP conditional awards of shares can be made to selected employees, including the Executive Directors but excluding the Chief Executive.
This scheme is intended to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance of the Group and to more closely align their interests with those of the shareholders.
The performance criteria that must be met in order for the award to vest are detailed on pages 48 and 49 of the Directors Remuneration Report.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1,242,000 and 961,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions on share options in 2010 and 2009 respectively: 1,094,000 and 961,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions on share-based payments under the LTIP scheme in 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Other Share-based Payment Plans Share Incentive Plan In August 2002, the Group established an Inland Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan SIP which came into operation on 1 May 2003.
During the year ended 2 April 2005, two different forms of awards were made under the SIP, both of which were available to all employees of the Group with continuous service of 3 months.
Under the Matching Share scheme, participants could contribute up to 125 per month towards the purchase of shares in the Company which were then matched on a 1 for 4 basis.
In addition, and in order to celebrate the 10th anniversary in 2004 of the Companys flotation in 1994, each eligible employee was offered the chance to apply for a one off award under the SIP of 100 Free Shares in the Company.
Shares acquired under both the Matching Share scheme and the Free Share award are solely conditional upon the relevant participant remaining in the Groups employment for three years from the date of award.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Defined Contribution Schemes The Group operates a group personal pension scheme for its employees and a small defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension cost charged in respect of these schemes for the year ended 3 April 2010 was 1,646,000 2009: 1,997,000.
Contributions, including employee contributions, due but not yet paid in respect of the current reporting period amounted to 265,000 2009: 258,000.
Defined Benefit Schemes Following the acquisition of Aberdeen Milk Services Limited in May 1999, the Group assumed responsibility for the Aberdeen Milk Services Limited Pension Scheme.
In the prior year the Group sought to transfer the responsibility for the liability and on 23 October 2007 the pension scheme wind up was triggered.
The Trustees accepted a quote from Legal & General L&G on 30 November 2007 and locked into the assumptions used by L&G at that date.
Assets of 5,421,990 were received by L&G on 5 December 2007.
L&G assumed the mortality risk for the deferred pensioners from 30 November 2007 and for the pensioners from 1 November 2008.
The final settlement and consequent wind-up of the Scheme occurred during the current year.

CONTINGENT LIABILITY Office of Fair Trading OFT In December 2007 the Company entered into an Early Resolution Agreement with the OFT in relation to its investigation into Dairy Retail Prices under Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998 the Agreement.
The Company, and other parties, were subject to a provisional finding by the OFT in respect of the disclosure of commercially sensitive retail pricing intentions in respect of fresh liquid milk in 2003 the 2003 Retail Price Initiative.
The matters reviewed by the OFT related to Retail Price Initiatives which resulted in additional monies being returned to farmers.
The Companys support for the 2003 Retail Price Initiative was driven by a wish to provide support for its farmer suppliers.
All monies paid to the Company following the Retail Price Initiatives were returned to farmers and no profit was generated by the Company from such initiatives.
Further to entering into the Agreement the Company reached a settlement with the OFT in December 2007 to pay 6.1 million.
This settlement was revised downwards in April 2010 and as part of this revisal the Company has agreed to pay a sum of 4.2 million.
Further to those arrangements the OFT resolved its investigation in relation to Wiseman, on condition it continues to provide full co-operation to the OFT.
The sum of 4.2 million represents an imposed penalty of 6.5 million less a 35% discount for co-operation: the Company intends to continue to co-operate fully with the OFT and as such the Company considers that 4.2 million accurately reflects the amount of money that shall be paid, with the balance of 2.3 million representing a contingent liability.
