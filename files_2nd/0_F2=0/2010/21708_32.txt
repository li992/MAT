The Finance No 2 Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, includes legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
Please refer to note 19 for the impact that such changes would have had on these financial statements had they been enacted at the balance sheet date.

Taxation continued The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from amounts that would arise using the effective UK tax rate applicable to profits of the Group companies, as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Profit on ordinary activities before tax 49,670 17,545 Theoretical tax charge at UK rate of 28% 2009: 28% 13,908 4,913 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 646 71 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 208 210 Capital items in revenue 14 21 Share-based payments 426 1,004 Research and development tax credits 65 91 Adjustment in respect of previous period 44 705 Adjustment in respect of foreign tax rates 18 166 Other 110 86 Total tax expense 14,113 5,503 8.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders for the relevant period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence less the weighted average number of own shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with further adjustments to the weighted average number of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive ordinary shares.
There are no differences between the profit for each financial year attributable to equity holders used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
The reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is given below: 2010 2009 Total number Weighted average Total number Weighted average thousands thousands thousands thousands Number of shares at 01 July 2009 and 01 July 2008 193,768 193,768 192,966 192,966 Issue of shares 4,842 1,931 802 364 Number of shares at 30 June 2010 and 30 June 2009 198,610 195,699 193,768 193,330 Shares owned by employee trusts note 22 562 6,680 968 4,314 Shares held under Share Incentive plan 285 446 545 522 Shares held in nominee account under the Share award scheme note 20 iii 14,881 14,775 14,590 9,443 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 22 16,359 21,721 30,756 40,239 Basic number of shares 166,523 152,077 146,909 138,812 Shares owned by employee trusts note 22 562 6,680 968 4,314 Shares held by Share Incentive plan 285 446 545 522 Shares held in nominee account under the Share award scheme note 20 iii 14,881 14,775 14,590 9,443 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 22 16,359 21,721 30,756 40,239 Employee share options 38 2,727 4,879 4,752 Dilutive number of shares 198,648 198,426 198,647 198,082 Profit attributable to equity holders of the Group 000s 35,557 35,557 12,042 12,042 78 BlueBay Asset Management plc 9.

Financial risk management A qualitative analysis of the financial risks, which include credit, market and liquidity risks, facing the Group is provided in the Risk Management and Internal Control section to this Annual Report.
a Credit risk management Credit risk is the possibility that the Group may suffer a loss from the failure of one of our counterparties to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk in respect of amounts owed by related parties and segregated mandates and from cash deposits with banks.
Financial assets subject to credit risk are: 2010 2009 Note 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 16 90,050 62,270 Derivative financial instruments 15 1,439 303 Total excluding trade receivables 91,489 62,573 Amounts owed by related parties 14 18,703 21,119 Other trade receivables 14 11,996 5,144 Total trade receivables 30,699 26,263 Total 122,188 88,836 i Counterparty credit rating The counterparty rating of the Groups financial assets subject to counterparty risk and neither past due nor impaired was as follows: 30 June 2010 AAor better % Not rated % Cash and cash equivalents 99 1 Derivative financial instruments 100 Amounts owed by related parties 100 Other trade receivables 100 79 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 10.
Financial risk management continued 30 June 2009 AAor better % Not rated % Cash and cash equivalents 99 1 Derivative financial instruments 100 Amounts owed by related parties 100 Other trade receivables 100 ii Ageing and impairment of financial assets according to the contractual due date Amounts owed by related parties and other trade receivables relate to management and performance fees owed by funds and segregated mandates managed by the Group.
The ageing profile of amounts owed by these counterparties at the end of the period is as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Not older than 30 days 28,608 23,844 Older than 30 days not older than 60 days 328 1,206 Older than 60 days not older than 90 days 1,672 1,213 Older than 90 days but not older than 120 days Older than 120 days but not older than 180 days Older than 180 days 91 Total 30,699 26,263 Amounts not older than 30 days are neither past due nor impaired.
Amounts older than 30 days are past due but not impaired.
This represents 7% of the total fees outstanding 2009: 9%.
Factors considered in determining whether impairment has taken place include the deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty and knowledge of specific events that could influence a debtors ability to repay an amount due.
No impairments were recorded on items exposed to credit risk in either the current or comparative financial years.
The maximum credit exposure is equivalent to the carrying fair value of the balances shown.
iii Concentrations of credit risk The Groups largest counterparty exposure at the end of each period is as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s 1 AArated bank 88,951 61,467 1 Standard & Poors ratings The amount of these exposures can change significantly each month.
b Market risk management i Investments in funds Under the deferred compensation scheme, the Group awards units in a range of BlueBay investment funds to employees.
Awards made to employees are subject to forfeiture provisions.
Where units have been forfeited or acquired from employees note 13, they are held in one of the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts until the units are either subsequently realised or used for future awards to employees.
Units forfeited and or acquired from employees are recognised as current financial assets.
The Group calculates the market risk on these financial assets using a value at risk VaR methodology using a one month time horizon, at a 95% confidence interval.
VaR is an estimate of the worst loss due to movements in market rates over a target horizon with a given level of confidence.
Volatilities and correlations of market rates such as interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices are estimated from past observations and projected forward over the target horizon using a technique known as Monte Carlo simulation.
VaR is then measured as a quantile of the projected distribution of gains and losses.
The increase in the VaR in 2010 compared with 2009 reflects the increased investments in the funds.
80 BlueBay Asset Management plc 2010 VaR of Investments in the funds 30 June 2010 Average during the year Maximum during the year Minimum during the year 000s 000s 000s 000s 95 79 238 7 2009 VaR of Investments in the funds 30 June 2009 Average during the year Maximum during the year Minimum during the year 000s 000s 000s 000s 4 32 66 4 At 30 June 2010 a 100 basis point strengthening weakening of the US Dollar against sterling, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a fair value adjustment of 17,000 2009: 1,000, with a corresponding impact on the Income Statement.
At 30 June 2010 a 100 basis point strengthening weakening of the net asset valuation of the funds, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a fair value adjustment of 20,000 2009: 1,000, with a corresponding impact on the Income Statement.
ii Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in the following currencies: Year ended 30 June 2010: Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial assets Note 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 16 79,955 2,648 7,148 261 38 90,050 Current financial assets 13 323 1,730 2,053 Trade receivables 14 4,287 10,628 15,784 30,699 Derivative financial instruments 15 761 678 1,439 Total financial assets 84,565 15,767 23,610 261 38 124,241 Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Trade and other payables due within one year 2,109 6,166 12,549 14 673 21,511 Total financial liabilities 2,109 6,166 12,549 14 673 21,511 Year ended 30 June 2009: Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial assets Note 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 16 55,519 3,431 3,124 149 47 62,270 Current financial assets 13 122 122 Trade receivables 14 229 9,337 15,697 1,000 26,263 Derivative financial instruments 15 382 685 303 Total financial assets 55,748 12,508 19,506 149 1,047 88,958 81 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 10.
Financial risk management continued Japanese Sterling US Dollar Euro Yen Other Total Financial liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Trade and other payables due within one year 4,525 1,561 7,271 7 4 13,368 Total financial liabilities 4,525 1,561 7,271 7 4 13,368 Financial liabilities comprise current trade payables and accruals.
They do not include provisions which are explicitly excluded from the definition of a financial instrument under IFRS 7.
The Group estimates that, at 30 June 2010, if the foreign currency rates applicable to the Groups financial assets and liabilities strengthened weakened by 100 basis point against sterling, with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have decreased increased by 258,000 363,000 respectively, principally as a result of the decrease increase in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 2009: pre-tax profit will have increased in both circumstances by 17,000 and 22,000 respectively.
The Groups revenue is principally received in US Dollars and Euros.
From time to time, the Group may put in place short-term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge these future receivables.
At 30 June 2010 a 100 basis point strengthening weakening of the US Dollar and Euro against sterling, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an additional foreign exchange loss gain of 499,000 2009: 250,000, with a corresponding impact on the Income Statement.
Interest rate risk is the risk arising from unexpected or untoward movements in interest rates.
The Groups monetary assets earn interest at 20 basis points below the base rate.
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2010, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 802,000 higher 2009: 376,000 higher, mainly as a result of higher interest on average cash balances.
The interest rate received on the Groups bank deposits would only need to fall by 30 basis points to eliminate any interest income received during the current financial year, resulting in lower post-tax profit of 266,000 2009: 376,000 lower.
As the Group does not have any debt financing, it is therefore not significantly exposed to the risk of the extra cost associated with higher interest rates on debt borrowing.
c Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed circumstances.
i Financial assets and liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and are all due within one year.

They do not include provisions which are explicitly excluded from the definition of a financial instrument under IFRS 7. e Capital management The Group uses its capital to support the growth of the business, to provide it with a cushion to shield it from adverse market conditions and to ensure that it is at all times able to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
In accordance with the requirements of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, the potential adverse effects of specific individual and combinations of operational risks have been assessed.
In addition, using multi-year financial models, a number of potential adverse scenarios have been analysed in order to determine their effect on the Groups capital.
The Group has been in compliance with and maintained a comfortable excess over, the minimum regulatory capital requirements set by the Financial Services Authority at all times during the year.
Once these requirements have been met, available capital may be used to pay dividends to shareholders, to provide funding for the Groups equity incentivisation programme, to provide funding for new business initiatives and to provide seed capital for new funds.
The Groups Financial Resources are discussed in the Business Review on page 32.

Where units have been forfeited and or acquired from employees under the scheme, they are held in one of the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts until such units are either subsequently realised or used for future awards to employees.
Disposals relate to units which have been realised.
Of the total additions of 2,468,000, 2,148,000 relates to the acquisition of fund units from employees 2009: nil.
In connection with the restructuring of the Groups distressed debt fund fund, which completed in July 2009, the Group agreed to acquire any fund units due to be redeemed by employees apart from units redeemed to meet tax and national insurance liabilities in order to satisfy the Groups existing deferred incentive scheme vesting schedules and to help preserve liquidity for non-employee shareholders of the fund.
Financial assets held at fair value are designated as such upon initial recognition.
The fair values of the investments in funds are determined by using the net asset values of the funds at the Balance Sheet date.
During the year the Group adopted Amendments to IFRS 7, Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments which introduces a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement disclosure, as follows: Level 1.
Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value measurement of financial assets can be analysed as follows: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 30 June 2010 000s 000s 000s Total Financial assets held at fair value Investments in funds 323 1,730 2,053 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 30 June 2009 000s 000s 000s Total Financial assets held at fair value Investments in funds 122 122 Movement in Level 3 financial assets, measured at fair value, during the year can be analysed as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Level 3 Financial assets held at fair value: At 1 July 2009 and 2008 122 Gains losses included in profit for the year 131 11 Additions 2,148 133 Disposals 671 At 30 June 1,730 122 86 BlueBay Asset Management plc 14.

The provision for this onerous contract has been made taking into account residual lease commitments, other outgoings and sub-letting lease surrender arrangements.
In arriving at the provision, the cash flows have been discounted at rates representing an estimate of the interest rates relevant to the period of provision.
The weighted average of these rates is 2 per cent.
It is envisaged that the provision will be utilised on an even basis until 2015 in line with the remaining lease term.
The calculation of the onerous lease provision involves two principal assumptions: an estimation of the time value of money to the Group, and the mitigating effects of sub-letting income receivable.
Cash inflows and outflows are predominantly contractually agreed fixed amounts.
The effect on the provision of an increase decrease of 1 per cent.
In the discount rate used in the calculation would be 390,000 2009: 110,000 with a corresponding impact on the Income Statement.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of surplus space provisions to the methods and assumptions used in their estimation is therefore not considered to be significant.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using an effective tax rate of 28% 2009: 28%.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where the tax deduction in the current year has exceeded the current taxable profits.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on the probability that the Group will derive taxable profits in the future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
a Deferred tax assets The movement on the deferred tax asset account is as follows: Temporary differences 000s At 1 July 2009 7,672 Income Statement credit 2,159 Deferred tax asset utilised in current year originally taken against equity 4,418 Deferred tax on share-based payments taken to equity 3,911 Currency translation differences 8 At 30 June 2010 9,332 88 BlueBay Asset Management plc Temporary differences 000s At 1 July 2008 6,543 Income Statement credit 1,095 Deferred tax asset utilised in current year originally taken against equity 320 Deferred tax on share-based payments taken to equity 348 Currency translation differences 6 At 30 June 2009 7,672 The deferred tax credited to equity during the year is as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Share option scheme 2,341 23 Share award scheme 1,570 325 Total 3,911 348 An analysis of the deferred tax asset is as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Accelerated depreciation for tax purposes 351 230 Share-based payments 6,355 4,923 Deferred compensation scheme 2,547 2,516 Other 79 3 Total deferred tax asset 9,332 7,672 b Deferred tax liability The movement on the deferred tax liability account is as follows: Temporary differences 000s At 1 July 2009 228 Income Statement charge 157 At 30 June 2010 385 Temporary differences 000s At 1 July 2008 Income Statement charge 228 At 30 June 2009 228 An analysis of the deferred tax liability is as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Derivative financial instruments 385 228 89 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 19.
Deferred tax continued As mentioned in note 7, changes to the UK main rate of corporation tax, as announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement, were substantively enacted on 20 July 2010.
The effect of the changes enacted in the Finance No 2 Act 2010 would be to reduce the deferred tax asset provided at 30 June 2010 by 276,000.
This 276,000 decrease in the deferred tax asset would decrease profit for the year by 94,000 and decrease deferred tax on share-based payments taken to equity by 182,000.
This decrease in the deferred tax asset is due to the proposed stepped reduction of the main rate of corporation tax rate from 28% to 24% by 1 April 2014: with a 1% stepped reduction enacted each year with effect from 1 April 2011.
The effect of the changes enacted in the Finance No 2 Act 2010 on the deferred tax liability would be to reduce the deferred tax liability provided at 30 June 2010 by 3,000.
This 3,000 decrease in the deferred tax liability would have a corresponding increase on the profit for the year.
Share-based payments The Group seeks to facilitate significant equity ownership by management and employees, principally through various equity settled, share-based compensation schemes.
Details of these schemes can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 57 to these Financial Statements and are summarised in the notes below.
The fair value of the employee services rendered in exchange for the share awards and options granted previously under these schemes is recognised as an expense through the Income Statement.
The expense is based on the fair value of the share-based payment transactions on grant date, spread over the vesting period.
During the year, the following expense was charged to the Group Income Statement in respect of equity settled, share-based transactions: 2010 2009 000s 000s EMI Scheme i Unapproved option award scheme ii 31 76 Share award scheme iii 11,197 9,920 SIP Scheme iv 298 279 Total 11,526 10,275 For the year ended 30 June 2009, 1,070,000 of the total share award scheme charges of 9,920,000 are shown within exceptional items in the Group Income Statement as they relate to accelerated charges with respect to good leavers note 3.
There are no comparable amounts for the year ended 30 June 2010. i Enterprise Management Incentive EMI Option Award Scheme The Group issued share options through its EMI scheme in December 2005.
A total of 20,700,000 options under this scheme were exercised when the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange on 22 November 2006.
As a condition of exercise, the Company required the holders of the EMI options to enter into an agreement not to sell their resulting shares for a period of up to four years following Listing although 25% of these Ordinary shares became available for sale on each anniversary of the date of exercise of the EMI options.
As at 30 June 2010, selling restrictions on 75% of the shares held by employees had been lifted.
The scheme is no longer operative and there are no options outstanding under this scheme.
During the year, the movement in respect of restricted ordinary shares issued under the scheme was as follows: 2010 2009 Note Number of shares Number of shares Balance at 1 July 9,087,500 15,387,500 Shares sold on open market 274,016 Shares vested unconditionally 4,543,750 5,075,000 Shares forfeited to Group Employee Benefit Trust 22 950,984 Restricted shares unsold at 30 June 4,543,750 9,087,500 ii Unapproved Option Award Scheme The Group operated a second option award scheme, not approved by HMRC, where selected employees were eligible to participate.
All grants under this scheme were made in 2006, prior to Listing and there have been no new awards during the year.
In general terms, providing an option holder remains an employee of the Group, options may be exercised in accordance with a vesting schedule as follows: 25% on or after each of 30 January 2007, 30 January 2008, 30 January 2009 and 30 January 2010.
All Unapproved options expire on the business date preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Shares awarded during the current and previous financial year vest unconditionally with employees over a period of three to five years after the grant date with either 25% of the shares vesting on each anniversary of the date of award, commencing two years after the grant date or 100% of the shares vesting on the third anniversary after the grant date.
Shares are held in a nominee account on behalf of each employee until such shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
In respect of good leavers, shares continue to follow the original vesting schedule although forfeiture provisions are lifted so that such shares are no longer restricted.
The fair value of the shares is measured on the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares.
The fair value of the shares granted is taken to be the market price at the date of award.
The amount recognised in the Income Statement is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual number of shares that vest.

The scheme is open to UK based employees and provides free shares from the Group to each participating employee, based on an award of 3,000 worth of shares per employee.
The Group also provides free shares that match the employee purchase up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum in the ratio of two to one.
The Group purchases shares on the open market in order to satisfy such share awards.
The Group did not make awards under its SIP scheme during the current or previous financial year.
The share-based payment charges being expensed in the current and previous financial years relates to awards made prior to 1 July 2008.
The fair value of shares awarded under the SIP scheme is measured on the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares.
