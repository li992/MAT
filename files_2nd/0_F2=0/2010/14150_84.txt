Governance Remuneration Report continued Share Option Schemes The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by employees encourages the matching of long term interests between employees and shareholders.
All UK employees including Executive Directors may participate in a HMRC approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS.
Former Executive Directors and senior employees were also able to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
However, grants of options under the ESOS were discontinued in August 2005 when this scheme was replaced by the LTiP.
Neither of the current Executive Directors hold awards under the ESOS.
During the year and pursuant to the 2009 Rights issue a standard HMRC formula was used to make fair adjustment to the number of subsisting options under the SRSOS and ESOS.
An amendment was also made to the rules of both schemes, to remove an outdated provision to obtain an additional fair and reasonable opinion from the auditors with regard to the above mentioned adjustment.
Under the terms of the SRSOS options may be granted during the ten year period to July 2015 to acquire up to 10% of the issued equity share capital of the Company, including options granted under the ESOS and LTiP.
Options are granted at the higher of the nominal value of an ordinary 10p share and an amount determined by the Remuneration Committee being not less than 80% of the market value.
Employees held options over nearly 1.3 million shares under the SRSOS as at 31 March 2010.
Directors Service Contracts and Notice Periods The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the policy with regard to the notice period for Executive Directors is one year.
Accordingly, Mr T Drury has a rolling service contract dated 3 September 2007 which requires one years notice from the Company.
The service contract of Mr C Surch dated 27 April 2009 has the same provisions save that until 1 November 2009 a mutual six month notice period applied.
in the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee considers what compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances of the particular case.
As reported last year Mr F welham stepped down from the Board as Group Finance Director on 27 April 2009.
He left the Company on 31 May 2009 and subsequently received a termination payment of 43,175 inclusive of payments in lieu of pension and life assurance entitlements.
No bonus payment was made in addition to that already earned for the 2008 09 financial year as disclosed in last years Remuneration Report.
Though also contractually entitled to twelve months salary in lieu of notice, the Committee phased payments monthly and mitigated these costs by the net income earned by Mr F welham from alternative employment, resulting in a phased payment of 158,452, thereby mitigating the contractual entitlement by circa 40%.
Outstanding ESOS and SAYE options, in accordance with scheme rules, remained exercisable for six months but were not exercised and have now lapsed as have both his 2007 and 2008 LTiP awards.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts as their terms of engagement are governed by letters of appointment.
During the year, letters of appointment for both Mr E van Amerongen and Dr S Riley were renewed for a further three year term.
Unexpired term Date of original Date of current at date of this appointment re-appointment Expiry date report A Auer 16 May 2005 16 May 2008 16 May 2011 12 months P Johnson 16 May 2005 16 May 2008 16 May 2011 12 months E van Amerongen 9 Feb 2007 9 Feb 2010 9 Feb 2013 32 months S Riley 29 March 2007 29 March 2010 29 March 2013 34 months with effect from 1 April 2010 the Board determined to increase the fees of Mr P Johnson and Dr S Riley by circa 5% to 42,000 per annum and 37,000 per annum respectively in recognition of the additional time requirement of Nonexecutives and their continuing independent contribution, their fees not having been reviewed by the Board since 2007.
External Appointments The Remuneration Committee acknowledges that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other quoted companies which have no business relationship with the Group and that these duties can broaden their experience and knowledge to the benefit of the Company.
Executive Directors are limited to holding one such position and the policy is that fees may be retained by the Director, reflecting the personal risk assumed in such appointments.
No external appointments were held by the Executive Directors during the year.
