EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major scheme, which covers the UK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type.
In 2007, this scheme, along with the Irish defined benefit scheme, ceased any future accrual for current members and both were closed to new members.
UK and Irish employees are now covered by defined contribution schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme was carried out at September 2006 and updated to 30th June 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the UK and Irish schemes were: 30th June 2010 30th June 2009 30th June 2008 UK scheme Irish scheme UK scheme Irish scheme UK scheme Irish scheme Rate of increase in pension payments 3.3% 2.4% 3.3% 2.5% 3.8% 2.7% Discount rate 5.3% 4.4% 6.2% 5.5% 6.2% 6.5% Inflation rate 3.4% 2.4% 3.4% 2.5% 4.1% 2.7% Expected return on equities 8.1% 7.1% 8.3% 7.4% 9.1% 8.2% Retirement age 64 65 64 65 64 65 The mortality assumption used for 2010 is PCA00, year of birth, medium cohort 2009 short cohort, which reflects increasing life expectancy.
For the Irish defined benefit scheme, being the other scheme included here, the market value of assets at the end of the year was 4,780,000 2009 4,177,000 and the actuarial value of liabilities was 8,866,000 2009 7,434,000.
The expected rates of return are based on market conditions at 30th June 2010 and represent the best estimate of future returns, allowing for risk premiums where appropriate.
