The City of London Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23 VAT on management fees Following the 2007 decision by the European Court of Justice that Value Added Tax VAT should not be charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies, over the previous two financial years the Company received in total 2,589,000 in VAT reclaims relating to management fees paid during the periods 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996 and 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007, 948,000 of which was recognised in the financial statements to 30 June 2009.
The reclaim was allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
In addition, the Company received 828,000 of simple interest on those VAT reclaims, which was included in the financial statements to 30 June 2009.
No further reclaims of VAT or interest were received or expected during the year under review.

As the current likelihood of success is very uncertain, there is no recognition of any potential reclaims in these financial statements.
VAT has not been applied to investment management and performance fees invoiced since June 2007.
