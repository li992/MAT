Our investment in TNK-BP was reclassified from a jointly controlled entity to an associate with effect from 9 January 2009, the date that BP finalized a revised shareholder agreement with its Russian partners in TNK-BP, Alfa Access-Renova AAR.
The formerly evenly-balanced main board structure was replaced by one with four representatives each from BP and AAR, plus three independent directors.
The change in accounting classification from a jointly controlled entity to an associate reflected the ability of the independent directors of TNK-BP to decide on certain matters in the event of disagreement between the shareholder representatives on the board.
The groups investment continues to be accounted for using the equity method.
Transactions between the group and its jointly controlled entities are summarized below.
