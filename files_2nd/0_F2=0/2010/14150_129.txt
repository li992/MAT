The Group also has two other small funded defined benefit schemes, which are included in the defined benefit disclosures below.
Pension costs for the defined benefit section are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
Assumptions The most recent actuarial valuation of the principal funded defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group dated 5 April 2009 has been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2010.
The main assumptions were as follows: 2010 2009 % p. a.
Discount rate 5.6 6.6 Future salary growth 4.6 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions payment fixed 3% 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 5% 3.4 2.9 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 2.5% 2.2 2.1 Rate of price inflation 3.6 3.0 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2025 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for around a further 24 years after retirement if they are male or for a further 26 years after retirement if they are female.
The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each asset class is set out above.
The overall expected rate of return is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the schemes as at 31 March 2010.
At 31 March 2010 the IAS 19 net retirement deficit was 6.8m 2009: 1.0m.
The amount of the deficit varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased or decreased by 0.25%, the IAS19 asset would increase or decrease by circa 5.0m.
