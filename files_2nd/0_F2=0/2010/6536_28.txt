Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 77 The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2006 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 6.0% per annum before retirement and 3.6% per annum after retirement, that pay increases would average 4.0% per annum and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 2.8% per annum.
The market value of the assets of the fund at 31 March 2006, excluding additional voluntary contributions is 55.0m.
Following the disposal of several businesses, the Directors and the Trustees made an agreement in 2000 on the future operation of the fund.
This agreement apportioned part of the fund surplus for use of the Trustees for augmenting members benefits.
After offsetting the element of surplus under the control of the Trustees, the market value of the remaining available assets at 31 March 2006 was 18.7m.
The value of those assets represents approximately 94% of the value of the residual uninsured liabilities which were 19.9m at 31 March 2006, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The Groups pension cost for the scheme in 2010 is 0.2m 2009: 0.3m.
Other defined benefit scheme in deficit: The Group also operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig Development Company Limited.
The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2010 under the provisions of IAS 19 were 3.3m 2009: 2.8m, 2008: 3.0m and 4.6m 2009: 4.1m, respectively.
Other unfunded schemes On the acquisition of Sygen International plc, the Group acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous groups senior employees and executives.
For the three unfunded defined benefit schemes, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19 the scheme liabilities amount to 5.7m 2009: 5.0m, 2008: 4.5m and this amount is included within pension liabilities in the Groups balance sheet.
The current cost charged to operating profit in the year to 30 June 2010 amounted to nil 2009: nil, 2008: nil and the interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to 0.3m 2009: 0.3m, 2008: 0.3m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 5.5% 2009: 6.0%, 2008: 6.5%, that pay increases would average 0% per annum 2009: 0%, 2008: 0% and that inflation and pension payments would be 3.1% per annum 2009: 3.2%, 2008: 4.0%.
For the unfunded retirement health benefit plan, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19, scheme liabilities amount to 1.4m 2009: 1.3m, 2008: 1.3m and this amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Groups balance sheet.
The current cost charged to operating profit in the year to 30 June 2010 amounted to nil 2009: nil and the interest on plan liabilities amounted to 0.1m 2009: 0.1m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 5.5% 2009: 6.0% and that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 7.1% 2009: 7.4%.

The mortality tables used are the SN1A tables, with birth year and medium cohort projections, with mortality rates increased by 25% at all ages 2009 and 2008: PxA00 tables, with birth year and medium cohort projections, with mortality rates increased by 25% at all ages.
The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years time.
The expected long-term rate of return is based on the portfolio as a whole and not on the sum of the returns on individual asset categories.
The return is based exclusively on historical returns, without adjustments.
The amount the deficit varies if the main financial assumption changes, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 deficit would decrease increase by 2.5m.
