The return on equities is 3.5% per annum in excess of the yield on government bonds.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation at 31 March 2010.
The actual return on plan assets is as follows: Consolidated Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Actual return on plan assets 494.8 276.9 250.3 125.3 history of experience gains and losses Consolidated Company 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 m m m m m m m m m m Total actuarial losses and gains recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income before adjustment for taxation 383.0 359.0 185.0 47.4 14.1 161.6 188.4 146.3 17.6 29.0 Experience losses gains on scheme liabilities 59.8 0.8 50.6 7.7 138.1 49.7 Experience gains losses on scheme assets 394.1 412.2 153.4 27.8 11.5 200.4 190.0 31.2 9.7 134.8 The cumulative actuarial gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income before adjustment for taxation since the adoption of IAS 19 is 957.8m losses 2009 318.5m.
