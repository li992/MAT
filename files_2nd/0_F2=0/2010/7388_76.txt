The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The value in use calculations are based on the budget for the following year, grown at 2%5% in perpetuity.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and short-term growth forecast in budgets.
Management estimates discount rates using WACC rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The discount rates used varied between 9% and 15% based on the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The short-term growth rates range from no growth to 124% of growth.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Whilst there is some uncertainty regarding the short-term impact of the political events in MENA, the Group doesnt consider that the likelihood of impairment losses in the long-term is increased.
