29 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Group comprises of an investment trust and a wholly owned subsidiary.
The Group invests in equities and other financial instruments for the long-term to further the investment objective set out on page 31.
This exposes the Group to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Group.
The main risks arising from the Groups pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the accounts relate.
The Groups exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and xed interest securities which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Groups operations.
Derivative transactions which the Group enters into may include equity or index options, index future contracts, and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks and foreign exchange risks arising from the Groups investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identied is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate the risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 29 a i, currency risk see note 29 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 29 a iii.
i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on its valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Group faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 22 to 28.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies as stated in Note 2 g. The Group had no derivative instruments at the year-end, but, in the event that it had, the value of derivative instruments held at the balance sheet date would be determined by reference to their fair value at that date.

The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Market price risks exposure The Groups exposure to changes in market prices at 30 April on its quoted and unquoted equity investments was as follows: 30 April 2010 30 April 2009 000 000 Non-current asset investments at fair value through profit or loss 386,031 267,845 386,031 267,845 An analysis of the Groups portfolio is shown on pages 22 to 28.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% 30 April 2009: 15% in the fair values of the Groups equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.

iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may affect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Group nances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Group uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both xed and oating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate prole and manage the exposure to interest rate uctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
