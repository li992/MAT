The Groups policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Groups cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 3M% to 7M% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
This policy remains suspended following a Board decision in December 2MM4 given the absence of floating rate bank debt.
at 31 December 2M1M 88% 2MM9: 86% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
as at 31 December 2M1M 284 million 2MM9: 2M4 million was in bank deposits of which 267 million 2MM9: 186 million was on deposit with banks in the UK.
a 1MM basis point increase in interest rates on deposits would result in a 2.8 million reduction in net interest expense.
This sensitivity flexes the interest rate of variable deposits assuming deposits as at 31 December 2M1M remain in place for 12 months.
c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts.
Operational as tier-one suppliers to automotive, land systems and aerospace original equipment manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Groups results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In Land Systems there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
at a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
at a divisional level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly.
provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customers ability to pay and other factors in the Groups relationship with the customer.
at 31 December the largest 5 trade receivables as a proportion of total trade receivables analysed by major segment is as follows: 2010 2MM9 restated % % Driveline 50 51 powder Metallurgy 17 2M aerospace 66 64 Land Systems 25 28 The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 761 million 2MM9: 642 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long term credit rating, normally at least aaor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 56 million 2MM9: 61 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2M1M to a single bank was 1 million 2MM9: nil.
The amounts on deposit at year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to financial credit risk with Group indebtedness varying over the course of a year in line with normal financing and trading patterns.
