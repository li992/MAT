Fair value and other reserves include amounts of 64.8m, 1.5m and 3.2 m in relation to a special reserve, a capital redemption reserve and an interest rate hedge reserve respectively.
The special reserve arose from the reduction in share capital in 1995, the capital redemption reserve arose in previous years on the repurchase of 2.9 million of the Companys own shares and the interest rate hedge arose on our fixed interest rate.
The purpose of these reserves is to maintain the Companys capital.
