In addition, for 2010, operating profit excludes costs associated with the terminated AIA transaction and the gain arising upon the dilution of the Groups holding in PruHealth.
For 2009, operating profit excluded the non-recurrent cost of hedging the Group IGD capital surplus included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the profit on sale and results of the sold Taiwan agency business.
The amounts for these items are included in total EEV profit attributable to shareholders.
The Company believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
Profit before tax and basic earnings per share include these items together with actual investment returns.
This basis of presentation has been adopted consistently throughout this supplementary information.
ii The value of future profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered businesses are included in the profits for new business and the in-force value of the Groups long-term business.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the profits from management of internal and external funds.
For EEV basis reporting, Group shareholders other income is adjusted to deduct the expected margins for the period on management of covered business.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of covered business.
iii Restructuring costs comprise the charge of 26 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 2 million recognised on the EEV basis for the shareholders share of restructuring costs incurred by the PAC with-profits fund 2009: 23 million on an IFRS basis and an additional 4 million on the EEV basis.
For 2010, Solvency II implementation costs comprise the charge of 45 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 1 million recognised on the EEV basis.
iv New business profits for the Groups Japanese insurance subsidiary, which ceased selling new business with effect from 15 February 2010, have been presented separately from those of the remainder of the Group.
v Exchange translation The comparative results have been prepared using previously reported average exchange rates for the year.
