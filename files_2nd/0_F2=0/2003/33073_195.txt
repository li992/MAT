29 Equity-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2003, the Group had a number of equity-based compensation plans: i All-Employee Option Plans Local All-Employee Option Plans have been set up in 16 countries to enhance employee involvement with Unilever and its performance by providing a potential financial benefit linked to the Unilever share price.
There are no individual performance targets to be met.
The plans permit participation by all permanent employees in the country where the relevant plan applies.
ii Executive Option Plans The Executive Option Plans were introduced in 1985 to reward key employees throughout the world for their contribution to the enhancement of the Groups longer-term future and their commitment to the Group over a sustained period.
The grant is dependent on performance of the Group and the individual.
iii The Share Matching Plans If managers invest part of their annual bonus in Unilever shares, the company will match this with the same number of shares on the condition that they keep all shares for an agreed number of years and will still be employed by Unilever on the vesting date.
iv The TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and, depending on the TSR ranking see page 20 of Unilever in comparison with its peer group, it will potentially award top executives on the vesting date three years later with between 0% and 200% of the original conditional award.
v The Restricted Share Plan Restricted shares are awarded to a select number of executives for special performance.
After the agreed number of years the awards will vest provided the executives are still employed by Unilever at that time.
vi The North American Performance Share Plan A long-term incentive plan for North American managers, awarding Unilever shares if company and personal performance targets are met over a three-year period.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of Executive Option Plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all Plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
In recent years we have met the obligations under our share option and award plans by purchasing shares in advance and transferring them, in return for the exercise price, to Directors and employees as the options are exercised.
116 Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2003 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 29 Equity-based compensation plans continued From 1 January 2003, for US GAAP purposes, Unilever has adopted SFAS 123.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model usually an adjusted Black-Scholes or multinomial model and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
Variable plans, being those with performance criteria other than a service period, are also accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123.
The actual remuneration cost charged in each period is shown below.
Amounts for prior years have been restated to reect compensation costs for all the employee awards granted or modied in scal years beginning after 1994. million million million 2003 2002 2001 Restated Restated All-Employee Option Plans 19 22 25 Executive Option Plans 101 88 56 Share Matching Plans 18 12 2 TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan 8 42 Restricted Share Plan 3 66 North American Performance Share Plan 59 53 15 208 185 106 The change in accounting policy has reduced operating profit in 2003 by 116 million 2002: 99 million: 2001: 60 million.

The disclosures required by SFAS 123, including a description of the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of options and the weighted average information, are given below for each type of plan, on a combined basis.
i All-Employee Option Plans Unilever has All-Employee Plans in 16 countries, which can be grouped together as follows: a Plans which follow a standard framework: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
b Other plans: North America, South Africa and United Kingdom.
Group a : The standard framework for these countries means, in principle, an annual grant of options over NV shares Ireland: NV or PLC shares, at the same grant date, exercise price the market price on the grant date and grant size including part-time employees pro rata and with the same eligibility criteria all permanent employees in a country.
There are no vesting conditions other than being continuously employed by a Group company until the vesting date.
Group b : The UK and South Africa plans annually offer options over PLC shares, combined with a compulsory UK or optional South Africa savings plan.
The exercise price is the market price at date of grant.
In 2003, Unilever UK introduced ShareBuy, an All-Employee Share Incentive Plan.
It is currently only being used as a tax efficient savings plan for employees, for which Unilever neither gives nor receives value.
Accordingly, no gures for this plan are included in this note.
The North American plan is a share purchase offering, with a compulsory savings plan, under which up to 10% of the salary of eligible employees is withheld.
At the end of the period employees can use the savings to buy NV New York shares at a discount.
The maximum number of shares made available under the plan is 8.9 million.
Until 2001 the plan had an offering period of two years, thereafter one year.
