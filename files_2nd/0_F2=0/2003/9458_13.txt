Statement of accounting policies The following are the principal accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding period, with the exception of the groups accounting policy for turnover see below.
Change in accounting policy The groups policy for recognising turnover was changed during the year following the adoption of Application Note G of FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions.
Under the groups new policy, where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of turnover recognised is the present value of the cash inflows expected to be received from the customer in settlement.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance income.
This represents a change to the previous policy under which turnover was recognised on an undiscounted basis.
The comparative figures in the primary statements and notes have been restated to reflect the new policy.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements include those of LogicaCMG plc the company and all its subsidiary undertakings together the group drawn up to 31 December 2003.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
In the prior period, the merger of Logica plc and CMG plc was accounted for using the merger accounting method.
In the groups financial statements, investments in joint ventures have been accounted for using the equity method as the separate assets and liabilities are not material to the group.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the groups shares of joint ventures results, while the groups share of the net assets of joint ventures is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life.
The useful economic lives do not exceed 20 years and are the periods over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying businesses are expected to exceed the value of the underlying net assets in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 remains written off to the profit and loss account reserve as permitted by FRS 10.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided at rates to write off the cost of the fixed assets down to their residual value over their expected useful lives on a straight-line basis at the following rates: Furniture 10-20% Computer rooms 20% Partitions and office equipment 10-20% Computers 25-33% Freehold property 2% Motor vehicles 25% Leasehold equipment and plant Over life of lease Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less any write down for impairment.
Stocks Stocks represent computer equipment that, at the balance sheet date, had not yet been allocated to a specific customer contract.
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets have passed to the group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet at the present value of minimum lease payments payable during the lease term and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Financial statements 55 LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Statement of accounting policies continued Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the rate of exchange under the related forward exchange contract.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates prevailing at that date or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Trading results of foreign subsidiaries are included in the groups results using average exchange rates.
Gains and losses arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment in foreign subsidiaries and the results of foreign subsidiaries at the year-end rate are taken directly to reserves.
Gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the groups investments in such operations, are also taken directly to reserves.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in the profit and loss account.
The most important foreign currency for the group is the euro.
The relevant exchange rates for translation to pounds sterling were: 12 months ended 31 December 2003 6 months ended 31 December 2002 Average Closing Average Closing 1.45 1.42 1.57 1.53 1 The primary reporting currency of the group is pounds sterling.
The group also presents primary statements in euros, see pages 74 to 76.
Hedge accounting The group uses forward contracts and currency options to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks.
The group considers these financial instruments to be hedges that is, an offset of foreign exchange risk when the following criteria are met: the financial instruments must be related to a specific foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified it must involve the same currency as the hedged item it must reduce foreign currency risk on the groups operations.
Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are included in the carrying amount of those assets or liabilities and are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Gains and losses on qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are classified as deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account or as adjustments in the carrying amount of the transaction when it occurs.
Forward contracts used to hedge the currency mix of the group have their contracted rates valued against the balance sheet rates with the net unrealised gains or losses being shown as part of the debt they are hedging.
The difference between the spot and forward rates for these contracts is recognised as net interest payable over the period of the contract.
The groups policy for financial instruments is given in note 24.
Gains or losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised as other income or expenses.
Research and development Research and development costs are written off in the period in which they are incurred unless they are to be reimbursed by third parties.
Turnover Turnover represents the fair value of work done for clients including attributable profit and after adjusting for all foreseeable future losses but excluding local sales taxes.
Revenue in respect of software product licences with no significant service obligation is recognised 100% on delivery.
For other software product licences, revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis based on the fair value of work performed.
Where the time value of money is material, turnover is recognised as the present value of the cash inflows expected to be received from the customer in settlement.
Recognition of profits Profit on contracts for the supply of professional services at predetermined rates is recognised as and when the work is performed, irrespective of the duration of the contract.
Profit is taken on fixed price contracts while the contract is in progress, having regard to the proportion of the total contract which has been completed at the balance sheet date and estimated costs by reference to the costs incurred to date versus total estimated costs to completion.
Provision is made for all foreseeable future losses.
Amounts recoverable on contracts Amounts recoverable on contracts represent turnover which has not yet been invoiced to clients on fixed price contracts.
Such amounts are separately disclosed within debtors.
The valuation of amounts recoverable on contracts is adjusted to take up profit to date or foreseeable losses in accordance with the accounting policy for the recognition of profits.
Financial statements 56 LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Statement of accounting policies continued Other amounts recoverable on contracts are valued at the lower of cost or estimated realisable value.
Cost comprises: professional amounts recoverable valued at the cost of salaries and associated payroll expenses of employees engaged on assignments and a proportion of attributable overheads unbilled expenses incurred and equipment purchased for clients in connection with specific contracts.
Post-retirement benefits The cost of the groups defined contribution arrangements are charged against profits on the basis of the contributions payable by the group.
The costs of the groups defined benefit pension arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs on a systematic basis allowing for the expected pension costs spread over the remaining service lives of the scheme members, as calculated by the actuaries of the group.
The cost of providing non-pension post-retirement benefits is charged to the profit and loss account to spread the regular cost over the service lives of employees.
The group has continued to disclose the amounts relating to the groups defined benefit pension schemes as required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Employee share ownership trusts The net result of the employee trusts, including profits or losses on sales of shares and tax thereon, is included in the financial statements.
Shares owned by the employee trusts are included in the balance sheet at average cost less any write down for permanent diminution in value.
Other assets and liabilities held by employee trusts are shown under the appropriate statutory heading.
Any difference between the exercise price and the market value at the date of grant of share options is charged through the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period to which the performance criteria relates.
Government grants Capital grants are treated as deferred income and credited to the profit and loss account on the same basis as the related assets are depreciated.
Revenue grants are credited to the profit and loss account in the same period as the related expenditure is charged.

Fees for further assurance services of 0.6 million in the six months ended 31 December 2002 payable to Deloitte & Touche related to due diligence services.
Exceptional items A charge of 107.2 million six months ended 31 December 2002: 4.2 million was incurred in the year ended 31 December 2003 relating to the restructuring programme put in place following the merger on 30 December 2002 of Logica plc and CMG plc.
The programme is now complete across the group.
The costs mainly related to redundancies and the cost of vacating properties.
In the six months ended 31 December 2002, a charge of 3.5 million was also made for the restructuring of CMGs Noord Nederland operation.
In the prior period, 22.6 million of merger transaction costs were incurred which were directly attributable to the merger of Logica plc and CMG plc.
In the prior period, the carrying values of the groups goodwill balances were compared to their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the group.
The value in use was derived from discounted cash flow projections which covered the five years from 1 January 2003.
After this five-year period, the projections used a long-term growth rate compatible with projections for the countries concerned.
The discount rate used to arrive at this calculation was 14% on a pre-tax basis.
The impairment review resulted a charge of 444.6 million for the six months ended 31 December 2002 in respect of various acquisitions made by the group in the past, principally Admiral and pdv.
A loss of 1.5 million on disposal of two businesses, Radio Planning and i2dm, was recognised during the year see note 23.

In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge for defined contribution schemes amounted to 34.6 million for the 12 months ended 31 December 2003 six months ended 31 December 2002: 15.7 million.
In addition, the group also operates several defined benefit pension schemes for the benefit of employees primarily in the UK and the Netherlands.
Each defined benefit scheme is funded in advance by contributions from the employing companies to meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme in regular funding reviews.
The schemes assets are held in funds separate from those of the group.
The CMG schemes were closed to new members in 1994.
The Admiral scheme was closed to new members in November 2000.
The CMG UK and Admiral UK schemes merged with effect from 1 July 2002.
The combined scheme is referred to as the CMG UK pension scheme.
The Logica Netherlands scheme was closed to new entrants and for future accrual in November 1999.
Consequently no contributions were made during the 12 months ended 31 December 2003.
The group contributes to a life policy scheme in the US for 12 ex-employees.
This scheme is closed to new members.
The assets of the scheme, valued at 3.8 million at 30 June 2002, are held by an insurance company for LogicaCMG Inc.
The total amount payable for death benefits is 2.7 million at 30 June 2002.
Valuation of significant defined benefit schemes The cost of the CMG UK pension scheme was assessed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method of valuation.
The date of the latest formal valuation was 1 July 2002.
The principal assumptions used were a rate of investment return of 7.5% per annum, salary increases during service of 4.0% per annum and a rate of inflation of 2.5%.
The market value of the schemes assets at the valuation date was 81.7 million and the funding level was 76.3% on an ongoing basis.
The deficit on the scheme will be met by increased rates of contribution by the group over the expected average remaining service lives of employees.
The scheme was 101.1% funded on a current funding level basis.
The cost of the CMG scheme in the Netherlands was assessed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method of valuation.
The date of the latest formal valuation was 1 January 2002.
The principal assumptions used were a rate of investment return of 6.0% per annum and salary increases during service of 4.0% per annum.
The market value of the schemes assets at the valuation date was 93.8 million.
This represented 152% of the actuarial value of accrued liabilities.
The surplus is being amortised over the remaining service lives of employees and is allowed for in the pension cost.
The pension prepayment of 4.4 million at 31 December 2003 31 December 2002: 0.2 million represents the cumulative difference between the pension cost charged to the profit and loss account each period for defined benefit schemes and pension contributions paid by group companies to defined benefit schemes.
At 31 December 2003, the pension prepayment related entirely to the Eurozone schemes.
At 31 December 2002, the pension prepayment of 0.2 million comprised a prepayment of 2.0 million in the Eurozone schemes and a 1.8 million liability in the UK schemes.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account for the 12 months ended 31 December 2003 in respect of defined benefit schemes was 5.1 million six months ended 31 December 2002: 3.2 million.

Employees continued Impact of accounting under FRS 17 Retirement benefits Additional disclosures regarding the groups defined benefit schemes are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits and these are set out below.
Qualified actuaries have performed actuarial valuations or updated recent actuarial valuations at 31 December 2003 using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Following the most recent actuarial valuation for the CMG UK scheme, the groups contribution rate was agreed as 15% for this scheme.
All the groups defined benefit schemes are closed schemes and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.

Profit for the period attributable to LogicaCMG plc As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the parent company.
The result for the financial year dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company, LogicaCMG plc, was a profit of 40.3 million six months ended 31 December 2002: 22.6 million.

In the current year and the prior period, the group made a loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders and consequently the effects of share options and the convertible bonds are anti-dilutive for the purposes of calculating unadjusted earnings per share.
Accordingly, there was no difference between the weighted average number of shares used to calculate unadjusted basic and diluted loss per share.
Earnings per share, both basic and diluted, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items have also been included as the directors consider this figure to be helpful for a better understanding of the performance of the underlying business.
Prior year adjustment The groups policy for recognising turnover was changed during the year following adoption of Application Note G of FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions.

These are the periods over which the directors estimate that the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
The provisional fair values of the net assets acquired of Nord IT, eGlobal Pacific and the Great Lakes Technologies Group have been adjusted in the current year.
These revisions resulted in an increase in goodwill of 0.9 million and relate to additional provisions for losses on fixed price contracts.
A reduction of 0.6 million was also required to goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Great Lakes Technologies Group following the lapse of contingent purchase consideration previously recorded.
Purchased goodwill of 0.6 million arose on the acquisition of the activities of a business process outsourcing company in the Netherlands in October 2003 see note 23.

Borrowings continued In September 2003, the group issued 303.4 million 2.875% convertible bonds due 19 September 2008.
The bonds were issued at par and bear a coupon rate of 2.875% per annum, payable annually in arrears.
Each 1,000 principal amount of a bond is convertible into one 2.875% exchangeable redeemable preference share of the issuer, LogicaCMG Jersey Limited, with paid-up value of 1,000 that will, in turn, be exchangeable immediately and mandatorily for ordinary shares of the company.
The bonds can be converted by the bond holders at any time between 29 October 2003 and up to 14 days prior to 19 September 2008.
The number of ordinary shares into which the bonds are convertible is determined by translating the principal amount into pounds sterling at a fixed exchange rate of 1.44862 1 and then dividing by the prevailing exchange price.
The exchange price is the price at which the sterling-equivalent par value of the 2.875% exchangeable redeemable preference shares is converted into ordinary shares of the company.
The initial exchange price on issue was 372.53p per share but is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
The bonds issuer may, at its option, redeem the bonds at any time from 3 October 2006 if the companys share price is greater than 140% of the prevailing exchange price on at least 20 dealing days during a period of 30 consecutive dealing days, or, at any time, if 85% or more of the principal amount of the bonds have been previously converted or purchased and cancelled.
The bond issuer may also, at its option, in lieu of redeeming the principal amount of the bonds in cash on the final maturity date, deliver ordinary shares of the company as determined under the conversion mechanism described above.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions The activities of a business process outsourcing company in the Netherlands were acquired on 30 October 2003 for cash consideration of 0.8 million 0.6 million.
The book value and fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was nil, giving rise to purchased goodwill of 0.6 million.
The profit after tax generated between 1 January 2003 and the date of acquisition by the activities acquired are not material to the group.
Disposals On 31 July 2003, the group disposed of its Radio Planning business which operated in the UK, US and Brazil.
The disposal resulted in the payment to the purchaser of 0.2 million as consideration for the transaction and a loss on disposal of 0.9 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2003, the Radio Planning business contributed 2.2 million to group turnover and a loss before interest and tax of 0.1 million.
On 1 November 2003, the group disposed of i2dm GmbH, a business incorporated and operated in Germany.
The disposal was for consideration of nil and resulted in a loss on disposal of 0.6 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2003, the i2dm business contributed 0.4 million to group turnover and a loss before interest and tax of 0.1 million.
The disposals of both the Radio Planning business and i2dm GmbH have not been classified as discontinued operations since they do not have a material effect on the nature and focus of the groups operations or result in a material reduction in turnover.
Financial instruments The main risks arising from the financial assets and liabilities of the group are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The groups policies with respect to managing these risks are set out below.
The group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
The group operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the groups risk.
Short-term debtors, creditors and provisions less than one year have been excluded from the disclosures below.
Management of cash and current asset investments Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including bank deposits, asset management funds and commercial paper.
Foreign currency risk Group companies have their local currency as their functional currency as the majority of turnover and expenses of group companies are denominated in their local currency.
To mitigate foreign currency risk, material contracted transactional amounts not denominated in local currencies of group companies are hedged by means of forward contracts, foreign currency options or currency overdrafts.
Remittances are then applied to the overdrafts.
The overdrafts are part of set-off arrangements against the positive cash balances of the group companies.
As a result of hedging provided by the use of currency overdrafts and forward contracts there are no material transactional currency exposures, which is consistent with the prior period.
For this reason, a table of foreign currency exposures as required in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments has not been presented.
The group does not hedge the translation effect of the consolidated profit and loss account.
The translation of the groups balance sheet has been substantially hedged by managing the currency mix of the group debt by the use of foreign currency borrowings and forward contracts.
The most significant consequence is to substantially hedge the groups euro denominated assets.
The selected currency mix takes into account the availability and cost of funds, and the sensitivity of group gearing and earnings ratios to exchange rate movements.
Interest rate risk The interest rate risk profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2003 was as follows: Financial Financial liabilities Floating Fixed assets on Floating Fixed rate rate rate 31 December on which no which no rate interest is financial financial interest is financial financial 2003 liabilities liabilities assets Total paid receivable assets Currency m m m m m m m Sterling 4.5 99.3 2.0 2.2 27.4 76.2 Euro 1.0 209.0 4.6 37.9 10.8 156.7 Other currencies 1.8 7.1 43.7 1.0 50.0 7.3 99.3 211.0 13.9 109.0 11.8 182.9 The interest rate risk profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows: Financial liabilities Floating Fixed Floating rate rate rate 31 December on which no 2002 interest is financial financial financial liabilities liabilities assets Total paid m Currency m m m m Sterling 1.5 112.3 3.1 0.2 116.7 Euro 0.8 124.7 0.1 77.5 48.1 Other currencies 0.4 0.2 55.6 55.0 2.7 237.0 3.4 133.3 109.8 Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid relate to provisions greater than one year and, at 31 December 2003, to other borrowings see notes 19 and 17 respectively.
Financial statements 71 LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements 24.
Financial instruments continued Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods of between one day and six months.
The weighted average period until maturity for floating rate financial liabilities on which interest is paid was 28 months 31 December 2002: 40 months.
Fixed rate financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 represent amounts outstanding on convertible bonds, finance leases and a short-term bank loan.
At 31 December 2002 fixed rate financial liabilities represented solely amounts outstanding on finance leases.
The average interest rate on fixed rate liabilities was 2.9% 31 December 2002: 6.9%.
The weighted average period for which rates are fixed on these financial liabilities was 56 months 31 December 2002: 26 months.
Financial assets generally earn interest at a floating rate based on relevant national LIBID equivalents or government bonds fixed in advance for periods ranging from one day to one month.
The groups policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and bank debt.
To ensure immediate access without material interest rate penalty, group cash and liquid resources balances were primarily invested on a floating rate basis throughout the year.
Liquidity risk The groups policy is to maintain sufficient headroom to meet its foreseeable financing requirements.
Substantial committed facilities are maintained with a syndicate of leading international banks.
At 31 December 2003 the group had committed floating rate facilities of 230.0 million 31 December 2002: 370.0 million of which 100.0 million 31 December 2002: 236.7 million had been drawn down.
During the year the highest amount drawn on these facilities was 294.5 million six months ended 31 December 2002: 258.4 million.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The book value of the primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations is not materially different from the fair value of those instruments, with the exception of the convertible bonds issued during 2003.
At 31 December 2003, the convertible bonds had a fair value of 215.8 million compared to a book value of 208.6 million.
Fair values of forward foreign currency contracts and currency swaps are based on the market price of comparable derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amount and fair values of the groups derivative financial instruments.
31 December 2003 31 December 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Derivative financial instruments held to manage the currency profile: 1.0 Currency swaps 2.6 3.5 Forward contracts Hedges The group hedges its net transactional exposure arising on trade debtors and creditors and all committed trade flows fully through the use of forward contracts and overdrafts.
The group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures on some product-related trade up to 18 months ahead through the use of forward contracts.
Currency risk on some contract bids is hedged proportionate to the likelihood of the contract being won.
For these contracts the currency risk is fully hedged once the contract has been won.
The table below shows the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in the next years, or later, profit and loss accounts.
