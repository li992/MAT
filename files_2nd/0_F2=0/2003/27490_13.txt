Principal accounting policies Accounting convention The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the special provisions of Part VII of the Companies Act 1985 relating to banking companies and banking groups, applicable UK accounting standards and the Statements of Recommended Practice issued by the British Bankers Association.
Accounting policies are unchanged from 2002.
The Group has made the additional disclosures required by the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, and has reclassified certain profit and loss account and balance sheet items as detailed in note 2.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings all of which have accounting periods ending 31 December.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Taxation Corporation tax is charged in the accounts based on the profit for the year as adjusted for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on a non-discounted basis.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided in order to write down fixed assets, which are included at cost, to their estimated residual value over their anticipated useful lives as follows: Freehold land and buildings 100 years Long leasehold land and buildings Over the period of the lease up to 100 years Short leasehold land and buildings Unexpired period of the lease Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings - plant 30 years - furniture 10 years - other 5 years Computer equipment - PCs 3 years - other 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Where the cost of freehold land can be identified separately from buildings on acquisition, the land value is not depreciated.
Provision is made for diminution in value of any fixed asset where an impairment is identified.
Annual impairment reviews are carried out for fixed assets with an expected remaining life over 50 years.
The resulting net book value is then written off over its remaining anticipated useful life.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they have been completed and transferred to the appropriate category of tangible fixed assets.
The costs of financing assets in the course of construction are not included in the costs of the assets.
Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings.
It represents the excess of cost over fair value of the Groups share of net assets acquired.
It is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset and is amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over its expected useful economic life.
The expected useful economic life is determined at the time of acquisition by considering the nature of the business acquired and the period of time over which the value of the business is expected to exceed the value of its net assets.
This period is ten years for recent acquisitions.
Goodwill is subject to impairment reviews in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
The carrying value is written down by the amount of any impairment, and the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which this occurs.
Leased assets Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to administrative expenses as incurred over the lease term.
Securities Debt securities and equity shares securities are held with the intention of use on a continuing basis and are stated at cost, adjusted to exclude accrued interest at the date of purchase, less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
A similar adjustment for accrued interest is made on realisation.
Where the adjusted purchase price differs from the nominal value, the premium or discount is amortised or released on an effective yield basis over the period to maturity.
Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements are retained on the balance sheet where the Group retains the risks and rewards of ownership.
Funds received under such agreements are included within deposits by banks or customer accounts.
Securities purchased under a commitment to resell are treated as collateralised lending transactions where the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership, and the purchase price is included within either loans and advances to banks or loans and advances to customers.
The difference between sale and repurchase prices for such transactions is reflected in the profit and loss account over the lives of the transactions, within interest receivable or interest payable as appropriate.
Pension costs Northern Rock operates a Defined Benefit Scheme and a Defined Contribution Scheme.
Contributions to the Northern Rock Defined Benefit Pension Scheme are charged to the profit and loss account with the objective of spreading the cost over the employees working lives within the Scheme.
Costs are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent valuation of the Scheme.
The costs of the Defined Contribution Scheme are charged to the profit and loss account for the period in which they are incurred.
FRS17 Retirement Benefits is being adopted under transitional arrangements.
Further information on pension arrangements is set out in note 7 to the accounts.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts Provisions against loans and advances are based upon assessments of the losses that are anticipated on outstanding balances at the year-end.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account comprises amounts written off during the year plus the net change in the amounts provided.
Bad debts are written off in part or in whole when a loss has been confirmed.
The loss provisioning methodology is as follows: Advances secured on owner-occupied residential property Specific provision Where the collection of interest and or principal on an individual loan is in doubt a specific provision is recorded.
Specific provisions are calculated using a model which is used to evaluate losses based on historical default experience and other appropriate risk factors related to the delinquent loan portfolio at a given point in time.
All loans which are three or more payments overdue are evaluated using the model to identify the need for a specific provision.
Loans six or more payments overdue and properties in possession are evaluated on an individual basis to measure potential loss.
Various factors are considered in this evaluation including, but not limited to, collateral valuations, expected recoveries from mortgage indemnity guarantees and estimated recovery costs.
47 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Provisions for bad and doubtful debts continued General provision A general provision is maintained to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio related to loans that have not yet been specifically identified as impaired.
A statistically based model is used to calculate the appropriate general provision for each completion year.
The model considers appropriate risk factors specific to the loan portfolio and historical default experience.
Other factors, including economic conditions, are also considered by management in determining the appropriate level of reserves required at a given point in time.
Interest in respect of all loans is credited to the profit and loss account as it becomes receivable.
Once a property is taken into possession interest charges are suspended.
If a property is sold at sufficient value, interest previously suspended is added back to the loan and released to the profit and loss account.
Other secured advances Specific provision is made as appropriate in respect of loans and advances that are identified as impaired at the balance sheet date, based on payment history, loan balance and net realisable value.
Interest is suspended on loans identified as impaired if its recovery is deemed unlikely.
General provisions are recorded to cover losses inherent in the portfolio which have not yet been specifically identified.
Unsecured lending Specific provision is made against all loans where three or more payments are overdue.
In calculating the required provision an appropriate factor is applied based on the number of overdue payments, which is subject to periodic review to ensure its continuing applicability based on current experience, to reflect the probability that not all such loans will result in eventual losses.
Repairs and renewals Repairs, renewals and refurbishments of a non-capital nature are charged to administrative expenses in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Deferred income The Company has entered into insurance arrangements with Northern Rock Mortgage Indemnity Company Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, to cover a proportion of future losses on certain residential secured loans with high loan to value ratios.
In the Group accounts, income from risk charges paid by customers in relation to such loans is deferred and is included in the balance sheet under the heading accruals and deferred income.
The deferred income is released to the profit and loss account on a level yield basis over the life of the loan.
Derivatives Derivatives comprise, mainly, currency and interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign exchange forwards and financial futures and options.
All transactions are undertaken for hedging purposes.
Transactions are initially recorded at cost and are accounted for on an accruals basis in accordance with the item or items being hedged.
Consequently, profits and losses on the hedges are recognised on a similar accounting basis as the profits or losses on the underlying item or items being hedged.
They are therefore recognised in the financial statements as adjustments to the profit or loss of the item or items being hedged.
To the extent necessary to achieve a consistent timing of income recognition on the item or items being hedged, deferred gains or losses are included in the balance sheet under the headings accruals and deferred income and prepayments and accrued income.
Profits and losses on early termination of contracts that modify the characteristics of designated items are deferred and amortised over the remaining lives of the hedged items.
Income and expenses on hedges are recognised as adjustments to interest receivable and interest payable.
When a derivative no longer represents a hedge, because either the underlying asset, liability or position has been extinguished or derecognised, it is restated to market value.
Any profit or loss is accounted for in interest income or expense.
It is then either redesignated as a hedge of a different asset, liability or position, is disposed of, or the position is otherwise closed, and accounted for accordingly.
Where a derivative is no longer a hedge because it ceases to be effective, it is restated to market value and any profit or loss arising is deferred and amortised into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the item previously being hedged.
Foreign currency transactions Interest income and expense denominated in foreign currency is translated into sterling at the rate of exchange current on the date of the receipt or payment, unless it is hedged, in which case it is translated at the underlying rate of exchange inherent in the associated hedge contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are hedged by means of matching foreign currency contracts are included in the balance sheet at the exchange rate inherent in those contracts.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are included at the rate of exchange current at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on currency conversion are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Mortgage incentives Incentive costs of discounts, fixed rate and other similar mortgage products are expensed in equal annual amounts over the effective incentive clawback period for early redemption of these products.
Early repayment charges, designed to recover incentive costs, are normally charged to customers on prepayment of loans within contractually agreed periods of time, ie the clawback period.
Other forms of incentives, such as valuation fees which are not directly linked to the interest rate on the mortgage, are expensed through the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
All incentives which are not subject to incentive clawback periods and any excess cost of an incentive over and above the cost recoverable by the clawback are written off as incurred.
The costs of mortgage incentives are charged against interest receivable.
Securitisation Securitisation transactions are reported in accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions.
Where assets are sold under securitisation, if there is no significant change to the Groups rights and benefits to those assets and its exposure is limited to a fixed monetary ceiling, linked presentation is used.
Under linked presentation, only the net amount of the Groups interests in the assets is consolidated, and the related gross amounts are shown on the face of the balance sheet.
The interest attributable to the Northern Rock Group is included in the profit and loss account under the heading interest receivable.
The other income and expenses are included within other operating income.
Where the conditions for linked presentation are not met, the transactions are accounted for by separate presentation of the gross assets and the related funding, and all profit and loss transactions are included within the appropriate captions in the profit and loss account.
The special purpose vehicles used for these transactions are accounted for as quasi subsidiaries see note 16.
Revenue recognition Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis, except for income on loans taken into possession which is taken to income when it is received.
Fees receivable from customers to reimburse the Group for costs incurred are taken to the profit and loss account when due.
Fees receivable relating to ongoing services are taken to income when the related service is performed, and fees in lieu of interest are taken to income on a level yield basis over the life of the loan.
48 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 2.
Securitisation changes in presentation a Interest payable on securitised bonds is deducted from interest receivable on securitised assets on the face of the profit and loss account using linked presentation.
In previous years the linked presentation was included within other income but has now been changed to be included within interest receivable.
This change has no impact on total income or profit and results in a more appropriate disclosure of net interest income.
b Northern Rock retains an interest sellers share in assets subject to securitisation via a master trust.
In previous years the retained interest was included within loans and advances not subject to securitisation.
This treatment has been revised so as to include such assets within loans and advances subject to securitisation see note 16.
This change has no impact on total assets.
The interest income received by Northern Rock in respect of the retained interest continues to be included within the profit and loss account heading other interest receivable and similar income.

Sale of credit card portfolio On 30 May 2003, the Group sold its credit card portfolio to The Co-operative Bank.
The surplus on sale amounted to 7.3m and is recorded in other income.
The credit card portfolio comprised approximately 90,000 accounts with outstanding balances of 217m.
As part of the agreement Northern Rock will offer credit cards, issued by The Co-operative Bank, to Northern Rock customers under the Northern Rock brand.

Pension commitments The Company operates the Northern Rock Pension Scheme the Scheme to provide retirement benefits for staff.
Staff who joined the Scheme before 1 July 1999 participate in the funded, contracted-out, defined benefit section of the Scheme unless they opt out.
Other staff, including those employed at 1 July 1999 but not members of the defined benefit section of the Scheme at that date, together with staff employed from 1 July 1999, participate in the contracted-in defined contribution section of the Scheme unless they opt out.
The assets of both sections of the Scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund separate from the assets of Northern Rock plc.
The Company has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits was issued in November 2000 but requires only phased transitional disclosures for the Company until the year ended 31 December 2005.
These disclosures, to the extent not given in a, are set out in b below.
a The most recent valuation of the Scheme was performed as at 5 April 2003 by Watson Wyatt LLP, consulting actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were that, over the long term, the rate of return on existing and future investments will exceed pension increases by 3.50% per annum and increases in pensionable earnings by 2.25% per annum.
At 5 April 2003, the market value of the fund was 158.6m which represented 97.5% of the market value of the benefits that had accrued to the valuation date.
The next full actuarial valuation is due to be carried out as at 5 April 2006.
During 2003, the Company paid employers contributions of 14.8% of basic pensionable earnings until 5 April 2003 and 15.9% of basic pensionable earnings thereafter 2002 13.8% until 5 April 2002 and 14.8% thereafter in respect of the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
In addition, members of the defined benefit section of the Scheme made employee contributions of 5% 2002 5%.
During 2003, the Company paid employers contributions in respect of the defined contribution section of the Scheme at an average rate of 6.0% 2002 6.0%.
Additional National Insurance costs were also incurred as a result of the defined contribution section of the Scheme being contracted-in to SERPS.
In addition, members of the defined contribution section of the Scheme paid contributions at an average rate of 4.3% 2002 4.3%.
The total pensions charge to the Group profit and loss account for 2003, as calculated by Watson Wyatt LLP, independent qualified actuaries, in respect of employers contributions to the Northern Rock Pension Scheme, was 8.6m 2002 7.7m, of which 7.0m was in respect of the defined benefit scheme 2002 6.5m and 1.6m in respect of the defined contribution scheme 2002 1.2m.
The charge for the defined benefit scheme in 2003 includes 3.6m arising from the underfunding of the Scheme adjusted for the level of prepayment 2002 1.6m.
In accordance with SSAP 24, surpluses and deficiencies, adjusted for the level of prepayment, are being amortised over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the defined benefit scheme, estimated at 13 years.
The prepayment in relation to the Scheme at 31 December 2003 was 30.6m 2002 32.1m.
b The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 5 April 2003 and updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the Scheme at 31 December 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.
The financial assumptions used to calculate Scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2003 2002 2001 Discount rate 5.40% 5.60% 5.75% Inflation rate 2.65% 2.30% 2.50% Pensions in payment increases 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% Deferred pensions increases 2.65% 2.30% 2.50% Salary increases 4.40% 4.05% 4.25% The assets in the Scheme and the expected rate of return were: Long-term Long-term Long-term rate of Market rate of Market rate of Market return value at return value at return value at expected at 31 Dec 2003 expected at 31 Dec 2002 expected at 31 Dec 2001 31 Dec 2003 m 31 Dec 2002 m 31 Dec 2001 m Equities 8.1% 96.0 8.6% 79.6 7.8% 93.1 Bonds 5.1% 74.9 4.5% 66.6 5.0% 34.3 Property 6.8% 7.4 6.5% 7.6 6.4% 6.9 Cash 3.8% 1.2 4.0% 0.4 4.0% 1.4 Total 6.8% 179.5 6.7% 154.2 7.0% 135.7 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 m m Scheme deficit: Total market value of assets 179.5 154.2 Present value of Scheme liabilities 226.1 181.7 Deficit in the Scheme 46.6 27.5 Related deferred tax asset 14.0 8.3 Net pension liability 32.6 19.2 50 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 7.

Market related calculations such as these are subject to daily variations.
The deficit disclosed does not represent a debt on the employer.
Contributions to the Scheme will continue to be determined in accordance with the Trustees' funding valuation, the next one being due in April 2006, or any interim valuations undertaken by the Trustees or the Company.
The rules of the Northern Rock Pension Scheme final salary section permit both employer and employee pensions contributions to be increased to meet part of any deficit.

This surplus has not been recognised in the accounts and accordingly no provision for the corresponding deferred tax liability has been made.
In the event that these securities were to be sold for market value, an additional tax liability would arise.
This would amount to 12.3m for the Group 2002 15.6m and 12.2m for the Company 2002 16.9m.
Profit on ordinary activities after taxation Of the profit on ordinary activities after taxation attributable to ordinary shareholders, 227.3m 2002 197.6m has been dealt with in the accounts of the Company.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys profit and loss account has not been presented separately.
Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per Ordinary Share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the holders of Ordinary Shares in Northern Rock plc of 274.6m 2002 229.7m by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue of 412.3m 2002 413.5m.
The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue has been determined after excluding shares held in trust for employee share schemes.
Fully diluted earnings per Ordinary Share have been calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue together with 3.6m 2002 3.6m potentially dilutive shares resulting from options granted under employee share schemes.

Securitisation Loans and advances to customers include portfolios of residential and commercial mortgage loans which are subject to non-recourse financing arrangements.
The loans have been purchased by special purpose vehicles, which have primarily issued mortgage backed fixed and floating rate notes to finance the purchases.
The Group is not obliged to support any losses in respect of these mortgages, except as described below, nor does it intend to do so.
This is clearly stated in the agreements with noteholders.
Northern Rock plc has made interest bearing subordinated loans to the special purpose vehicles, the repayments of which are subordinated to the claims of the noteholders.
In addition, mortgage indemnity guarantee MIG insurance is provided on certain loans to the vehicles purchasing residential mortgage loans by a subsidiary of Northern Rock plc.
Since 1 January 2003, Northern Rock plc has not taken out MIG insurance in respect of new loans.
Existing cover remains in force.
Northern Rock plc does not guarantee the liabilities of this subsidiary.
In the Group accounts, a separate presentation of assets and liabilities has been adopted to the extent of the insurance cover provided by the subsidiary.
Northern Rock plc has an option to sell further mortgage loans to the special purpose vehicles where at the end of any interest period the rate of repayment of principal in the vehicle exceeds the level agreed at the date of sale of the loans.
Northern Rock plc has no right or obligation to repurchase the benefit of any securitised loan except to the extent that the loan breaches representations and warranties given at the date of sale.
It does, however, have the option to repurchase loans from the vehicles, on being offered the opportunity to do so by the vehicles, where the borrower requests a further advance or a change in product type.
Northern Rock plc has entered into a number of interest rate swaps with the vehicles.
These convert interest flows from the mortgage loans into LIBOR based interest flows to match the interest flows payable on the floating rate notes.
During the year, Northern Rock plc assigned portfolios of residential mortgage loans with a book value of 10.5 billion to Granite Finance Trustees Limited.
Granite Finance Funding Limited acquired, at book value, an interest in the trust property vested in Granite Finance Trustees Limited.
This beneficial interest was acquired in three separate transactions, the first on 27 January 2003 for 3.0 billion, the second on 21 May 2003 for 2.5 billion and the third on 24 September 2003 for 2.2 billion.
Granite Finance Funding Limited funded its acquisitions through borrowings from its subsidiary companies, Granite Mortgages 03-1 plc, Granite Mortgages 03-2 plc and Granite Mortgages 03-3 plc.

At each payment date Northern Rock will decide whether to declare or defer the coupon.
If Northern Rock decides to declare the coupon, the holder will receive a cash payment equivalent to the coupon which, at Northern Rocks option, will be achieved either by the payment of cash directly, or by the issue of Ordinary Shares in Northern Rock which, when sold by a trustee in the market, will produce an amount equal to the cash payment.
If Northern Rock elects to defer the coupon, it may not declare or pay a dividend on any share until the deferred coupons are satisfied.
Deferred coupons and any interest accruing thereon can only be satisfied through the issue of shares.
The coupon has been swapped into a variable rate payment.
Northern Rock has a call option after 15 years, which it can only exercise with the consent of The Financial Services Authority.
If the issue is not called, the coupon resets to yield 4.725% above the prevailing 5-year benchmark Gilt rate.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Groups approach to risk management and the related use of derivative instruments is described below.
Risk management Management of risk is fundamental to the business of banking and is an integral part of the Groups strategic focus.
The Groups risk management governance structure begins with oversight responsibility by the Board of Directors.
Assisting the Board, the Audit Committee of Non-Executive Directors advises the Board on all matters relating to regulatory, prudential and accounting requirements that may affect the Group and reports to the Board on both financial and nonfinancial controls.
The Risk Committee comprising seven Non-Executive and the Executive Directors reviews the key risks inherent in the business and the system of control necessary to manage such risks.
In addition, the Asset and Liability Committee, which comprises the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and seven other senior executives, has been delegated the responsibility to oversee the management and review of the balance sheet risk and liquidity profiles.
The Asset and Liability Committee is supported by the director of Risk.
The director of Risk reports on and monitors risks throughout the Group and assists operational business areas in the formulation and implementation of appropriate risk management policies, methodologies and infrastructure.
Each business area is responsible for the identification and quantification of their particular operational and credit risk exposures and implementing risk management policies and procedures agreed by the Board.
Credit risk Credit risk is the potential risk of financial loss arising from the failure of a customer or counterparty to settle its financial and contractual obligations.
The overall day-to-day management of credit risk is delegated to individual business areas.
Each business area utilises various qualitative and quantitative techniques to measure and manage their respective credit risk exposures.
This includes the use of various credit risk mitigation techniques such as netting.
The customer loan risk management process incorporates sophisticated credit scoring systems to differentiate the credit risk associated with residential mortgage loans and unsecured loans, both at individual transaction and portfolio levels.
Credit exposure limits for corporates and financial institutions are primarily based on the credit ratings assigned by the rating agencies.
Credit limits are monitored by the Asset and Liability Committee to ensure they remain within authorised counterparty credit limits as detailed in the Credit Risk Policy Statement approved by the Board of Directors.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the mismatch in the cash flows generated from on balance sheet assets and liabilities, and the interest flows of off balance sheet instruments.
The Board of Directors has approved a Liquidity Policy statement which is compliant with the supervisory framework set by The Financial Services Authority FSA.
These policies ensure that the Group is able to meet retail deposit withdrawals either on demand or at contractual maturity to repay wholesale borrowings as they mature and to meet current lending objectives.
This is achieved by managing a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid assets, and a balanced maturity profile of wholesale and retail funds.
Regular reports are made to the FSA detailing the Groups sterling stock liquidity.
Operational risk Operational risk is the potential risk of financial loss or impairment to reputation arising from failures in operational processes or the systems that support them.
To minimise operational risk, the Group maintains a system of control commensurate with the characteristics of the business and markets in which the Group operates, best practice principles and regulatory considerations.
Where necessary, the Asset and Liability Committee will establish a project team, comprising senior business line managers, to devise and implement a suitable action plan to mitigate specific operational risk exposures.
Market risk Market risk is the risk to earnings arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and the price of financial securities.
i Interest rate risk As a UK based mortgage institution, Northern Rock offers numerous banking, mortgage and savings products with varying interest rate features and maturities which create potential interest rate exposures.
The Board of Directors has approved a Balance Sheet Structural Risk Management and Hedging Policy Statement that details the policies, procedures and controls for managing risk, including interest rate risk and the use of derivatives.
This policy is reviewed regularly by the Asset and Liability Committee which is responsible for ensuring that balance sheet exposures are managed within the Groups policies and operational limits.
All structural interest rate risk positions and interest rate sensitivity tests are reported to the Asset and Liability Committee on a regular basis.
ii Currency risk In addition to raising funds through the sterling money markets, capital markets and domestic retail savings market, the Group raises funds through issuing Euro Commercial Paper, US Dollar Commercial Paper, non-sterling denominated medium-term debt securities and non-sterling denominated retail funds.
The Groups policy is to fully hedge any exchange rate exposures by using cross-currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, or to match exposures with assets denominated in the same currency.
Any non-sterling denominated assets are also fully hedged in this manner or matched with non-sterling denominated liabilities.
Derivatives The Board of Directors has authorised the use of derivative instruments for the purpose of supporting the strategic and operational business activities of the Group and reducing the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
All use of derivative instruments within Northern Rock is to hedge risk exposure, and the Group takes no trading positions in derivatives.
For the purpose of reducing interest rate risk and currency risk, the Group uses a number of derivative instruments.
These comprise interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements, interest rate and bond futures, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The objective, when using any derivative instrument, is to ensure that the risk to reward profile of any transaction is optimised.
Where either an off balance sheet derivative instrument or an on balance sheet asset or liability could be used for a specific purpose, or where more than one derivative instrument could be used, the Group will select the instrument which optimises the following conditions: Minimise capital utilisation: Maximise income or minimise cost: Maximise liquidity: Minimise administrative and accounting complexity: and Minimise the Groups tax liability.
The benefits of using off balance sheet derivative instruments are measured by examining the anticipated consequences of not hedging the perceived risk in terms of revenue or capital loss.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued The following table summarises activities undertaken by Northern Rock, the related risks associated with such activities and the types of derivatives used in managing such risks.
Such risks may also be managed using on balance sheet instruments as part of an integrated approach to risk management.
Activity Risk Type of hedge Management of the return on variable rate assets Reduced profitability due to falls in short-term interest rates Receive fixed interest rate swaps Purchase interest rate options Sell forward rate agreements Purchase interest rate futures Fixed-rate lending Sensitivity to increases in interest rates Pay fixed interest rate swaps Sensitivity to decreases in medium long term interest rates, Purchase interest rate caps resulting in prepayment Impose early repayment penalty charges Fixed-rate retail and wholesale funding Sensitivity to falls in short-term interest rates Receive fixed interest rate swaps Fixed-rate asset investments Sensitivity to increase in interest rates Pay fixed interest rate swaps Re-financing of wholesale funding Sensitivity to increase in interest rates Sell bond futures Purchase forward rate agreements Sell interest rate futures Investment in foreign currency assets Sensitivity to strengthening of sterling against other currencies Cross-currency swaps Foreign currency funding Issuance of bonds in foreign currencies Sensitivity to weakening of sterling against other currencies Cross-currency swaps Interest earned on foreign currency denominated Sensitivity to strengthening of sterling against other currencies Forward foreign exchange debt securities contracts Purchase currency options Derivatives which are combinations of more basic transactions such as swaps with embedded option features, or which have leverage features, may be used in circumstances where the underlying position being hedged contains the same risk features, for example medium-term note issues based on equity indices or a multiple of an underlying floating market rate.
In such cases the derivative used will be structured to match the risks of the underlying asset or liability.
Exposure to market risk on such contracts is therefore fully hedged.
Credit risk on these contracts is monitored within tightly defined risk limits on the basis of the contractual terms of the instruments, rather than the face or contract amount.
The vast majority of the Groups derivatives activity is contracted with banks and other financial institutions.
The table below shows the underlying principal amount and positive and negative fair values of derivatives by type of contract.

At 31 December 2003 the potential credit exposure after allowing for collateral received was 194.0m 2002 238.7m.
The following table gives an analysis of the re-pricing periods of assets and liabilities on the Group balance sheet at 31 December.
Items are allocated to time bands in the table below by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate re-pricing date and the residual maturity date.

The gains and losses do not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on balance sheet instruments.
Currency risk No analysis has been provided of the Groups structural currency exposures on the grounds of materiality.
Where the Group has transactional currency exposures, it uses a variety of derivative products to eliminate this risk and therefore has no material transactional currency risk.
Fair values of financial instruments The table set out below details the book and fair values for some of the Groups financial instruments.
This analysis excludes those financial assets which are not listed or publicly traded, and for which no liquid and active market exists.
It therefore excludes loans and advances to customers, retail deposits and certain other balance sheet items.

Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market prices are not available, cash flows have been discounted at relevant interest and exchange rates to determine fair values.

Non-sterling assets and liabilities The aggregate amount of all assets and liabilities included in the balance sheet denominated in a currency other than sterling was as follows: Group Company 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Assets 2,362.3 1,597.4 2,351.0 1,595.0 Liabilities 9,463.9 7,449.5 9,463.7 7,448.9 The above assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling do not indicate the Group's exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group has no material net currency exposures as all borrowings in foreign currencies are either hedged with cross currency swaps or forward foreign exchange agreements, or are matched by assets denominated in the same currency.
Related party transactions i At the end of the year the aggregate amounts outstanding from Directors, their connected persons and Officers, in relation to loans from and other credit transactions with the Company, and the number of persons concerned, were as follows: Directors Officers 2003 2002 2003 2002 Number of persons 6 6 13 12 Aggregate amount 2.7m 1.5m 1.9m 1.9m ii The Companys total contribution payable under deed of covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation for the year ended 31 December 2003 amounted to 19.3m 2002 16.3m.

iii Except for the contribution to The Northern Rock Foundation, the Company has made no promotional and benevolent donations to organisations in which certain Directors and their connected persons hold positions of influence such as Directors, Trustees and Governors 2002 nil.
iv The Company has mortgage loans outstanding from its related companies.
Movements in these loans and provisions in respect of them during the year were as follows: m Cost: At 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003 0.1 Provisions: At 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003 0.1 Net book amount: At 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 v Northern Rock plc is a listed company and its shares are held by a large number of investors.
No investor acting individually has the ability to control the activities of the Company.
Consequently it is considered that there is no ultimate controlling party as defined in FRS 8 Related Party Transactions.
