Instead of using shares purchased in the market by the ESOT, the Company may issue new shares.
During 2003 1.2m shares were provided by the ESOT to employees to settle allocations due under the 2000 Share Bonus Plan and Performance Share Plan releases.
As at 31 December 2003 the ESOT held 12.5m shares acquired at a cost of 11.5m and with a market value of 12.5m, none of which were purchased during 2003.
The ESOTs investments are included at cost in the consolidated balance sheet within Other financial investments.
The cost of shares acquired by the ESOT has been nanced by an interest free loan from the Company.
The ESOT has waived its rights to the dividends payable on the shares it holds.
Convertible bond In December 2001, the Company issued 525m of convertible bonds due in 2006 which generated net proceeds after expenses of 515m.
The convertible bonds may be redeemed in 2005, and thereafter at the option of the Company, at par, provided the price exceeds 120% of the conversion price.
A coupon of 2.75% per annum is paid semi-annually and the bonds convert into ordinary shares of the Company at 184p per share.
The bonds would, if converted, give rise to the issue of 285,326,086 new ordinary shares representing approximately 4.4% of the current issued share capital.
The convertible bonds are included in the financial statements at an amount equal to the net proceeds after expenses.
The difference between this amount and the face value is amortised at a constant rate over the term of the convertible bonds assuming no conversion and is included in the profit and loss account as interest expense.
The carrying amount of the convertible bonds will equal the face amount at the maturity date.
In the event of conversion any unamortised costs relating to the converted bonds will reduce the amount credited to the share premium account.
Options Options over 105,329,391 shares are outstanding under CSOP, ESOS and SAYE schemes at 31 December 2003 as shown below.

The long term insurance funds represent the total assets associated with long term business less relevant creditors, valued in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 9A to the Companies Act 1985.
The principal area of operation for long term insurance business is the UK for which details of actuarial assumptions are provided.
For UK business, valuation assumptions have been determined in accordance with rules relating to the valuation of liabilities as published by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
Full disclosure of valuation assumptions, including the assumed margins for the risk of default on assets backing technical provisions, are disclosed in the Abstract of Valuation Report of the Appointed Actuary contained within the FSA returns of Legal & General Assurance Society Limited Society and Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited.
These FSA returns are due to be submitted to the regulator by 31 March 2004 and will then be available to any shareholder on request.

For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
Persistency Except for certain term assurances, valuation provisions are calculated as being the greater of the provision assuming that the contract continues in force until maturity, or, discontinues at the valuation date.
For certain term assurance policies, there is a liability on discontinuance within the first four years from inception and provisions have been calculated assuming lapse rates as follows: 2003 2002 Year 1 10% 10% Year 2 15% 15% Year 3 25% 25% Year 4 25% 25% For all years after Year 4 a nil lapse rate is assumed.
significant assumptions Long term insurance provisions, together with related reinsurance recoveries, are established on the basis of current information and are subject to subsequent reassessment as changes to underlying factors occur.
The results are particularly sensitive to the levels of future mortality including the incidence of critical illnesses and investment returns.
In the case of term assurances, including those that offer critical illness benets, a worsening in mortality experience leads to increased claim levels and hence reduced profit.
For annuity contracts the risk is that policyholders live longer than expected.
Term assurance is subject to reinsurance which mitigates the risk.
Annuity contracts are not generally reassured.
Calculation of technical provisions for non profit business requires assumptions on the required rate of return on the companys investments.
profits will be reduced if long term investment returns are lower than those assumed.
With-profits technical provisions are in part backed by equity type assets where the volatility of returns can have both a favourable and unfavourable impact on the companys ability to pay bonuses and on the funds capital position.
As profits from such business are related to bonuses, profits are also subject to some volatility.
However it is the Groups policy to smooth returns to with-profits policyholders through bonuses, and hence to smooth profits.
Changes to valuation interest rates for non profit business result from changes to the yield on the backing assets measured on a regulatory basis.
Society matches non profit assets and liabilities by duration, and, whilst changes in liabilities are therefore broadly matched by similar changes to asset values, the use of the regulatory basis for determining the valuation interest rate may also inuence reported profit.
For conventional with-profits contracts, a net premium valuation basis is used, with the valuation discount rate being reduced to make implicit provision for future reversionary bonuses.
Except for conventional with-profits contracts, a gross premium valuation basis is generally used to calculate the long term business provision.
For accumulating with-profits contracts including unitised with-profits, an explicit provision is made for future reversionary bonuses consistent with the yield on the assets assumed under the regulatory basis.
For all with profits business, the technical provisions make allowance for reversionary bonuses added to date but do not make either implicit nor explicit allowance for future terminal bonuses.
Other assumptions In calculating the long term business provisions for international long term business operations, locally accepted actuarial tables and interest rates are used.

Contingent Liabilities, Guarantees and Indemnities Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance of actual experience from that assumed may result in such liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of such contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them together in this paragraph liabilities.
The extent of such liabilities is inuenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the FSA, by ombudsman rulings, by industry compensation schemes and by court judgements.
The continuing general prole and emphasis being given by the FSA and other bodies to the suitability of the past sales of endowment policies in the context of some mortgage transactions has led to the continuing receipt of claims from holders of endowment policies.
On 27th November 2003, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited the Society referred to the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal Tribunal a Decision Notice issued by the FSA in relation to the sale of a small proportion of its mortgage related endowment policies issued between 1997 and 1999 66 Notice.
The matters contained in the Notice will be determined by the Tribunal later this year.
Provision for liabilities continues to be made and is regularly reviewed.
However, it is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact to which these liabilities may give rise.
The relevant members of the Group nevertheless consider that each makes prudent provision for such liabilities, as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet all reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
In 1975 the Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Ofce on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding nv the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Whether the Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
The Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given indemnities and guarantees, including interest rate guarantees, as a normal part of their operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions.

Pension Costs The Group operates the following pension schemes in the UK and overseas: Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund the Fund.
The Fund is a dened benefit scheme which was closed to new members from January 1995: last full actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2001.
Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme is a dened benefit scheme which, with a few exceptions principally transfers from the Fund, was closed to new members from August 2000: last full actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2001.
Legal & General Group Personal Pension Plan UK a dened contribution scheme.
Legal & General Staff Stakeholder Pension Scheme UK a dened contribution scheme.
68 Legal & General America Inc Cash Balance Plan a dened benefit scheme: last full actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2002.
Regime fide Retraite Professionnel France a dened contribution scheme.
Legal & General Nederland Stichting Pensioenfonds a multi-company dened benefit scheme.
This scheme is a multi-employer dened benefit scheme which, as the company share of the underlying assets and liabilities cannot be identied, has been treated for reporting purposes as a dened contribution scheme.
The contribution in respect of this scheme for the year was 0.6m.
All significant schemes have been subject to regular valuation or formal reviews by qualied actuaries who were employees of the Group.
There were no contributions prepaid or outstanding at either 31 December 2003 or 31 December 2002 in respect of these schemes.
The Group has no liability for retirement benets other than for pensions, except for a small scheme in France Indemnites fide Fin Carriere which provides for lump sum benets on retirement.
The Fund and Scheme account for virtually all of the UK and over 98% of worldwide assets, contributions and members of the Groups dened benefit schemes.
The actuarial value of the combined assets of the Fund and Scheme at 31 December 2001, the date of the last full actuarial valuation, was 506m, sufficient to cover 111% of the accrued members benets.
The surpluses of the Fund and Scheme based on this valuation were being amortised over 11 years the average expected remaining service lives of the members of the current schemes using the percentage of pay amortisation method.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries of the dened benefit schemes for this valuation under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 were: Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.75% Retail price index 4.00% Rate of growth in dividend income 4.00% Rate of return on investment 8.00% Rate of interest applied to discount liabilities 8.00% Rate of increase in salaries, excluding promotional increases 6.00% The actuary of the Fund and Scheme has conducted a preliminary review based on the last full valuation from which the actuarial value of the combined assets at 31 December 2003 have been established at 542m, sufficient to cover 92% of the accrued members benets with the average expected remaining service lives of the members increasing to 12 years.
Following the increases in contribution rates made by Legal & General over the past year, with effect from 1 January 2004 the Fund and Scheme will cease being non-contributory schemes.
From this date members have been able to elect to contribute up to 5% of their pensionable salary and retain the existing level of benefit or accrue benets at a lower rate.
The average contribution rate of pensionable salary in 2003 was 22.7% 2002: 12.7%.
All of the dened benefit schemes are valued under the projected unit method.
As the Fund and Scheme are effectively closed to new members, the current service costs will increase as the age prole of active members rises.
