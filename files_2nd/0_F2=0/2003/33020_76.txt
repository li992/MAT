The majority of this non-distributable amount relates to profit arising on the sale of Astra AB to a subsidiary in 1999, which becomes distributable as the underlying receivable is settled in cash.
During 2003, $1,749m of the profit was realised by repayment.
Subsequent to the year end a further $1,124m was repaid on 27 January 2004 resulting in additional distributable reserves not included in the figures above.
Included in other reserves is a special reserve of $157m, arising on the redenomination of share capital in 1999.
