3 890 000 ordinary shares were purchased in the year ended 30 June 2003 for an aggregate purchase price of US$20 million, which was funded by the BHP Billiton Group.
The cost of purchasing these shares was deducted from shareholders funds.
There is no intention to trade these shares and no dividends are paid in respect of them outside the BHP Billiton Group.
Normally, the Companies Act 1985 requires that interests in own shares be included in the balance sheet as an asset.
However, in this case the Directors consider that the arrangements are such that the shares owned by Nelson Investment Limited have effectively been repurchased by the BHP Billiton Group and so do not constitute an asset of the BHP Billiton Group and that to show them as such would fail to show a true and fair view.
BHP Billiton Plc previously entered into a similar arrangement under which it contingently agreed to purchase its own shares from a special purpose vehicle Strand Investment Holdings Limited established for that purpose during the year ended 30 June 1999.
During the year ended 30 June 2001 the shares held by Strand Investment Holdings Limited were reissued and no shares were held at 30 June 2001, 2002 or 2003. b Contributed equity reduced in 2001 by US$650 million due to the spin-off of OneSteel Limited, including costs of US$30 million.
This reflected a capital reduction of 66 Australian cents per share.
The spin-off resulted in BHP Billiton Limited shareholders being issued one OneSteel Limited share for every four shares held in BHP Billiton Limited.

27 Pensions and post-retirement medical benefits Pension Schemes The BHP Billiton Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The more significant schemes relate to businesses in Australia, South Africa, the US, Canada and Europe.
2003 2002 2001 US$M US$M US$M The pension charge for the year is as follows: Defined contribution schemes 41 61 66 Industry-wide schemes 23 1821 a Defined benefit schemes Regular cost 46 59 48 Variation cost 39 14 4 Interest cost 20 18 13 129 134 1 26 a Excludes net exchange gains losses on net monetary pension prepayments in 2003 of US$39 million gain 2002: US$24 million gain: 2001: US$33 million loss.
To the extent that there is a difference between pension cost and contributions paid, a prepayment and or liability arises.
The accumulated difference recorded in the balance sheet at 30 June 2003 gives rise to a prepayment of US$270 million 2002: US$224 million and a liability of US$65 million 2002: US$31 million.
The assets of the defined contribution schemes and the industry-wide schemes are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these schemes is calculated on the basis of contributions due in the financial year.
The remaining pension schemes are defined benefit schemes.
Some of the defined benefit schemes have their assets held separately in independently administered funds and others are unfunded.
The pension costs and funding for these schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries based on the most recent actuarial valuations available.
The pension charge for the year for defined benefit schemes has increased from US$55 million to US$65 million largely due to negative investment returns of plans in the US, Canada and Europe causing a deterioration of the funded status for these plans and leading to increased variation costs.
In addition, new legislation in South Africa regarding the apportionment of surpluses, which will most likely eliminate the Groups entitlements to any fund surpluses in South Africa, has also led to increased variation costs in relation to prior years.
BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003 131 Notes to Financial Statements continued 27 Pensions and post-retirement medical benefits continued For accounting purposes, the actuarial valuations have determined pension costs for most schemes using the projected unit method.
There are exceptions for some schemes that are closed to new members where the attained age method was used.
The assumptions used varied by scheme.
For the purposes of calculating the pension charge, surpluses or deficiencies are recognised through the variation cost component in future accounting periods as a constant percentage of estimated future payroll over the remaining service life of the employees.
Actuarial valuations used for accounting purposes The actuarial valuations used for accounting purposes reflected an aggregate market value at 1 July 2002 of US$890 million.
The funding levels of these schemes ranged from 53 per cent to 193 per cent and the overall funding level was 93 per cent.
Formal actuarial valuations Set out below are details for the three largest schemes of the actuarial assumptions and results of the most recent formal valuations for funding purposes.
The actuarial assumptions and results differ from those used for accounting purposes.

Post-retirement medical benefits The BHP Billiton Group provides medical benefits, which are not pre-funded, for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa, the US, Canada and Suriname.
The post-retirement benefit charge, net of employees and retirees contributions paid, in respect of these benefits was US$26 million 2002: US$16 million: 2001: US$15 million excluding an exchange loss of US$22 million 2002: gain US$14 million: 2001: gain US$9 million.
The charge has been calculated in accordance with UK applicable accounting standards.
Where there is a surplus or deficiency between the accrued liability and the provision recorded, the resulting amount is spread forward over future working lifetimes through the variation cost component.
The main actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuations of these benefits are as follows: South Africa US Canada Suriname Ultimate healthcare inflation rate 9.0% 5.5% 3.0% 5.0% Discount rate 11.75% 7.5% 6.5% 6.5% FRS 17 Retirement Benefits Whilst the SSAP 24 disclosure and measurement principles have been applied in accounting for pensions and post-retirement medical benefits in these financial statements, additional disclosures are provided under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The eventual aim of FRS 17 is to move from a long-term approach under SSAP 24 to a market-based approach in valuing the assets and liabilities arising from an employers retirement benefit obligations and any related funding.
This will impact both the amount and disclosure of the retirement benefits charge in the profit and loss account and the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL.
The net retirement benefit and a liability will be recognised in full on the balance sheet with a consequential impact on shareholders funds.
Currently, FRS 17 only has to be applied to disclosures.
This is the third year that disclosures have been made for the BHP Billiton Group under FRS 17.
The BHP Billiton Group does not apply the provisions of FRS 17 for the purposes of measuring pension charge and pension balances in these financial statements.
It is currently expected that FRS 17 will be first effective in such a manner for the 30 June 2006 financial year.

Under this Act, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified under Regulations to the Act, to improve current and former members benefits prior to the employer obtaining any benefit from the surpluses.
Consequently, it is considered unlikely that any BHP Billiton Group company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes.
Therefore the reduction in the recognised surpluses in South Africa is recognised as an actuarial loss in the STRGL.

Notwithstanding this, the Group expects that the allocation of goodwill to reporting units that are fundamentally based on depleting reserves of minerals and finite lived assets will lead to regular impairments of goodwill.
Such impairments will result in charges to income.
The Group, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, will be conducting annual impairment reviews.
These are scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of each year.

Our reserves have been calculated using the economic interest method and represent our net interest volumes after deduction of applicable royalty, fuel and flare volumes.
Our reserves have been subjected to economic tests to demonstrate their commerciality under prices and costs existing at the time of the estimates.
Our reserves include quantities of oil, condensate and LPG which will be produced under several production and risk sharing arrangements that involve us in upstream risks and rewards but do not transfer ownership of the products to us.
At 30 June 2003, approximately 19 per cent 2002: 17 per cent: 2001: 14 per cent of proved developed and undeveloped oil, condensate and LPG reserves and nil 2002: nil: 2001: nil of natural gas reserves are attributable to those arrangements.
Our reserves also include volumes calculated by probabilistic aggregation of certain fields that share common infrastructure.
These aggregation procedures result in enterprise-wide proved reserves volumes, which may not be realised upon divestment on an individual property basis.

Change in the Ore Reserves tonnages compared to the previous statement results from the depletion of Ore Reserves through production, the application of a mining recovery factor to the stockpiled resources to generate stockpiled reserves and the reclassification of some probable oxide reserves as mixed reserves or waste.
The use of a variable cut-off grade strategy during the production period has also resulted in the reclassification of some sulphide ore into LG Float ore. LG Float ore extracted from the pit is stockpiled in the LG leach stockpile resulting in a reclassification to stockpiled LG leach resource.
Measured Resource for Mixed ore has been downgraded to Probable Reserve to reflect uncertainty in some of the modifying factors.
Stockpiled material is included in the appropriate ore reserve estimate as Proved Reserve with the exception of Mixed ore. Economic pit limits were determined using the Whittle 4X software package: Ore Reserves herein quoted are based on the Ultimate Pit 42NB, generated using Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources for Sulphide and Oxide material types only.
This practice allows the maximum size of the pit to be used in strategic mine planning activities and reasonably reflects the future mining potential of the deposit, subject to future infill drilling.
Reported Proved and Probable Reserves are derived from Measured and Indicated Resources only within the Ultimate Pit, after modifying factors have been applied.
The Ultimate Pit obtained by removal of Inferred Resources from the pit optimisation is smaller Ultimate Pit 42SP, and as a result has a lower reserve base.
Proved and Probable Reserves in this smaller pit, including stockpiled ore, are reduced to: Sulphide ore: 1417 Mt at 1.24 per cent TCu, LG Float ore: 453 Mt at 0.60 per cent TCu, Mixed ore: 45 Mt at 1.10 per cent TCu and 0.34 per cent SCu, and Oxide ore: 186 Mt at 0.72 per cent SCu.
As there are differences in convention within the industry as to which reserves numbers to publicly report, both are provided to maintain transparency.
The Inferred Resources located within the mine plan declared in the previous statement June 2002, did not include 27 million tonnes at 1.21 per cent TCu, which has been corrected in this declaration.
The downgrading of Measured Resource to Probable Reserve for Mixed ore was omitted from the previous statement and has been corrected in this declaration.
5 An Ore Reserve has been declared at Escondida Norte for the first time in 2003.
The Escondida Norte deposit is a supergene-enriched porphyry copper deposit of Oligocene age in which two major stages of sulphide and one stage of oxide mineralisation contributed to the formation of a giant copper deposit.
The principal copperbearing minerals are chalcocite, chalcopyrite and brochantite antlerite.
The copper mineralisation is a satellite ore body of the main Escondida mineralisation located 5km to the north.
The western extension of Escondida Norte is named the Zaldivar deposit, currently mined in an open pit by Cia.
The final feasibility study of Escondida Norte was approved by BHP Billiton and its partners in June 2003 as part of the Escondida strategy to maintain copper production capacity in future years.
Development costs are estimated at US$400 million, which include pre-mine development, new mining equipment, a primary crusher with an overland conveyor, and maintenance and operating support facilities.
Pre-mine activities are programmed to start in September 2003 and copper production from the Escondida Norte deposit is scheduled for the fourth quarter of CY2005.
The deposit will be mined using open pit, bulk-mining methods with mineral processing through conventional flotation to produce a high-grade copper concentrate and oxide heap leaching to produce copper cathode.
The mine design is based on truck and shovel methods with direct haulage of waste and in-pit crushing of ore, for a total material movement of approximately 450,000 tonnes per day tpd.
Escondida Norte Sulphide ore will be processed at an initial rate of approximately 85 000 tpd, increasing to 100 000 tpd after two years of copper production.
Sulphide ore will feed both the existing Los Colorados concentrator and the new Laguna Seca concentrator, blended with Escondida ore. 6 Third party reserve audits have been undertaken on Cannington and Tintaya in the past three years.
7 %TCu per cent total copper, %SCu per cent soluble copper.
8 Tintaya Sulphide production was temporarily halted in November 2001 as a reaction to oversupply in the global copper market, and the oxide operation was commissioned during the year.
Tintaya Sulphide production is being restarted during the first half of FY2004.
9 Test work done on M4 material mined early in the pit life and currently contained in the 4155W stockpile and 4174 Finger B stockpile has indicated that this material is not economically millable.
1.7 Mt has been excluded from the Reserve and Resource estimate.
In early June of 2003, an area of Phase 2 and Phase 3 was identified as containing a high percentage of total copper present as oxides and secondary sulphides.
This type of material has previously demonstrated poor metallurgy.
A preliminary interpretation of the extent of this zone has outlined approximately 6 Mt of previously included Reserve material and 1.7 Mt of Resource material.
Test work is ongoing on this material to determine its true economic viability.
Consequently, until such time as proven otherwise, this material has been excluded from the Antamina Reserve and Resource estimation numbers.
