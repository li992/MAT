Accounting Policies The accounts have been pre p a red in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are : a Basis of accounting The Group pre p a res its accounts on an historical cost basis.
b C o n s o l i d a t i o n The Group accounts include the results of the holding company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30th June 2003.
The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date when control passed to the G roup using the acquisition method of accounting.
All transactions with subsidiaries and inter-company profits or losses a re eliminated on consolidation.
"Prior to the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard Number 10, ""Goodwill and intangible assets"", goodwill arising on consolidation as a result of the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings was written o ff against re s e rves in the year of acquisition."
This goodwill has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.
Any good w i l l written off against re s e rves will be charged to the profit and loss account in the event of the disposal of the re l a t e d b u s i n e s s. c Tu rn o v e r Tu rnover comprises the total proceeds of building and development on legal completion and the value of work executed on long-term contracts during the year excluding inter-company transactions and value added tax.
The sale pro c e e d s of part exchange houses are not included in turn o v e r. d P ro p e rties held for sale P ro p e rties held for sale, comprising pro p e rties previously held for investment, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
e S t o c k s Stocks and work in pro g ress, excluding long term contracting work in pro g ress, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
P rofit on contracting is taken on short term contracts when completed, and for long term contracts attributable pro f i t is taken when the final outcome can be foreseen with reasonable certainty: provision is made for any anticipated losses.
Amounts by which turnover in respect of long term contracts exceed payments on account are held in debtors as amounts recoverable on contracts.
Amounts received in respect of long term contracts, in excess of amounts re f l e c t e d 3 9 in turn o v e r, are held in creditors as payments on account.
f D e p re c i a t i o n F reehold pro p e rties are depreciated on a straight line basis over twenty five years.
Plant is depreciated on a straight line basis over its expected useful life which ranges from one to seven years.
g Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in equal installments over the life of the lease.
h Exchange translations F o reign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Tr a d i n g results are translated at the average rate prevailing during the relevant period.
Diff e rences arising on the re - t r a n s l a t i o n of the net investment and the results for the year are taken directly to re s e rves together with the diff e rences on fore i g n c u rrency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in f o reign subsidiary undertakings.
All other foreign exchange diff e rences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
i D e f e rred taxation D e f e rred tax is recognised in respect of all timing diff e rences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is re g a rded as recoverable and there f o re recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be re g a rded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing diff e rences can be deducted.
D e f e rred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
j P e n s i o n s The cost of providing re t i rement pensions and related benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the period s benefiting from the employees' services.
The effects of variations from regular cost arising from actuarial valuations of the pension scheme are spread over the expected average remaining service lives of the members of the scheme.
The d i ff e rence between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the scheme is shown as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
k Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are re c o rded at historic cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
