Accounting policies The following paragraphs describe the main policies: a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in compliance with all applicable accounting standards, the requirements of the Financial Services Authority and, except for the treatment of grants and contributions on infrastructure assets, with the Companies Act 1985.
An explanation of this departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 is given in note 1h.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, each made up to 31 March 2003, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of joint ventures and associated undertakings on the basis of their latest financial statements.
The results of any undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
c Turnover Turnover, excluding Value Added Tax, represents the income receivable in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
d Landfill tax Landfill tax is included within both turnover and operating costs.
e Intangible fixed assets and amortisation From 1 April 1998 goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings, representing the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised and classified as an asset on the balance sheet.
Where goodwill has a finite economic life, it is amortised evenly over that period.
Previously such goodwill arising on acquisitions was written off directly to Group reserves.
When a subsidiary, joint venture or associated undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill or the goodwill previously written off to Group reserves.
Accounting policies continued f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation i Infrastructure assets being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls Infrastructure assets comprise a network that, as a whole, is intended to be maintained in perpetuity at a specified level of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancement of the network, in accordance with defined standards of service, and to the maintenance of the operating capacity of the network, is treated as an addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge on infrastructure assets represents the level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capacity of the network and is calculated from an independently certified asset management plan.
ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of a landfill site is depreciated over its estimated operational life taking account of the usage of void space.
Cost includes acquisition and development expenses.
iii Other assets including properties, overground plant and equipment Other assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs that are incremental to the Group.
g Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets at their equivalent capital value and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter.
The corresponding liability is recorded as a creditor.
The interest element of the rental costs is charged against profits, using the actuarial method, over the period of the lease.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits in the year they are incurred.
Pennon Group Plc 35 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued h Grants and contributions Grants and contributions receivable in respect of capital expenditure on non-infrastructure assets are included in the balance sheet as deferred income and are released to profits over the depreciable lives of the assets to which they relate.
Grants and contributions receivable relating to infrastructure assets have been deducted from the cost of tangible fixed assets.
This is not in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 which requires tangible fixed assets to be shown at cost and hence grants and contributions as deferred income.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 is, in the opinion of the Directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view as while a provision is made for depreciation of infrastructure assets, these assets do not have determinable finite lives and therefore no basis exists on which to recognise grants and contributions as deferred income.
The effect of this treatment on the value of tangible fixed assets is disclosed in note 13.
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of expenditure charged against profits in the year have been included in the profit and loss account.
i Investments Listed investments held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Short-dated unlisted securities held as current assets are stated at cost plus accrued income.
j Fixed asset investment in own shares and impairment Shares acquired under the Employee Share Ownership Plan, a discretionary trust, are recognised on the balance sheet at cost of acquisition less impairment, being the charge to profits over the period to which the employees performance relates.
k Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials and an element of overheads.
l Pension costs The expected cost of pensions in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is charged against profits so as to spread evenly the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
A pension surplus or deficit is released or charged to profits, using the straight line method, over the average remaining service lives of employees in the scheme.
Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged against profits in the year in which they are incurred.
The financial statements reflect, as set out in note 30, only the disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits.
m Research and development expenditure Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
Accounting policies continued n Taxation Tax payable on profits for the year is provided at current rates.
Tax deferred or accelerated as a result of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes is provided in full.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material the current amount of the reversals of tax deferred is discounted to its present value.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included in the tax charge.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the deferred tax asset can be recovered in future periods.
o Foreign currency Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates for the relevant accounting period.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in overseas enterprises at closing rates, offset by translation differences on foreign currency loans and forward currency contracts which hedge such investments, are dealt with in reserves.
p Environmental and landfill restoration costs Provisions for restoration, aftercare and environmental control costs are made when an obligation arises.
Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits a tangible fixed asset is recognised.
Provisions are otherwise charged against profits.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material the current amount of the provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle obligations.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included as a financial item within net interest payable.
q Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate risks.
All such hedging instruments, including interest differentials which arise, are matched with their underlying hedged item.

Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities After taking into account interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities was: Financial assets Financial liabilities 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Floating rate 187.7 289.2 549.2 636.6 Fixed rate 4.3 4.4 630.4 406.7 On which no interest is paid 0.8 0.6 19.9 19.9 192.8 294.2 1,199.5 1,063.2 Which is included in: Net debt 191.0 292.0 1,179.6 1,043.3 Provisions for liabilities and charges 1.7 1.7 Deferred income 18.2 18.2 Other long-term monetary assets 1.8 2.2 192.8 294.2 1,199.5 1,063.2 Fixed rate financial assets and liabilities: Weighted average interest rate 6.3% 6.6% 6.7% 8.3% Weighted average period for which rate is fixed 1.1 years 0.9 years 3.9 years 4.9 years Range of interest rates 3.5% to 3.5% to 4.3% to 5.1% to 8.0% 8.0% 11.3% 11.3% Financial assets and liabilities on which no interest is paid: Weighted average period until maturity 15.2 years 16.2 years All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
The floating rate financial assets earn interest, in some cases fixed in advance for periods up to twelve months, based on short-term money market rates.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, in some cases fixed in advance for periods up to twelve months, related to the London Inter Bank Offer Rate LIBOR or equivalent.
The maturity profile of floating rate and fixed rate financial liabilities is shown in note 26.
Other financial liabilities fall due for payment principally after five years.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate swaps are used to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates to ensure that at least 50% of net debt is at fixed rate: at 31 March 2003 63% of net debt was at fixed rate 2002 54% : at 31 March 2003 interest rate swaps to hedge financial liabilities, with a notional principal value of 435.0 million, existed with a weighted average maturity of 2.2 years 2002 200.0 million, with 1.4 years to swap from floating to fixed rate: and at 31 March 2003 floating rate interest rate swaps, to hedge financial liabilities with a notional principal value of 200.0 million, existed to swap LIBOR to European Inter Bank Offer Rate EURIBOR with commencement dates between 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2010 and maturing on 31 March 2030 2002 200.0 million.
The settlement of 18.2 million which was received when these swaps were entered into during December 1999 has been deferred note 22 and will be matched with interest charges on the underlying hedged debt over the period of the swaps.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not, therefore, an exposure for the Group.
Financial assets and liabilities exclude short-term debtors and creditors other than loans and obligations under finance leases falling due within one year.

Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The latest actuarial valuation of the main scheme was as at 31 March 2001.
At that date, the market value of the schemes assets was 215.1 million, and this was sufficient to cover 109% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pensions.
The valuation assumes that the investment return would be 5.75% per annum for past service and 6.75% per annum for future service, pensionable pay increases would average 3.5% per annum and that present and future pensions would both increase at a rate of 2.5% per annum.
The pension cost of the main defined benefit scheme has been determined on the advice of the independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The employers regular pension cost for the year is 11.5% of pensionable earnings 2002 11.5%.
The net pension charge for the year ended 31 March 2003 for the main scheme was 3.1 million 2002 2.9 million which benefits by 1.9 million from the amortisation of the actuarial surplus 2002 1.8 million.
Based on advice of the independent qualified actuary, employers contributions recommenced in April 2002 at 4.8% of pensionable earnings and have been further increased in April 2003 to 11.5% of pensionable earnings.
Pension prepayments included as debtors of the Group amount to 5.5 million 2002 6.8 million, representing the accumulated difference between the Group pension cost and employer contributions paid.
The Group accounts for pension benefits in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 was originally intended to change the basis of accounting for pension benefits from 2003 04, but full implementation has been deferred.
Under transitional arrangements applying to FRS 17, certain additional disclosures are still required and these are given below.
The full actuarial valuation at 31 March 2001 was updated at 31 March 2003 by the independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method, as required by FRS 17.
The value of the assets of the schemes has been updated to market value as at 31 March 2003.
The demographic assumptions used in calculating the schemes liabilities under FRS 17 remain unchanged from those used in the 31 March 2001 actuarial valuation.
The financial assumptions at each year end under FRS 17 were as follows: 2003 2002 % % Rate of increase in pensionable pay 3.50 3.75 Rate of increase for present and future pensions 2.50 2.75 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.50 6.00 Inflation 2.50 2.75 The assets in the schemes and the expected long term rate of return at the year end were: 2003 2002 Return Value Return Value %m %m Equities 7.00 119.0 7.75 151.6 Bonds 4.50 31.9 5.25 42.5 Other 3.50 8.4 5.00 15.6 Total market value of assets 159.3 209.7 Present value of schemes liabilities 244.2 216.8 Deficit in schemes 84.9 7.1 Related deferred tax asset 25.5 2.1 Net pension liabilities 59.4 5.0 Pennon Group Plc 63 Notes to the financial statements 30.
