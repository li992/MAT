NOTES ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31st March 2003 1 COMPARATIVE AMOUNTS The comparative results have been re-presented in 2003 to simplify the disclosures of exceptional costs.
In the financial statements to 31st March 2002 and in preceding periods, the Group treated all redundancy and restructuring costs, including those incurred in the ordinary course of business, as exceptional items charged against operating profit in the profit and loss account.
In the notes to the financial statements operating profit before such charges was analysed in the business line and geographical segmental disclosures.
Additionally, separate disclosures were made on the exceptional items in the notes.
The directors have reviewed this disclosure and have decided to simplify it and provide a more representative presentation of the results of the business.
Accordingly, redundancy and restructuring costs incurred in the ordinary course of business are now charged directly against operating profit without separate disclosure as exceptional items because such costs will continue to be incurred in future years.
This change does not preclude the Group from disclosing material items, as exceptional charges or credits, against operating profit in future years.
As a result of the above change, certain comparative figures have been re-presented as follows: a The Groups operating profit on the profit and loss account was disclosed as 231 million before exceptional items of 42 million.
It has been re-presented as 189 million.
The share of joint ventures and associates operating profit is now shown as 49 million.
In the prior year it was disclosed as 52 million before exceptional items of 3 million.
The 45 million exceptional items continue to be disclosed in note 6. b The Group tax charge was disclosed as 75 million before the impact of exceptional items of 14 million.
It is re-presented as 61 million, with the 14 million disclosed in note 6. c The reconciliation of operating profit to net cash inflow from operating activities in note 35 has been re-presented.
In prior years exceptional items included both redundancy and restructuring items and those relating to the disposal and termination of operations.
The former items have been adjusted over the normal cash flow headings as set out in note 35 and the latter remain treated as exceptional items.
Depreciation was disclosed as 165 million before exceptional depreciation of 11 million.
It has been re-presented as 176 million.
Provisions were disclosed as 36 million before exceptional provisions of 16 million.
They have been re-presented as 52 million.
Exceptional cash spent was disclosed as 54 million, which included 47 million relating to redundancy and restructuring spend.
This has been re-presented as 7 million and now relates exclusively to the termination of operations.
d The segmental analysis of the Groups continuing operations and the segmental analysis of the joint ventures and associates, set out in notes 2 and 3 respectively have been re-presented.
The operating profit is now disclosed after redundancy and restructuring costs.
In the 2002 financial statements these redundancy and restructuring costs were fully disclosed in the exceptional items note.
