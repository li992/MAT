c Pension costs The principal pension arrangement operated by the Group is a funded scheme providing benefits on both a defined benefit basis and a defined contribution basis.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
A valuation of the scheme is undertaken by an independent qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions to the scheme are paid in accordance with his recommendations.
The last formal valuation of the defined benefit arrangement for funding purposes was undertaken as at 1 August 2002 and used the attained age method.
That valuation has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2003.
In the formal valuation the assumption which has the most significant effect on the results of the valuation is the difference of 2.5% per annum between the yield on the funds assets over the rate of salary increases.
The assets of the defined benefit arrangement had a market value at 1 August 2002 of 20,234,000.
The value of the assets was sufficient to cover 72% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The shortfall is being debited to the profit and loss account over the expected remaining working lives of current employees.
The pension charge of 2,844,000 2002 - 1,858,000 includes 2,271,000 2002 - 1,286,000 in respect of the defined benefit arrangement and 573,000 2002 - 572,000 in respect of the defined contribution arrangement.
All prepayments relate to the defined benefit scheme.
The transitional arrangements of the accounting standard FRS17 require disclosure of assets and liabilities as at 31 July 2003 calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS17.
They also require disclosure of the items which would appear in the profit and loss account and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses were the full requirements of FRS17 in place.
For the purpose of these financial statements, all of these figures are illustrative only and do not impact on the actual 31 July 2003 balance sheet or on this years performance statements.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year comprise 1,559,000 of normal contributions and 9,805,000 of special contributions which were paid to address the deficit identified in the 2002 valuation.
Contributions and charges should continue in accordance with the most recently certified Schedule of Contributions until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the scheme due as at 1 August 2005.
Assumptions The assets of the defined benefit arrangement have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal actuarial assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 Inflation 2.5% per annum 2.5% per annum 3.0% per annum Salary increases 3.5% per annum 3.75% per annum 4.0% per annum Rate of discount applied to scheme liabilities 5.5% per annum 5.75% per annum 6.0% per annum Pension in payment increases 2.5% per annum 2.5% per annum 2.5% per annum Revaluation rate for deferred pensioners 2.5% per annum 2.5% per annum 3.0% per annum 55 Bellway p. l. c.
