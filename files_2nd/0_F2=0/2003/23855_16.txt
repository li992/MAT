Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the accounting policies used is set out below.
"The Company has prepared its accounts in accordance with the AITC Statement of Recommended Practice ""SORP"" for Investment Trusts dated January 2003."
No prior year adjustments resulted from the adoption of the new SORP.
a The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue account on the date on which it is ex-dividend unless there is sufficient evidence that they should be treated as capital.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short-term loans and deposits, interest payable and expenses of management are dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves.
c Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves realised and unrealised.
d Listed investments are valued at middle market prices.
Unlisted investments are valued at market prices ruling where an organised market in such investments exists: other unquoted investments are included at Directors valuation.
Where a price is not readily available the holding would be valued at cost unless circumstances indicate a different valuation is warranted.
In general, valuations are increased where a substantial arms length transaction has occurred subsequent to acquisition, at a price higher than cost.
Valuations are decreased where subsequent transactions have taken place at a price lower than cost or where Fidelitys Fair Value Committee is aware that the company is experiencing operating difficulties.
e All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue account within the Statement of Total Return.
Finance costs are calculated and allocated to accounting periods over the term of the loan on the effective yield basis.
f Gains and losses on the realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - realised.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - unrealised.
g Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the rate of Corporation Tax that is expected to apply when the timing differences are expected to reverse.

In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations: Euro borrowings to finance operations.
The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Company's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Short-term debtors and short-term creditors are excluded from the following analyses.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Financial instruments are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair value.
Investments are held at market value.
The Directors consider this equates to fair value and for cash book value approximates to fair value due to short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the long term fixed rate unsecured loans, whose fair values as at 31 December 2003 given below have been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current euro interest rates.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 2003 2002 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 4.96% per annum 39,766 35,309 35,334 32,546 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 5.54% per annum 32,439 28,248 28,838 26,037 72,205 63,557 64,172 58,583 33 Notes to the Accounts Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through two euro denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loans, which fall due for repayment on 29 December 2006.
The Company is therefore not exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increase in euro interest rates on these loans.
The Companys financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Company also has cash balances of 1,140,668 2002: 7,972,643 denominated in euros.
The rate of interest on the cash balances is currently 2.2% 2002: 3.63%, consequently the risk of a decrease in cash interest earned is low.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The interest profile of the Companys financial liabilities excluding short-term creditors, as at 31 December 2003 and 2002 was as follows: 2003 2002 fixed rate financial fixed rate financial liabilities liabilities Currency 000 000 Euro 63,557 58,583 2003 2002 weighted average weighted average interest rate interest rate Currency 000 000 Euro 5.22% 5.22% 2003 2002 fixed rate financial fixed rate financial liabilities: weighted liabilities: weighted average period for average period for which rate is fixed which rate is fixed Currency Euro 36 months 48 months Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and Balance Sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and loans: Movements in rates affecting short-term timing differences: Movements in rates affecting the income received.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
However, it has increased finance available to the Company for its investment activities with foreign currency borrowings, thereby hedging part of the movements which are a result of exchange movements.
34 Notes to the Accounts The Company might also be subject to short-term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in note 14 to the accounts.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 000 000 After more than two years but less than five years 63,557 58,583 63,557 58,583 The Company does not have any undrawn committed borrowing facilites.
Counterparty risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver either the shares on a purchase or the cash on a sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
There is also a counterparty risk associated with deposit takers.
35 Notes to the Accounts The Company buys and sells investments on a delivery versus payment basis to manage risk.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which have been approved by the Manager as an acceptable counterparty.
Additionally, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any broker at any time, the limits being reviewed on a regular basis.

The Company has entered into an arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland, whereby if total borrowings exceed 50% of the Company's assets, sufficient money is placed in a charged account with the bank to reduce borrowings to below 50%.
36 Notes to the Accounts The Company has also entered into an arrangement with National Australia Bank, whereby if total borrowings exceed 40% of the Company's assets, sufficient money is placed in a charged account with the bank to reduce borrowings to below 40%.
As at 31 Deccember 2003, there were no cash deposits with the bank subject to a charge in favour of either The Royal Bank of Scotland or National Australia Bank 2002: nil.
Redemption costs may be payable in the event of Directors electing to prepay the unsecured loans.
