The addition of Application Note G Revenue Recognition to Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions FRS 5 has not impacted the reported results and no adjustment to the recognition of revenue and profit has been necessary.
Following the issuance of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 the group has amended its accounting policy for such trusts.
This has resulted in the reclassification of own shares held as a deduction from shareholders funds and the restatement of comparative figures as set out in note 24 on page 78.
As required by the Companies Act 1985, the directors have adopted the true and fair override in respect of the accounting for the Exchange Property see note 17.
Basis of consolidation The accounts of the group consolidate the results of the company and its subsidiary undertakings, and include its share of its joint ventures results on the gross equity method, all of which are made up to 31 December.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for businesses acquired with fair values applied to the acquired operation.
The results of such businesses are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition, up to the date of disposal or closure.
From 1 January 2002, where the group contributes a business, or other non-monetary asset for an interest in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, such transactions are recorded so that the reduction in ownership of the business being contributed is accounted for as a disposal while the increased interest in the enlarged group or new interest in the business contributed by other parties to the transaction are accounted for as an acquisition.
Fair values are applied to those operations which are subject to the exchange and which have not previously been held within the group.
Any loss or realised gain resulting from the transaction is recorded in the profit and loss account while any unrealised gain is recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Prior to 31 December 2001 such exchanges of interest were recorded so as to reflect the economic substance of the transaction.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation, on an exchange of interest, or on acquisition of joint venture interests, is capitalised in respect of all transactions from 1 January 1998.
Such goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis through the profit and loss account over its estimated useful economic life, based upon assessments of the durability of markets, product ranges and projected future profitability of the businesses concerned.
Prior to 1998, goodwill was either capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account or was written off directly to reserves depending upon the circumstances of each acquisition.
To date all goodwill capitalised has been assessed as having a 20 year estimated useful economic life.
Impairment reviews are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year following each acquisition and also if events or changes in circumstance indicate that such a review is necessary.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit and loss on disposal or termination is calculated including any remaining capitalised goodwill or the gross amount of any related goodwill previously written off directly to reserves, as appropriate.
Company accounts In the companys accounts, all fixed asset investments including subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost or valuation in respect of certain listed investments less provisions for permanent diminutions.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the companys profit and loss account.
In accordance with section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The amount of the profit for the financial year of the company is disclosed in note 24 to these accounts.
Relief under sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985 is taken whenever possible.
Accordingly the difference between the fair value and aggregate nominal value of shares is not recognised in either shareholders funds or cost of investment.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 53 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Sales are recognised when the group obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, this is usually when title passes or a separately identifiable phase of a contract or development has been completed and accepted by the customer.
Sales comprise the net value of such deliveries made, work completed or services rendered during the year and include the groups net share of sales of joint ventures.
Turnover represents sales made by the company and its subsidiary undertakings, excluding the groups share of sales of joint ventures.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
In the case of contracts with extended delivery programmes, it is arrived at by reference to the estimated overall profitability of the contract and appropriate provision is made for any losses in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Foreign currencies Transactions in overseas currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward cover contracts have been arranged, at the contracted rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date or at a contracted rate if applicable and any exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account.
For consolidation purposes the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated at the closing exchange rates.
Profit and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency net investments are taken to reserves.
Research and development Group funded revenue expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred and charged to the profit and loss account, except where substantially supported under contract.
Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight line basis, to write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Research equipment 8 years Computing equipment, motor vehicles and short life works equipment 3 to 5 years Other equipment 10 to 15 years, or the project life if shorter In the groups North America business, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts.
Typically this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise on a straight line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Leases Assets obtained under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets at cost and are depreciated over their useful economic lives, or the term of their lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within loans.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged as interest to the profit and loss account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments, so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding obligation.
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis in arriving at operating profit.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in tangible fixed assets at cost less depreciation.
Rental income from aircraft operating leases is recognised in sales as the receipts fall due.
54 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost, including all relevant overhead expenditure, and net realisable value.
Long-term contracts the amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long-term contract is arrived at by reference to the estimated overall profitability of the contract.
Appropriate provisions are made for any losses in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Work in progress relating to long-term contracts is stated at cost less provision for anticipated losses.
Development properties the net realisable value is based on advice received from independent valuers and assumes the grant of relevant planning consent but excludes any development profit.
Cash received on customers account and customer stage payments Amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred upon stocks or work in progress for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance is held in creditors as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to company performance, as cash received on customers account.
Cash received on customers account is excluded from the figure for net debt as defined by the group.
Aircraft financing The group is exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing, both from financing arranged directly by the group and from that arranged by third parties where the group has provided guarantees or has other recourse obligations.
Provision for these risks is made on a systematic basis.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction, other than translational hedges of foreign currency investments which are taken to reserves.
Gains and losses arising from retiming of foreign exchange transactional cover are deferred to match the maturity of the underlying exposure.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
Short-term debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial asset or liability respectively have been excluded from the Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments FRS 13 disclosures where permitted by that standard.
Tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date where there is an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits These costs have been provided under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs SSAP 24 where the expected cost of providing pensions and other post retirement benefits, as calculated periodically by independent actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees.
The group operates several pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group.
The group has followed the transitional disclosure arrangements required by Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benefits FRS 17.
Share options In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 National insurance contributions on share option gains UITF 25 the group provides in full for the employers national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options granted, except where the employee has agreed to settle the employers national insurance liability as a condition of the grant of the options.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption offered in Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 Employee share schemes UITF 17 from charging to the profit and loss account the 20% discount offered to employees partaking in such company operated SAYE schemes.
As required under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 the cost to the company of own shares held is now shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the companys own shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Sales to JVs within other business groups are included in the intra-group sales adjustment.
Sales to JVs are reinstated to derive external turnover.

As the provisions were transferred to stock the net cash outflow arising in 2003 in respect of these exceptional charges has not been separately recorded.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 59 6 Exceptional items continued Prior year rationalisation programmes Rationalisation programmes were initiated in 1999 and 2000 in response to capacity excesses across a number of business groups.
The total costs associated with these programmes were estimated at the time of the respective announcements at 475m.
To date costs of 500m have been recorded as exceptional charges.
The profit and loss impact in 2003 has been a charge of 6m 2002 45m, before a tax credit of 2m 2002 12m.
The net cash outflow in 2003 amounted to 4m 2002 52m, before taking into account the cash benefits of tax relief.

Acquisitions MEVATEC Corporation In March 2003, the group acquired 100% of MEVATEC Corporation, in the US, for a cash consideration of 52m excluding cash acquired of 11m.
Provisional goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to 48m.
The company provides professional technical services to the US market and has been renamed BAE Systems Analytical Solutions.
In March 2003, the group acquired 100% of Advanced Power Technologies, Inc. in the US, for a total cash consideration of 18m.
Provisional goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to 15m.
The company provides communications and networking solutions to the US market and has been renamed BAE Systems Advanced Technologies.
Piper Group Plc In April 2003, the group acquired 100% of Piper Group Plc for a total cash consideration of 3m.
Provisional goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to 3m.
The company provides technology services.
Exchange of interests Atlas Elektronik In August 2003, agreement was reached on the final separation of the STN Atlas business, whereby the groups 49% joint venture interest in STN Atlas was exchanged for a 100% interest in its naval systems business, Atlas Elektronik.
BAE Systems has held full control of the naval business since 1 January 2003, so this has been deemed the date of the transaction for accounting purposes.
A provisional unrealised gain arising from this exchange of interests of 11m has been taken directly to reserves, in accordance with UITF 31 see note 24.
Adjustment to provisional fair values Post acquisition fair value adjustments of 11m have been made in respect of Corbett Technologies, Inc. and Condor Pacific Industries, Inc. which were acquired in November 2002 and December 2002 respectively.
These relate to the identification of deferred tax assets which have increased net assets acquired and consequently reduced goodwill on acquisition.
Charge for the year The charge for the year of 403m includes 20m impairment of goodwill relating to the Precision Aerostructures business within Commercial Aerospace.
Goodwill arising on joint ventures is set out in note 12.

The majority of the groups operational properties at that time were valued on a depreciated replacement basis, owing to their specialisation, with the remainder on an existing use value basis.
Other non-operational properties were valued on the basis of open market value: short leaseholds at cost: additions subsequent to 30 June 1996 at cost: and land and buildings owned by subsidiary undertakings acquired since 30 June 1996 at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following the adoption in 2000 of Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible fixed assets FRS 15 the company has elected that no further revaluation of land and buildings will be undertaken for statutory reporting purposes.

BAE Systems does not actively participate in the management and financial decision-making of Alvis and hence does not exercise the significant influence which would require treatment of its holding as an associate under the equity accounting method.
The holding is therefore accounted for as a trade investment.

In the opinion of the directors the consideration paid reflects the long-term value of the business and the investment carrying value is not impaired.

At any time prior to the due date the Bondholders have the right to request to exchange their Bonds for the Exchange Property, which is represented by the groups holding in the ordinary share capital of Vodafone Group Plc see note 15.
On receiving such early redemption notice, the company has the option to settle the Bonds in cash, based on the prevailing market value of the Exchange Property.
The company does not intend currently to use this option to settle any material proportion of the Bonds in cash.
The Bonds are recorded at issue price less unamortised issue costs, which represent the maximum economic exposure.
The value of the Exchange Property was initially based on the issue price of the Bonds, which represented the realisable value to the group.
The historical cost of the Exchange Property to the group is negligible, and the uplift to match the Exchange Property to the value of the Bonds was recorded as an unrealised gain within other reserves.
This treatment of the Exchange Property represents a departure from the normal requirements of the Companies Act 1985 under which current asset investments are to be carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
This basis would, for the reasons set out above, in the opinion of the directors not reflect the economic substance of the transaction nor show a true and fair view.
At 31 December 2003 the value of the groups holding in Vodafone Group Plc was less than the redemption value of the Bonds.
Accordingly the group has recorded the value of the Exchange Property at its market value at that date.
Movements in the market value of the Exchange Property have been offset against the original unrealised gain within other reserves, and disclosed as a non-cash adjustment in the consolidated movement on net debt.

Regional aircraft This provision contains the costs associated with the decision in 2001 to close the regional jet aircraft activities, principally manufacturing, and reorganise certain other commercial aerospace activities see note 6 and recourse provisions in respect of financing arrangements for aircraft previously sold by the group.
The recourse element of the provision covers costs to be incurred over the period to 2013 and the directors believe it is appropriate to state the recourse provision at its net present value.
Adjustments to the net present value are recorded within other provision movements.
Provisions arising from exchange of interests The amount arising from exchange of interests represents provisions held by Atlas Elektronik at 1 January 2003 see note 10.

At 31 December 2003 the groups future payments in respect of these arrangements were 2,717m 2002 3,077m.
As part of a restructuring of its gross obligations through the issue of a limited recourse bond in 2001, the group pre-financed certain of the residual value guarantees.
The future cash flows associated with this pre-financing totalled 594m at 31 December 2003 2002 740m.
A significant proportion of the net exposure of 2,123m 2002 2,337m is covered by a Financial Risk Insurance Programme FRIP which provides insurance cover in respect of potential shortfalls in contracted and expected income.
Any anticipated liability in respect of uninsured amounts is accounted for on a net present value basis.
Since the inception of the FRIP, the group has granted residual value guarantees in respect of aircraft sold totalling 400m 2002 375m.
After taking account of independent appraisal valuations the directors consider that the groups net exposure to these guarantees is covered by the provisions held, on a net present value basis, and the residual values of the related aircraft.
The group is also exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing and residual value guarantees given by Saab AB and Airbus SAS.
Provision is made against the expected net exposures on a net present value basis.
The groups share of such exposure is limited to its percentage shareholding in each of these joint ventures.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 73 21 Contingent liabilities and commitments Company guaranteed borrowings Borrowings of subsidiary undertakings totalling 975m 2002 1,197m which are included in the groups borrowings note 16 have been guaranteed by the company.
Guarantees and performance bonds The group and company have entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business.
Provision is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.

These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be sufficiently accurately predicted at this time.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of future remittances of the accumulated reserves of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures as there are no binding agreements entered into by the subsidiaries and joint ventures to distribute these past earnings.
No significant potential liability to tax is expected to arise if properties included at valuation in the accounts were realised at their revalued amounts.
In respect of rolled over capital gains the potential year end liability amounted to 26m 2002 26m.

Certain parts of the companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These Articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have an interest in more than 15% of the company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the chief executive and any executive chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
The 7.75p net cumulative redeemable preference shares of 25p each are convertible into ordinary shares of 2.5p each at the option of the holder on 31 May in any of the years up to 2007, on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share.
During the year 15,116 shares were converted for 7,241 ordinary shares.
The company may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time after 1 July 2007 and, in any case, will redeem any remaining shares on 1 January 2010, in each case at 100p per share together with any arrears and accruals of dividend.
The maximum redemption value of the preference shares, ignoring any arrears or accruals of dividends, is therefore 266m and this amount has been disclosed on the face of the balance sheet as the total of non-equity shareholders funds.
The preference shares carry voting rights at a general meeting of the company only where the preferential dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where a motion is to be proposed which abrogates, varies or modifies the rights of the preference shareholders, or where a motion is to be proposed for the winding up of the company.
On a winding up, holders of the preference shares are entitled, after repayment of the capital paid up on the Special Share and in priority to any payment to any other class of shareholder, to the return of amounts paid up or credited as paid up on the preference shares together with a premium of 75p per share, and all arrears of preferential dividends.

Prior year adjustment for Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 In previous years the group had complied with UITF Abstract 13 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 13 which has been superseded by the introduction of UITF 38.
UITF 13 required own shares held by the group through an ESOP trust to be included within fixed asset investments.
UITF 38 requires such shares to be shown as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
The effect of the implementation of UITF 38 has been to reduce the value of fixed asset investments, within net assets, and shareholders funds, reported at 31 December 2003 by 9m 2002 11m: 2001 13m for both the group and the company.
Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST During the year the group ceased operation of the Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST previously operated for the purposes, inter alia, of the SAYE Share Option Scheme 1993.
No contributions were made by the company to the QUEST during the year and no shares were held by the QUEST at any point during the year.

80 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Post retirement benefit schemes The group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
FRS 17 was issued in November 2000 but the Accounting Standards Board has deferred full mandatory implementation, which is now not expected before the year ending 31 December 2005 at the earliest.
Prior to this, transitional disclosures are required which, to the extent they are not given in note a, are set out in b. a Pension schemes The group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
The main schemes are funded defined benefit schemes and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension scheme valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding, SSAP 24 and FRS 17 purposes.
The details of the principal schemes, their respective latest valuation dates, and the financial assumptions used for the SSAP 24 valuations are given below.
Valuation method and date UK schemes BAE SYSTEMS Projected Unit Pension Scheme 5 April 2002 BAE SYSTEMS Projected Unit 2000 Pension Plan 6 April 2001 Royal Ordnance Projected Unit Pension Scheme 31 December 2001 VSEL section Attained Age Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme 1 April 2001 Principal assumptions used in the valuations for the UK schemes were that in the long term the average return on investments would exceed: 2003 2002 % % Average increases in pay by 2.00 to 3.00 2.00 to 3.00 Average increases in pensions by 3.50 to 4.00 3.50 to 4.00 Dividend growth by 2.75 2.75 Valuation method and date US schemes BAE SYSTEMS Projected Unit Employee Retirement Plan No 1 1 January 2003 As permitted under SSAP 24 the US schemes have been accounted for under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
Principal assumptions used in the valuations for the US schemes were that in the long-term the average return on investments would be 8.75% 2002 9.00% and average increases in pay would be 5.42% 2002 5.42%.
The aggregate of the market values of the assets of the principal schemes operated by the group at the latest date of actuarial valuation totalled some 9.7bn 2002 9.7bn.
The actuarial value of these assets covered approximately 100% 2002 101% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries.
The market value of these assets at 31 December 2003 was approximately 9.1bn 2002 8.0bn.
The net deficit is being amortised using the straight line method over the estimated average service lives of the related scheme members of 9 to 14 years.
The net charge to the profit and loss account amounted to 127m 2002 118m, excluding charges in respect of the contributions made by the groups joint venture companies.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 81 27 Post retirement benefit schemes continued Pension prepayments included in debtors of the group amounted to 532m 2002 434m note 14 and pension liabilities included in creditors of the group amounted to 107m note 18.
Cash contributions by the group to the pension schemes totalled 233m 2002 156m.
In addition, 62m 2002 57m of cash contributions were received into the various schemes from joint venture companies.
The group also incurred a charge in respect of the cash contributions of 32m 2002 31m paid to defined contribution pension schemes for certain employees.
As a result of the consolidation of the groups interest in Atlas Elektronik GmbH, following the exchange of interests detailed in note 10, a charge of 2m has also been incurred, with cash paid of 2m for pensions under this companys unfunded pension arrangements.
The estimated future liabilities as at 31 December 2003 totalled 49m and are included in the balance for pensions within creditors referred to above.
This scheme has been accounted for under the International Accounting Standards Boards International Accounting Standard No.
The groups pension funding requirements are derived from separate independent actuarial valuations required by the company and the trustees of the various schemes.
Post retirement benefits other than pensions The group also operates a number of non-pension post retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the groups subsidiaries in the US.
These schemes are generally unfunded.
The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2003.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The gross liability at 31 December 2003 amounts to 68m 2002 74m, all of which is held within provisions note 19. b Transitional FRS 17 disclosure The disclosures below relate principally to post retirement benefit schemes in the UK and the US accounted for on a defined benefit basis under FRS 17.
The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the surplus deficit of the schemes at 31 December each year.
Scheme assets are stated at the market value at 31 December each year and scheme liabilities are based on the results of the last actuarial valuation.

As these are multi-employer schemes it is not possible to separately identify the joint ventures share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
In consequence, the joint ventures account for the schemes on a defined contribution basis.
The group accounts reflect 100% of the movements on, and balances in, the scheme, net of the contributions received from the joint ventures.
Contributions received from joint venture companies include 6m in respect of Astrium, pending agreement of the liabilities and assets to be transferred following its disposal in January 2003.

As permitted by FRS 17, the schemes will be accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes when the financial reporting standard is fully adopted by the company and therefore no transitional disclosures are required.
The schemes are included in the FRS 17 disclosures set out above.

Currency management The companys principal currency exposure is the USdollar sterling exchange rate.
Following the formation of Airbus SAS, the USdollar exposure arising from the sale of Airbus aircraft has been managed through the joint shareholder treasury committee.
Hedging decisions have to be unanimously approved by the shareholders in this committee.
BAE Systems continues to hedge its forecast five-year USdollar transactional and economic exposures.
The group also has transactional currency exposure arising from exports supplies denominated in currencies other than the USdollar.
The groups policy is to hedge such exposures where appropriate using forward contracts.
Liquidity management At 31 December 2003, the group had undrawn revolving credit facilities RCF of 2bn 2002 1.97bn, of which nil expire in less than one year 2002 469m, 500m expire in more than one year but less than two years 2002 1,000m and 1,500m expire in more than two years but less than five years 2002 500m.
The groups commercial paper programme is supported by the RCF with any amount outstanding reducing the amount that can be drawn down.
As at 31 December 2003, 79m 2002 255m was outstanding under the commercial paper programme.
