Unless otherwise stated, the commentary in this statement compares results for the 368 day period from 1 January 2003 to 3 January 2004 2003 with unaudited pro forma results extracted from the management accounts for the 374 day period from 23 December 2001 to 31 December 2002 2002.

Air Systems Components showed strong margin recovery in the second half of the year.
Engineered & Construction Products increased underlying sales and operating profit before operating exceptional items and goodwill amortisation for the year by 2.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively.

During 2003, we founded the Tomkins College at the highly respected University of Indiana.
The courses provide the opportunity for our people to develop the financial skills that will enhance their future decisionmaking at Tomkins.
Using the first years accomplishments as a springboard for the future, three new courses are being added to the Tomkins College curriculum in 2004.
DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS Tomkins Electro-Mechanical Drive system will go into initial production on a 2 PSA Peugeot Citron vehicle during the second half of 2004.
Our proprietary technology stops the engine when the vehicle is stationary and restarts it automatically, in a split second, when the driver wishes to move away.
Deployment of this stop-and-start technology will be driven by the significant fuel savings it offers, substantial reductions in noise pollution, and by the requirement to comply with new exhaust emissions regulations.
Stop-and-start technology can deliver, on average, fuel savings of between five and eight per cent.
ACHIEVING MANUFACTURING EXCELLENCE The Group-wide adoption of lean manufacturing processes has yielded much 3 greater savings than anticipated at the start of the year.
Our facility in Ponca City, Oklahoma has made particularly strong progress with inventory down 63%, production volume up 8%, oor space utilisation reduced by 23% and on-time delivery exceeding 99%.
These statistics demonstrate the potential for lean manufacturing across the Tomkins Group.
At the start of 2003, we anticipated cost savings from lean manufacturing to total 18 million.
MAKING VALUE-ENHANCING ACQUISITIONS The acquisition of Stackpole in June 2003 was a notable step in Tomkins strategy 4 of developing a significant presence in the $150 billion global automotive powertrain market.
This market represents the highest value as well as the largest and fastest growing segment of a vehicle.
Stackpole has the technological, engineering and manufacturing expertise necessary to capitalise on the growth in this market.
Combined with the greater financial resources and systems development capability available as part of Tomkins, we will be able to generate even further value for our shareholders.
The outsourced part of the powertrain market is forecast to grow from US$30 billion in 2002 to US$138 billion in 2010 a 21% compound annual growth rate.
EXPANDING OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE Since opening its belt manufacturing facility in 1997, Gates has become the 5 leading player in the Chinese Power Transmission sector, achieving double digit annual growth.
Gates existing Suzhou facility has twice been expanded and is once again operating at full capacity.
In order to service the rapidly expanding industrial and automotive domestic market, Tomkins, together with its local partner, is investing 50 million in a new facility.
Production at the new plant will commence in 2004.
Forecasters predict that China will become the third largest passenger car market after the US and Japan in 2005.

The Committee comprises K J Minton Chairman, N N Broadhurst and J M J Keenan.
There were no changes to the membership of the Committee during the year.
2 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY UNAUDITED INFORMATION The Companys policy on executive remuneration is that the Remuneration Committee and Board should satisfy itself that executives, including executive Directors, are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Groups performance.
The Remuneration Committee has sought to ensure that executive Directors receive a level of remuneration that is appropriate to their scale of responsibility and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain individuals of the necessary calibre.
The only pensionable element of executive Directors remuneration is basic salary.
This policy applies whether or not an executive Director is a member of the Tomkins Retirement Benets Plan or has a personal pension arrangement.
The executive members of the Board review from time-to-time the fees of non-executive Directors, who play no part in determining their own remuneration.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee in the absence of the Chairman and is approved by the Board.
In future, the review of non-executive Directors fees and the Chairmans remuneration will take place every two years.
The Board recognises that one of its key objectives is to grow the value of the business for the benefit of shareholders and that such growth is strongly related, amongst other things, to the degree of entrepreneurial spirit in the Group.
In order to create the necessary entrepreneurial impetus within an organisation, compensation arrangements are required which are similar to those that an owner of a business would seek.
This has led to the adoption of a remuneration policy whereby levels of total remuneration are set which attract, retain and motivate executives, and which are provided through a combination of base salaries at median level or below and annual bonuses that have a direct and proportionate link to total value created for shareholders.
This provides the incentive for executives to act like owners of the business.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that this more closely aligns the interests of shareholders and management whereby executives only receive substantial rewards when they have created high value in the business.
The Companys policy on Directors service contracts is that service contracts and letters of appointment for executive Directors normally provide for notice periods of no longer than twelve months.
On appointment, a longer notice period may apply, but this will reduce over time to the normal twelve months notice period.
3 ANNUAL BONUS INCENTIVE PLAN UNAUDITED INFORMATION The executive Directors and senior executives participate in the Companys Annual Bonus Incentive Plan the Plan.
Each participant in the Plan receives a percentage of bonusable profit of the business for which he or she has responsibility.
Bonusable profit is based on operating profit less a charge for tax and less a charge for invested capital.
The objective of the Plan is to reward the senior executives for increasing the overall value created in the business based on the margin of the after-tax return on invested capital in excess of the weighted average cost of capital.
Accordingly, bonusable profit may increase at a faster rate than operating profit where the margin of the return over the cost of capital increases.
This aligns the interests of management and shareholders.
