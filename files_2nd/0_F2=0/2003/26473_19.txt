The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the holding companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
Turnover Turnover represents the total amount receivable for the provision of goods and services, excluding value added tax.
Turnover is recognised in the period when the service or supply is provided: a annual fees are recognised over the 12 month period to which the fee relates b admission fees are recognised at the time of admission to trading c data, transaction and Exchange charges are recognised in the month in which the data is provided or the transaction is effected.
Intangible assets Intangible assets represent goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, being the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Tangible assets and depreciation a Freehold properties, including related fixed plant, have been revalued by external chartered surveyors and are included in the financial statements at the revalued amounts.
Following the implementation of FRS 15 no revaluations of freehold properties after March 1997 have been made.
Freehold buildings and related fixed plant are depreciated, based on cost or valuation at the beginning of the year plus subsequent additions, over their estimated economic lives.
The economic lives of properties range from 15 to 50 years, the estimated useful lives of fixed plant range from five to 20 years.
b Leasehold properties and improvements are included at cost and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or the economic life of the property.
c Plant and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are mainly in the range from three to five years.
Third party software costs for the development and implementation of systems which enhance the services provided by the Company are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is an average of three years.
d The Group selects its depreciation rates based on expected economic lives, taking into account the expected rate of technological developments, market requirements and expected use of the assets.
The selected rates are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate to the Groups circumstances.
Joint ventures The Groups share of profits, less losses, from joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the Groups share of gross assets and gross liabilities underlying the net equity amount is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Fixed asset investments Shares in the Company held under Employee Share Ownership Plans are stated at cost less amortisation.
The cost of these shares is written down to realisable value over the periods of service in respect of which options and awards are granted.
Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision required for impairment in value.
Provisions A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Operating leases Rental costs for operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account when incurred.
Provision is made in the accounts for lease commitments, less income from sub-letting, for property space which is surplus to business requirements.

Accounting policies continued Pension costs Pension costs for the defined benefit plan are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary.
The accounting cost for providing defined benefit pensions is charged over the period during which the Company benefits from the services of employees.
The cost is calculated so as to produce a substantially level percentage of the current and future pensionable payroll.
Pension costs under the defined contribution plan are charged as incurred.
Further details of the Companys pension schemes and the basis upon which the charge to the profit and loss account is determined are set out in note 22 to the financial statements.
Deferred taxation Full provision is made for the future tax consequences of past transactions and events.
The timing differences are recognised as deferred tax liabilities or assets in the financial statements, measured at expected future tax rates.
No discounting of the deferred tax liabilities or assets is applied.

Pension costs The Company operates one pension plan which includes separate defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The assets of the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are held separately from those of the Company and the funds are managed by Schroder Investment Management Limited and Legal & General Investment Management Limited respectively.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit scheme is non-contributory and provides benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Pension costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Company.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2000 by an independent qualified actuary.
The market value of the plans assets for the scheme was 162m, representing 107 per cent of the value of benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
Defined contribution scheme The Companys defined contribution scheme is now the only scheme open to new employees.
A core contribution of eight per cent of pensionable pay is provided and the Company will match employee contributions up to a maximum of six per cent of pensionable pay.
Pension contributions The contribution rate for the defined benefit scheme is 31.2 per cent of pensionable salaries less 1.1m amortisation of the actuarial surplus at 31 March 2000.
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.
In addition to the normal contributions to the defined benefit scheme, the Company made an additional contribution of 15.0m during the year.
This has therefore been treated as a prepayment in the accounts at 31 March 2003 and will be charged to the profit and loss account in future years over the expected remaining service lives of scheme members.
The level of contributions for future years will be determined following the full actuarial valuation, which will be carried out as at 31 March 2003.

The following information is provided under the disclosure requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The Accounting Standards Board has deferred the full adoption of FRS 17 until implementation of International Accounting Standards in 2005.
The costs for the defined contribution scheme are unchanged by FRS 17 and are as set out above.
Defined benefit valuation The actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2000 was updated at 31 March 2002 and 2003 by an independent qualified actuary to provide the information required by FRS 17.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount of estimated cash flows and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions, as set out below: Actuarial valuation 31 March 2003 31 March 2002 31 March 2000 Inflation assumption 2.5% 2.5% 2.9% Rate of increase in salaries 4.5% 4.5% 4.9% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5% 3.7% 3.7% Discount rate 5.4% 6.0% 5.9% Defined benefit assets and liabilities The fair value of the assets and net position in the defined benefit scheme, with the assumed expected rates of return at 31 March 2003 and 2002, are as follows: 31 March Long-term 31 March Long-term 2003 expected 2002 expected m rate of return m rate of return Equities 35.9 8.00% 40.8 7.75% Bonds 123.1 4.82% 107.3 5.57% Total market value of assets 159.0 148.1 Present value of liabilities 187.0 167.0 Deficit in the plan 28.0 18.9 Related deferred tax asset 8.4 5.7 Net pension liability 19.6 13.2 If the above amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 March 2003 would have been reduced by 29.6m 2002: 12.6m being the deficit of the pension scheme based on assumptions at that date of 19.6m plus the prepaid pension contribution 15.0m less the existing pension provision 0.7m and related deferred tax adjustments.
The plans assets are invested approximately 23 per cent in equities and 77 per cent in bonds at 31 March 2003 and the trustees of the plan intend to move gradually to 100 per cent investment in bonds over the longer term.

Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOP At the Companys AGM in July 2002, shareholders approved a new share option plan.
Under this plan, the maximum value of shares placed under option to an individual is equivalent to 100 per cent of their annual salary.
Full details of the scheme are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 32 to 39.
Under the previous long term incentive scheme comprising the Initial and Annual Share Plans option grants and share awards were made based on approvals prior to the Companys listing in July 2001.
No further option grants or share awards will be made under this scheme apart from the SAYE scheme available to all staff.
The Company established an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the original and the new share scheme and to acquire the Companys shares to meet commitments to employees.
Under both the Initial and Annual Share Plan, share awards have a vesting period of three years and share options become exercisable at 20 per cent per annum over five years.
The SAYE scheme provides for grants of options to employees who enter into a SAYE savings contract.
As provided under UITF 17, no charge is made in the accounts in respect of the SAYE scheme, except where the exercise price on vesting differs from the cost of shares purchased by the Company when the difference is charged to the profit and loss account.
Share awards were granted at nil cost to employees and share options were granted at fair market value or above.
Options under the SAYE scheme were granted at 20 per cent below fair market value.
Costs for the Initial Share Plan are being charged to the profit and loss account over three years from the date of award and share awards under the Annual Bonus Plan in the year to which the awards relate.
At the balance sheet date, 4,870,808 shares 2002: 5,309,967 shares were held by the trust, at an initial cost of 13.1m.
This was funded by an interest free loan from the Company.
At the balance sheet date, the market value of these shares was 13.6m 2002: 23.0m.
