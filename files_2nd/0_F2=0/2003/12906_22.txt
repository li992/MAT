RAC plc Annual report and accounts 2003 63 Notes to the accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2003 32 Pension schemes The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for pension costs, see a and b below.
The relevant transitional disclosures under the new accounting standard, FRS 17 Retirement benefits, are shown in c below.
The UK Accounting Standards Board have delayed full mandatory adoption of FRS17 until 2005, pending proposals from the International Accounting Standards Board.
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for eligible UK employees.
The assets of these schemes are held independently from those of RAC plc, its subsidiaries and joint venture undertakings.
RAC plcs pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread them systematically over employees working lives with the Group.
a RAC 2003 Pension Scheme The RAC 2003 Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme and was formerly called the Lex Service Pension Scheme.
It was renamed on 11 February 2003 following the transfer on 1 January 2002 of the assets and liabilities of the RAC Pension Scheme into the assets and liabilities of the Lex Service Pension Scheme.
The most recent actuarial funding review was as at 31 December 2002 and was based on the position at 5 April 2003 backdated to 31 December 2002.
The funding review was carried out by an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method on an ongoing basis.
The assets were taken at market value at 5 April 2003 and discounted back to 31 December 2002.
The principal assumptions applied in the funding review calculations were: Pre-retirement interest 6.85% p. a. Post-retirement interest 5.85% p. a.
Increases in pensionable salaries 3.70% p. a.
In addition, the funding review included an allowance for discretionary increases in payment of 1.47% p. a. relating to service before 6 April 1997 for former Lex Service Pension Scheme members and an allowance of 2.2% p. a. for former members of the RAC Pension Scheme.
An allowance of 2.2% p. a. is also made for guaranteed pension increases relating to service after 5 April 1997 pensions relating to service after 5 April 1997 are guaranteed to increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% p. a.. At the date of the funding review, the discounted value of the assets of the Scheme was 377 million, which was sufficient to cover 81% of the benefits which had accrued to members, allowing for future expected increases in earnings.
Additional employer contributions were agreed following the last formal valuation to make up the identified shortfall over a period of 12 years.
Since the date of the formal valuation there have been regular updates of the Schemes funding position.
Changes in market conditions have led to a deterioration in the funding position of the Scheme.
Consequently the Group has increased contributions into the pension fund by approximately 2.5 million during 2003 and is expected to increase them by a further 2.5 million in 2004.
The cost of providing pension benefits for the future has increased.
This is primarily because people are living longer, typically drawing a pension for twice as long as they did in the 1960s, which requires a proportionate increase in funding.
In addition, tax changes and lower anticipated investment returns are also increasing the cost of funding the scheme.
To maintain the Scheme, the Group has shared the increase in costs with employees, who have been offered the choice of reduced future benefit levels or increased employee contribution rates from 1 July 2003.
For determining pension cost, the shortfall of the market value of assets over liabilities is spread throughout the expected remaining service lives of employees currently in the scheme.
The total pension cost, including administration costs, of the merged scheme was 21.8 million 2002 18.4 million of which 2.6 million 2002 1.8 million was attributable to joint venture undertakings.
A net prepayment of 3.0 million 2002 2.3 million is included in the balance sheet.
b Other schemes The Group operates a number of smaller defined benefits and defined contribution schemes.
The aggregate total pension cost of these schemes was 1.5 million 2002 1.1 million.

In addition, certain employees may also become eligible for this benefit on retirement.
The number of pensioners entitled to this benefit at 31 December 2003 was 184 2002 193.
The Companys obligation for these benefits was assessed in 2003 by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which disclosed a liability of 4.8 million.
The future health care cost trend rates were 9.0% for three years, falling to 4.0% per annum thereafter.
The discount rate used to determine the liability and cost was 5.75% per annum.
The provision recognised under SSAP 24 was 3.9 million 2002 3.9 million and has been included in creditors falling due after more than one year.
The total cost of providing these benefits in 2003 was 0.3 million.
In 2002 the costs of 0.3 million were charged against the provision.
66 RAC plc Annual report and accounts 2003 34 Contingent liabilities Cross guarantees The Company and certain of its subsidiary undertakings have given cross guarantees in respect of joint bank accounts.
The Company has also given other guarantees in respect of certain bank overdrafts of, and loans to, subsidiary undertakings.
The Companys contingent liabilities in respect of these items amounted to 10.5 million at 31 December 2003 2002 7.7 million.
The consolidated balance sheet includes all of the overdrafts and loans.
End of life vehicles Directive In September 2000, the European Parliament passed Directive 2000 53 EC on end of life vehicles.
As part of this Directive, vehicle manufacturers and professional vehicle importers would be responsible for a significant part of the end of life costs of collecting, disposing and recycling new cars put on the road from 1 July 2002, and from 1 January 2007, for cars put on the road before 2002.
There are a number of uncertainties surrounding the exact form and implementation of the legislation in the UK regarding vehicles registered prior to 1 July 2002.
Although industry estimates have been made, the Directors consider that they believe there is still insufficient information available to them to allow the assessment of the form or value of any obligations that may fall to the Group.
35 Financial instruments a Objective for holding or issuing financial instruments The principal financial instruments held or issued by the Group are as follows: cash: debt, including loan notes and finance lease obligations: forward foreign exchange contracts: interest rate and currency swaps: and certain debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial instrument as set out in FRS 13.
The Groups main objectives for holding cash are to meet day to day working capital and investment needs and to comply with regulatory requirements: forward foreign exchange contracts are held for hedging purposes as are interest rate and currency swaps.
The debtors, creditors and provisions arise directly as part of the Groups operations.
The main risks which the holding and issuing of financial instruments seek to control are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
An explanation of the Boards objectives, policies and strategies for holding and issuing financial instruments is set out in the financial review on page 19. b Liquidity The maturity of all financial liabilities classified according to facility renewal dates is shown in the following table: Debt other Debt other than finance than finance Finance lease Finance lease leases leases obligations obligations Total Total 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m m m Financial liabilities maturing in one year or less or on demand 96.4 44.0 2.3 7.9 98.7 51.9 in more than one year but not more than two years 30.0 43.3 0.4 5.7 30.4 49.0 in more than two years but not more than five years 15.1 156.9 12.6 15.1 169.5 in more than five years 52.3 52.3 52.3 52.3 193.8 296.5 2.7 26.2 196.5 322.7 Undrawn borrowing facilities are available to the Group with the maturities as set out in the following table: 2003 2002 m m Undrawn borrowing facilities expiring in one year or less 5.6 29.1 in more than one year but not more than two years 79.6 9.1 in more than two years 42.2 116.7 127.4 154.9 The conditions precedent to the availability of these facilities are all satisfied at the balance sheet date.
