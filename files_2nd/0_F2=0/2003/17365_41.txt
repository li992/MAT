The Company generally assesses the fair value of identiable intangible assets based on the net present value of expected future cash ows to be derived.

Measurement of an impairment loss is Under UK GAAP, the share consideration for the acquisition of Young & Rubicam Inc was based on fair value of the asset computed using discounted cash ows if the asset is measured by reference to the opening share price on 4 October 2000 of 7.99, which was expected to be held and used.

The relevant measurement date for US GAAP was 12 May 2000, being the date of the announcement of the proposed acquisition and its b Contingent consideration deemed as compensation recommendation to share owners by the respective Boards of directors of WPP Group plc Under UK GAAP, the Group provides for contingent consideration as a liability when it and Young & Rubicam Inc.

This considers the likelihood of payment as probable.

In June 2002, SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities was issued.
SFAS 146 requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities, including restructuring charges, be recognised and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred, and is effective for any such activities initiated after 31 December 2002.

SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances.
SFAS 150 is effective for financial investments entered into or modied after 15 May 2003.
The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have an impact on, or result in additional disclosure in, our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
In December 2003, SFAS 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benets, was revised SFAS 132R.
This statement requires additional disclosures concerning the assets, investment strategy, measurement dates, obligations, cash ows, and net periodic benefit costs of dened benefit schemes.
The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 132R for its UK schemes, the disclosure requirements with respect to our non-UK schemes, as well as the disclosure of expected 10 year future benefit payments, are effective beginning with scal years ending after 15 June 2004.
In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 03-01, The Meaning of OtherThan-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments EITF 03-01.
EITF 03-01 provides a step model to determine whether an investment within the scope of the Issue is impaired and if an impairment is other-than-temporary.
In addition, it requires that investors provide certain disclosures for cost method investments and, if applicable, other information related specically to cost method investments, such as the aggregate carrying amount of cost method investments, the aggregate amount of cost method investments that the investor did not evaluate for impairment because an impairment indicator was not present, and the situations under which the fair value of a cost method investment is not estimated.
The disclosures related to cost method investments should not be aggregated with other types of investments.
The EITF 03-01 impairment model shall be applied prospectively to all current and future affected investments, effective in reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2004.
The disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods for scal years ending after 15 June 2004.
