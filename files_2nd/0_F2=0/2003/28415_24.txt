NOTES ON THE ACHIEVED PROFITS BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION OF RESULTS The achieved profits basis results include the results of the Groups long-term business operations on the achieved profits basis.
These results are combined with the statutory basis results of the Groups other operations including banking, unit trusts, mutual funds and other non-insurance investment management business.
The achieved profits basis results for long-term business for 2003 and 2002 have been prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI in December 2001 Supplementary Reporting for Long-Term Insurance Business the Achieved Profits Method.
The information is supplementary to the financial statements on pages 56 to 96.
METHODOLOGY The achieved profits basis results incorporate best estimate assumptions of future rates of investment return, proprietors spread in the case of Jackson National Life, policy discontinuances, mortality, expenses, expense inflation, taxation, bonus rates, surrender and paid up bases, and statutory valuation bases.
In adopting these assumptions, account has been taken of recent experience and general economic conditions, together with inherent uncertainty.
It has been assumed that the bases and rates of taxation, both direct and indirect, will not change materially in the countries in which the Group operates.
The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the UK with-profits business has been based on the present level of 10%.
Future bonus rates have been set at levels which would fully utilise the assets of the with-profits fund over the lifetime of the business in force.
In the UK, Department of Work and Pensions rebate business has been treated as single premium business.
ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS Under the ABI guidance, for most countries, the basis for setting long-term expected rates of returns on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to period end rates of return on fixed interest securities.
This active basis of assumption setting has been applied in preparing the results of all the Groups UK, US and European long-term business operations.
For the Groups Asian operations, the active basis is appropriate for business written in Japan, Korea and US dollar denominated business written in Hong Kong.
An exception to this general rule is that for countries where long-term fixed interest markets are underdeveloped, investment return assumptions and risk discount rates should be based on an assessment of longer-term economic conditions.
Except for the countries listed above, this basis is appropriate for the Groups Asian operations.
The profit and loss account charge in respect of the effect of changes in economic assumptions, which is shown as an item excluded from operating profit, as shown in note 14, reflects the effect on shareholders funds at the start of the reporting period.
The key economic assumptions are described below: 2003 2002 UK and Europe Insurance Operations Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: UK equities 7.3% 7.0% Overseas equities 6.6% to 7.9% 7.0% to 7.8% Property 6.6% 6.75% Gilts 4.8% 4.5% Corporate bonds 5.8% 5.5% Assets of PAC with-profits fund applying the rates listed above to the investments held by the fund 6.8% 6.6% Expected long-term rate of inflation 3.1% 2.5% Post-tax expected long-term nominal rate of return: Pension business where no tax applies 6.8% 6.6% Life business 5.9% 5.7% Risk margin included within the risk discount rate 2.6% 2.6% i Risk discount rate 7.4% 7.1% US Operations Jackson National Life Expected long-term spread between earned rate and rate credited to policyholders for single premium deferred annuity business 1.75% 1.75% US 10 year treasury bond rate at end of year 4.3% 3.9% Risk margin included within the risk discount rate 3.1% 3.1% i Risk discount rate 7.4% 7.0% ii Prudential Asia Weighted pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return 7.4% 7.1% Weighted expected long-term rate of inflation 3.4% 3.0% i Weighted risk discount rate 10.4% 9.6% i For all operations, a discount rate is applied to post-tax cash flows to determine post-tax results.
For most operations, these results are then grossed up for the effective rate of tax to derive the pre-tax results.
For Jackson National Life, pre-tax results are determined by applying the risk discount rate to pre-tax cash flows adjusted for the impact of capital charges.
ii The Prudential Asia economic assumptions shown above have been determined by weighting each countrys economic assumptions by reference to the achieved profits basis operating results for new business written in the relevant year.
INVESTMENT RETURN i Profit before tax With the exception of fixed interest investments held by Jackson National Life, investment gains and losses during the period to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included in the profit for the year and shareholders funds as they arise.
In the case of Jackson National Life, it is assumed that fixed income investments will normally be held until maturity.
Therefore unrealised gains and losses on these securities are not reflected in either the achieved profits or statutory basis results and, except on realisation or impairment of investments, only income received and the amortisation of the difference between cost and maturity values are recognised to the extent attributable to shareholders.
ii Operating profit Investment returns, including investment gains, in respect of long-term insurance business are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rate of return.
For the purposes of calculating investment return to be recognised in operating results of UK operations, where equity holdings are a significant proportion of investment portfolios, values of assets at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of short-term market volatility.
For the purposes of determining the long-term returns, realised gains and losses arising including impairment losses on debt securities of Jackson National Life have been averaged over five years and combined with actual interest income and dividends.
For equity-related investments of Jackson National Life, a long-term rate of return of 7.75% has been assumed.
This has been applied to the monthly average carrying value of such investments after excluding the estimated effect of short-term market movements.
SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS INFORMATION The Groups supplemental measure of its results and reconciliation of achieved profits basis operating profit based on long-term investment returns before amortisation of goodwill to achieved profits basis profit on ordinary activities, including the related basic earnings per share amounts, are as follows: Basic Before Minority earnings ii tax Tax Post-tax interests Net per share m m m m m Pence 2003 Based on operating profit after tax and minority interests before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items 794 273 521 6 527 26.4p Adjustment for amortisation of goodwill 98 98 98 4.9 p Adjustment from post-tax long-term investment returns to post-tax actual investment returns after related i minority interests 682 212 470 4 466 23.3p Effect of changes in economic assumptions 540 130 410 410 20.5 p Based on profit for the financial year after minority interests 838 355 483 2 485 24.3p 2002 Based on operating profit after tax and minority interests before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items 1,133 286 847 4 851 42.8p Adjustment for amortisation of goodwill 98 98 98 4.9 p Adjustment from post-tax long-term investment returns to post-tax actual investment returns after related i minority interests 1,406 447 959 5 954 48.0 p Effect of changes in economic assumptions 467 181 286 286 14.4 p Profit on sale of UK general business operations 355 13 342 342 17.2p Based on loss for the financial year after minority interests 483 329 154 9 145 7.3 p i The adjustment from post-tax long-term returns to post-tax actual investment returns includes investment returns that are attributable to external equity investors in two investment funds managed by PPM America.
These two funds are consolidated as quasi-subsidiaries but, except to the extent of Prudential Group participation in the funds, they have no net impact on pre-tax or post-tax operating profit.
Total profit, before and after tax, incorporating the adjustment from long-term to actual investment returns includes gains of 4m losses of 5m attributable to the minority interests in these funds.
ii The average number of shares for 2003 is 1,996m 1,988m.

COST OF CAPITAL A charge is deducted from the annual result and the balance sheet value for the cost of capital supporting solvency requirements for the Groups long-term business.
This cost is the difference between the nominal value of solvency capital and the present value, at risk discount rates, of the projected release of this capital and investment earnings on the capital.
The annual result is impacted by the movement in this cost from year to year which comprises a charge against new business profit with a partial offset for the release of capital requirements for business in-force.
Where solvency capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets in the fund is already discounted to reflect its release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of solvency capital.
However, where business is funded directly by shareholders, principally at Jackson National Life, the solvency capital requires adjustments to reflect the cost of that capital.
In determining the cost of capital of Jackson National Life, it has been assumed that an amount equal to 200% of the risk based capital required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners at the Company Action Level must be retained.
The impact of the related capital charge is to reduce Jackson National Lifes result by 19m 24m and its shareholders funds by 164m 138m.
PENSION COSTS The impact of pension costs on the achieved profits basis results of long-term business has been determined in the context of the methodology described in note 2.
Accordingly, for long-term business, the achieved profits basis value of new business written in the reporting period and the value of in-force business at the balance sheet date have been determined after incorporating projections of attributable pension costs into the estimates of future cash flows for the contracts concerned.
Experience variances for expenses include any difference between the actual and assumed contributions to defined benefit pension schemes.
The achieved profits basis results and shareholders funds for long-term business are, therefore, not affected by whether or not the Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits in preparing its achieved profits basis results.
On the achieved profits basis of reporting, the impact of adoption of FRS 17 for long-term business would be limited to: i Balance sheet recognition of the FRS 17 basis net pensions scheme asset or liability: ii For that element of the net pensions scheme asset or liability that is attributable to the PAC with-profits fund, an adjustment of the Group fund for future appropriations by an equal but opposite amount: and iii For shareholder financed long-term business, an adjustment of the composition of achieved profits basis shareholders funds between the components of the modified statutory basis shareholders funds and additional shareholders reserves reflecting the additional shareholders interest recognised on the achieved profits basis.
As explained in note 1, the achieved profits basis results include statutory basis results for operations other than those conducting long-term business.
In preparing results for these operations the Group has continued to apply SSAP 24.
Further details are shown in note 17 on pages 82 to 84 of the Group's financial statements.
OPERATING PROFIT FROM NEW BUSINESS 2003 2002 Pre-tax Tax Post-tax Pre-tax Tax Post-tax m m m m m m UK and Europe Insurance Operations 166 50 116 233 69 164 i Jackson National Life 148 72 76 234 116 118 Prudential Asia 291 80 211 307 84 223 Total 605 202 403 774 269 505 i Jackson National Life net of tax profit: Before capital charge 95 142 Capital charge note 6 19 24 After capital charge 76 118 In determining the achieved profits basis value of new business written in the year the policies incept, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing annual and single premium business as set out on page 74.
OPERATING PROFIT FROM BUSINESS IN-FORCE Operating profits from new business are measured using the revised economic assumptions shown in note 3 and after applying any revised operating assumptions.
The profit and loss account impact for revised operating assumptions is shown below: 2003 2002 m m UK and Europe Insurance Operations i Unwind of discount 343 367 ii Cost of strengthened persistency assumption 50 47 ii Other items 100 37 193 283 Jackson National Life Unwind of discount 145 156 Return on surplus assets over target surplus 33 41 iii Averaged realised losses on bonds in excess of long-term default assumption note 10 66 59 Experience variances against current assumptions: iii iv Spread 17 72 Persistency 10 8 Expenses 8 1 Loss from strengthening of operating assumptions 21 54 Other 5 4 71 17 Prudential Asia Unwind of discount 115 95 Profit arising from reorganisation of long-term funds 59 v Change in operating assumptions 27 42 Other items and experience variances 1 13 87 209 Total 351 509 i The unwind of discount for UK and Europe Insurance Operations represents the unwind of discount on the value of in-force business at the beginning of the year adjusted for the effect of current year assumption changes, the expected return on smoothed surplus assets retained within the main with-profits fund see note 13, and the expected return on shareholders assets held in other UK and Europe long-term business operations.
Surplus assets retained within the main with-profits fund are smoothed for this purpose to remove the effects of short-term investment volatility.
ii The 50m cost of strengthened persistency assumption for 2003 relates to personal pension policies sold by the now discontinued direct salesforce.
The 100m charge for other items for 2003 includes a 35m adverse experience variance for persistency which is not expected to recur: a 29m restructuring charge: an adverse annuitant mortality assumption change of 18m: a strengthening of renewal expense assumptions of 29m: other positive assumption changes of 30m: and 19m of other negative items and experience variances.
For 2002, the 37m for other items includes 16m of UK re-engineering costs.
iii The presentation of Jackson National Life's operating profit has been revised from that applied in the 2002 Annual Report so as to be consistent with the basis introduced for Interim 2003 reporting.
The charge for average realised losses shown above is as compared to the long-term default assumption for fixed income securities, which is now presented as part of the determination of spread variance.
In previous periods the experience variance for spread was presented before deduction of the default assumption for fixed income securities.
The charge for the default assumption is calculated using a weighted risk margin reserve RMR approach.
An RMR charge is individually assigned to asset classes based on credit ratings and, where necessary, credit analysis.
This is then weighted by reference to the carrying value of the investments.
This revised presentation has no impact on operating profit.
The spread variance on the current and previous bases of presentation is set out below: 2003 2002 m m Using basis applied in 2002 Annual Report 54 2 Less: Long-term default assumption 71 74 As reported above 17 72 iv The spread variance shown above has been determined after including long-term returns on equity based investments.
This treatment is consistent with the inclusion of long-term investment returns within operating profit.
Short-term fluctuations in investment returns, including those for equity based investments, are excluded from operating profit but included within the total profit or loss for the reporting period.
An analysis of the short-term fluctuations in investment returns is shown in note 10. v The 27m charge in 2003 for changes to operating assumptions primarily reflects expense assumption changes in Japan.
The 2002 credit of 42m arose from revisions to mortality assumptions.

SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN INVESTMENT RETURNS 2003 2002 m m Long-term business: i UK and Europe Insurance Operations 531 1,021 ii Jackson National Life 132 440 v Prudential Asia 1 66 Share of investment return of funds managed by PPM America that are consolidated into Group results but attributable to external investors note 5 4 5 Other operations 14 6 Total 682 1,406 i Short-term fluctuations in investment returns represent for UK and Europe Insurance Operations the difference between actual investment returns attributable to shareholders on the achieved profits basis and the expected returns as described in note 3.
The 531m of positive fluctuations in 2003 reflect the difference between the PAC with-profits fund actual investment return of 16.5% and the long-term assumed rate of 6.8%.
ii Short-term fluctuations for Jackson National Life comprise: 2003 2002 m m iii Actual investment returns on investments less long-term returns included within operating profit 96 295 Investment return related gain loss due primarily to changed expectation of profitability on variable annuity business arising from current year equity returns 36 145 132 440 This adjustment arises due to market returns for 2003 and 2002 being higher lower than the assumed long-term rate of return.
This gives rise to higher lower than expected year-end values of variable annuity assets under management with a resulting effect on the projected value of future account values, and hence future profitability.
iii Jackson National Life Actual investment returns on investments less long-term returns comprises: 2003 2002 m m iv Actual less averaged realised gains and losses including impairments for fixed income securities 98 156 Actual less long-term return on equity based investments 0 128 Investment depreciation on preference shares 2 11 96 295 iv Jackson National Life Actual less averaged realised gains and losses including impairments for fixed income securities m US$m equivalent Gains losses arising in years 1999 to 2003 1999 3 2000 90 2001 532 2002 435 2003 65 39 Five year total 1,119 684 Five year average included in operating result 224 137 Representing: Long-term default assumption 116 71 Averaged losses in excess of the long-term default assumption note 9 108 66 224 137 Actual less averaged losses excluded from operating result but included in profit before tax 159 98 Exchange rate 1.64 Averaged realised gains differ from those reported on the statutory basis for the impact of amortisation of policy acquisition costs attributable to realised gains and losses.
These have been included in the statutory basis gains averaging calculation for the years 1999 to 2003.
On the achieved profits basis deferred acquisition costs do not feature as part of the methodology.
Accordingly the realised gains and losses included in the averaging process are exclusive of the amortisation of policy acquisition costs attributable to realised gains and losses.
v Short-term fluctuations for Prudential Asia for 2002 of 66m primarily reflect bond value movements.
EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS The losses on changes in economic assumptions included within the profit loss on ordinary activities before tax arise as follows: 2003 2002 m m i UK and Europe Insurance Operations 122 233 ii Jackson National Life 263 76 iii Prudential Asia 155 158 Total 540 467 i The 122m charge for 2003 for UK and Europe Insurance Operations reflects increases in the risk discount rate of 0.3% and in the investment return assumption of 0.2% and other consequential impacts of an economic nature on the modelled emergence of the shareholders share of cost of bonus.
ii The 263m charge for 2003 for Jackson National Life primarily reflects the reductions in the projected fund earned and crediting rates on in-force business which result in lower projected policyholder liabilities on which future spread will be earned, together with increases in the risk discount and inflation rates.
iii The 155m charge for 2003 for Prudential Asia reflects the net impact of revisions to the underlying long-term investment return assumptions and discount rate, combined with the impact of the introduction of a risk-based capital regime by the Taiwanese regulators.
TAXATION CHARGE The profit for the year is in most cases calculated initially at the post-tax level.
The post-tax profit is then grossed up for presentation purposes at the effective rates of tax applicable to the countries and periods concerned.
For Jackson National Life the profit is calculated at the pre-tax level and the effective tax rate is the rate expected to be applicable on average over the remaining lifetimes of the policies.
The tax charge comprises: 2003 2002 m m Tax charge on operating profit Long-term business: UK and Europe Insurance Operations 133 166 Jackson National Life 67 49 i Prudential Asia 121 123 321 338 Other operations 48 52 Total tax on operating profit 273 286 Tax on items not included in operating profit Tax charge credit on short-term fluctuations in investment returns 212 447 Tax credit on effect of changes in economic assumptions 130 181 Tax charge on profit on disposal of UK general business operations 13 Total tax charge credit on items not included in operating profit 82 615 Tax charge credit on profit loss on ordinary activities including tax on actual investment returns 355 329 i Including tax relief on development expenses.

This represents a pre-tax loss of 540m less related tax credit of 130m as analysed by business operation in note 14 and an adjustment for exchange losses to reflect rates at 31 December 2002 of 4m.
ii Estimated impact on 2003 and 2002 results based on alternative assumptions The key assumptions that affect the Groups results are economic, in particular expected rates of investment return and risk discount rates.
The sensitivities of the 2003 and 2002 results to changes in these assumptions are set out below: 2003 2002 m m Pre-tax operating profit from new business for the year Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: Increase in rates of 1% 75 103 Decrease in rates of 1% 81 100 Risk discount rates: Increase in rates of 1% 74 85 Decrease in rates of 1% 87 102 Shareholders funds at the year end Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: Increase in rates of 1% 897 750 Decrease in rates of 1% 930 774 Risk discount rates: Increase in rates of 1% 488 417 Decrease in rates of 1% 572 474 16.
