Following the sale of the Whitbread Beer Company there remained a continuing activity within the Beer segment.
This was as a result of the terms of the sale of the Whitbread Beer Company to Interbrew which included arrangements for Whitbread to retain the people and the necessary production capacity to ensure compliance with its obligations for the remaining period of the Heineken and Murphy licences.

7 Pensions The defined benefit final salary section of the principal group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, which was available to eligible UK full-time and part-time employees, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
There was also a defined contribution scheme available to employees which was also closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Both schemes are funded and contributions by both employees and group companies are held in externally invested trusteeadministered funds.
Members of these schemes are contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
A replacement, contracted-in, defined contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with effect from 1 April 2002.
The total non-government pension cost for the group, including directors, is analysed below: 2002 3 2001 2 m m Funded schemes 10.5 16.0 Unfunded scheme 0.5 0.4 Overseas schemes.
0.1 11.0 16.5 The pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit credit valuation basis.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The pension cost for the year has been based on the latest actuarial valuation which was carried out as at 31 March 2002.
The assumptions were derived from market yields.
Separate assumptions were made for the discount rate used to value liabilities and the return expected on the assets.
The value of the assets was calculated as an average of the market values over the past three years.
For the 1999 valuation, the assumptions reflected the actuaries' expectations for the long term rather than conditions at the valuation date.
The rate used to discount the liabilities was the same as the assumed investment return.
The value placed on the assets was equal to the discounted value of expected future investment income.
The change in valuation approach has not significantly affected the total pension cost charged for 2002 3.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 4.9% per annum above inflation, that the discount rate would be 3.4% per annum above inflation until retirement and 2.9% per annum above inflation thereafter, that the annual increase in pensionable salaries including promotional increases would be 2.0% above inflation and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would average 0.1% per annum below inflation.
For 2002 3, the regular cost was derived as the service cost calculated using the real discount rates set out above less an adjustment reflecting the excess of the expected return on the assets over interest on the liabilities.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is eight years.
page 52 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2002 3 Notes to the accounts 7 Pensions continued Since the valuation date, the value of the assets of the Fund has fallen in line with investment markets generally.
If the value of investments does not recover, the pension cost is likely to rise following the next valuation of the Fund due as at 31 March 2005.
The pension prepayment included in debtors note 20 represents funding paid to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in excess of the pension cost, plus interest thereon.
The board announced in April 2003 that the company had signed an agreement with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited.
Under that agreement, the company has undertaken to fund the pension scheme for a period of up to 15 years and given undertakings to the trustees similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements.
As a consequence of this agreement, payments will be made into the fund for each of the next three years at a rate of 15m above the anticipated SSAP 24 charge.
There will be no change to the profit and loss account as a consequence of this agreement for each of the three financial years until the triennial valuation in March 2005.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits will change fundamentally the calculation and reporting of the cost of retirement benefits.
