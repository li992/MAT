Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term borrowings: The book value approximates to fair value either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of investments is reset after periods not greater than six months.
Derivatives: The fair value of derivatives is the estimated amount, based on current market rates, which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
Hedges of future transactions As described in the Finance Directors review on pages 22 to 27 the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest swaps Currency exposures on future forecast sales using forward foreign currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options Commodity price risk using jet fuel swaps Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are dealt with as outlined in the accounting policies on pages 53 and 54.

In the above table the gures up to June 23, 2003 relate to shares in Rolls-Royce plc.
Subsequent movements relate to shares in Rolls-Royce Group plc.
Rolls-Royce Group plc was incorporated on March 21, 2003 with an authorised share capital of 1,750m and issued shares as follows: 2 ordinary shares of 70 pence 50,000 redeemable preference shares of 1 were issued to Shield Trust Limited On June 23, 2003, as part of the scheme of arrangement noted above, a further 1,630,996,508 ordinary shares of 70 pence were issued, whereby the Company was interposed as the new holding company of the Rolls-Royce Group.
As required by Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 Merger Relief, no share premium was recognised.
Additionally the entire issued redeemable preference share capital was redeemed at par, and the two ordinary shares cancelled.
On June 25, 2003 the share capital of Rolls-Royce Group plc was reduced by reducing the nominal value of the ordinary shares from 70 pence to 20 pence as sanctioned by the High Court.
As a result 816m was added to the profit and loss account reserve for both the Company and the Group.
For the Company this amount is distributable.
Certain special rights, set out in the Companys Articles of Association, attach to the special rights redeemable preference share special share issued to HM Government.
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, the special share may be redeemed by the Treasury Solicitor at par at any time.
The special share confers no rights to dividends or to vote at general meetings but in the event of a winding-up it shall be repaid at its nominal value in priority to any other shares.
After the scheme of arrangement became effective, the special share was redeemed and a new special share in Rolls-Royce Group plc issued.
70 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 25 Share capital continued As a result of the scheme of arrangement, holders of options over ordinary shares in Rolls-Royce plc under the sharesave schemes and the executive option schemes were permitted to exchange their options for options over an equivalent number of ordinary shares in Rolls-Royce Group plc.
Option holders in the sharesave schemes were alternatively entitled to exercise their options for a period of six months from the scheme date.
Under the terms of the sharesave schemes, the Board may grant options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company each year to those employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE contract for a period of either three, five or seven years.
Employees in 28 countries participate in sharesave schemes through arrangements broadly comparable to the UK scheme.

These can involve, inter alia, guaranteeing nancing for customers, guaranteeing a proportion of the values of both engine and airframe, entering into leasing transactions, commitments to purchase aircraft and in certain circumstances could involve the Group assuming certain of its customers entitlements and related borrowing or cash ow obligations until the value of the security can be realised.
At the date these accounts are approved, the directors regard the possibility that there will be any significant loss arising from these contingencies, which cover a number of customers over a long period of time, as remote.
In determining this, and the values below, the directors have taken account of advice, principally from Airclaims Limited, professional aircraft appraisers, who base their calculations on a current and future fair market value basis assuming an arms-length transaction between a willing seller and a willing buyer.
At December 31, 2003, the total gross contingent liabilities relating to nancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft less insurance arrangements and relevant provisions amounted to 1,090m 2002 1,093m, of which 39m 2002 35m related to sales finance support to joint ventures.
Taking into account the net realisable value of the relevant security, the net contingent liabilities in respect of nancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft amounted to 184m 2002 186m.
Sensitivity calculations are complex, but, for example, if the value of the relevant security was reduced by 20%, a net contingent liability of approximately 262m 2002 251m would result.
There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future and the related nancing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Company and some of its subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group or Company.
In addition to the above, the Company has provided guarantees in respect of borrowings of subsidiary undertakings as shown in notes 18 and 20.
29 Related party transactions Joint ventures In the course of normal operations, the Group has contracted on an arms-length basis with joint ventures.
The aggregated transactions which are considered to be material and which have not been disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements are summarised below: 2003 2002 m m Other income 9 20 Purchases of goods and services from joint ventures 682 482 73 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Post-retirement benets Pensions The Groups pension schemes are mainly of the dened benefit type and the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The pension cost relating to the UK schemes is assessed in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, based on the advice of independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuations of the principal schemes were as at March 31, 2001 for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme, April 5, 2001 for the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme, and March 31, 2003 for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund.
The principal assumptions used were that in the long term the average returns on investments would be between 2.0% and 2.3% per annum higher than the average increase in pay and between 3.6% and 4.0% per annum higher than the average increase in pensions.
Assets were valued on a market related basis.
The pension cost relating to overseas schemes is calculated in accordance with local best practice and regulations.
The total pension cost for the Group was 95m 2002 64m of which 23m 2002 21m relates to overseas schemes.
The aggregate of the market values of the UK schemes at the dates of the latest actuarial valuations was 3,885m.
The actuarial value of the assets of the principal schemes represented respectively 92% for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund, 129% for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme and 126% for the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme of the value of the projected accrued liabilities.
The difference between the value of the assets and the value of the projected accrued liabilities after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pension increases is being amortised over periods of between 8.5 and 12 years, being the average expected remaining service lives of the pensionable employees.
Prepayments of 239m 2002 204m are included in debtors and accruals of 29m 2002 30m are included in provisions for liabilities and charges, being the differences between the accumulated amounts paid into the pension funds and the accumulated pension costs.
Post-retirement benets other than pensions In the USA, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benets for retired employees.
In the USA, 492 retired employees currently benefit from these provisions and it is estimated that 4,724 current employees will be eligible on retirement.
The cost of post-retirement benets other than pensions for the Group was 17m 2002 19m.
Provisions for the benefit obligations at December 31, 2003 amounted to 119m 2002 120m and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
There were no plan assets at either December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002.
The future costs of benets are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries and are based on a weighted average discount rate of 6.3% and a weighted average assumed healthcare costs trend rate of 8% grading down to 5% over seven years.
