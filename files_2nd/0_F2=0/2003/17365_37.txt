These reviews were carried out using a 10 year projection Net cash inow 119.7 213.9 499.0 period as the Group believes that this longer period is more appropriate to assess the carrying value of these global networks given current economic volatility.
The projections for the initial three years were derived from existing budgets and three year plans and form the base period.
Projections for the remaining seven years assume an annual 4.4% growth in revenues and an improvement in operating margins to 17% by 2007.
At the end of the 10 year period growth is assumed to be in line with nominal GDP.
