At present, it is not anticipated that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share of 51.53 pence is calculated on the profit of 298.4 million accruing to ordinary share capital and on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 579.1 million.
The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue by 4.6 million and to reduce basic earnings per share to 51.12 pence.
The earnings per share before goodwill amortisation of 56.69 pence is calculated on the profit of 328.3 million accruing to ordinary share capital.

Other provisions include, for property, 12.7 million, environmental and legal liabilities including asbestos related litigation, 24.3 million and deferred taxation, 22.7 million.
The asbestos related litigation is fully covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in Other debtors note 13 in line with FRS 12 Provisions, contingencies and contingent assets.
The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis.
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.

Valuers are currently undertaking a detailed exercise to assess the fair value of properties, the completion of their exercise may lead to revisions to the fair values at which the properties were acquired.
The accounting policy adjustment to tangible fixed assets reflects the capitalisation of certain finance leases not treated as such in the local books.
The book value of stocks has been adjusted to write down slow moving and obsolete stocks to their estimated net realisable amount in accordance with Group accounting policy, this adjustment was the best estimate currently available and may be revised once additional information is available.
Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some other judgmental areas.

Interest receipts and payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities are determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
The Group has entered into the following interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements with the following net effect as at 31 July 2003: Amount Expiry date Wolseley receives Wolseley pays US$100 million October 2003 3 month LIBOR 3.625% to 3.64% US$100 million November 2003 3 month LIBOR 3.709% to 3.72% EUR30 million February 2004 3 month EURIBOR 4.185% US$125 million September 2005 6 month LIBOR 2.0375% to 2.06% US$50 million September 2006 6 month LIBOR 2.64% to 2.665% EUR50 million August 2005 6 month EURIBOR 2.53% to 2.535% EUR75 million October 2005 6 month EURIBOR 2.575% to 2.6075% EUR100 million October 2006 6 month EURIBOR 2.90% to 2.915% 32.
Financial instruments The Group held the following categories of financial instruments as at 31 July 2003: Book value Fair value m m Financial instruments held to fund the Groups operations Short-term borrowings 207.0 207.0 Loans and other borrowings payable after one year 842.5 842.5 Cash and deposits 215.9 215.9 Construction loans receivable 176.2 176.2 Construction loans payable 176.1 176.1 Current asset investments 6.9 6.9 Financial instruments held to manage the Groups interest rate and currency profile Interest rate swaps 0.8 Short-term currency swaps 0.2 For the purpose of the previous table, the fair values of short-term borrowings, cash and deposits, construction loans payable and current asset investments, approximate book value due to their short maturities.
The loans and other borrowings payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR.
Thus the fair value of these instruments as at 31 July 2003 also approximates to their book value.
The fair value of construction loans receivable approximates to book value as the interest rates attaching to these loans reflect a market risk premium.
Sterling cash and deposits are utilised to reduce currency borrowings through the use of short-term currency swaps.

Pensions and other post retirement benefits United Kingdom The principal plan operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees of 5% of earnings with the balance being paid by Group companies.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
An independent actuarial valuation was last carried out on 1 May 2001.
On that date the market value of the plans assets was 350.5 million.
The market value of the assets was 105% of accrued benefits, after allowing for increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The normal cost to the Company was 14.4% of pensionable earnings.
The financial assumptions used were based on gilt and bond yields as at the valuation date.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were an investment return of 6.5% per annum before retirement and an investment return of 5.5% per annum after retirement, future salary increases of 5% or 6% per annum and increases to pensions in payment of 2.5% per annum.
The total charge to the profit and loss account for UK companies was 12.3 million 2002: 9.4 million.
North America The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, details of which are set out below.
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
Defined contribution plans Defined contribution plans are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2003 the cost of defined contribution plans charged to the profit and loss account was 10.7 million 2002: 9.9 million.
Defined benefit plans Defined benefit plans are operated by three US subsidiary undertakings and Wolseley Canada.
Two of the US plans and the Canadian plan are funded: two plans are closed to new entrants.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan.
The remaining plans provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
The independent actuaries have reported on the assets and liabilities of the plans at 31 July 2002.
The principal actuarial assumptions were based upon investment returns of 7%-7.5% and future salary increases of 4%.
The obligations are discounted at 7%.
The fair value of the assets of the funded plans amounted to 44.0 million.
The market value of the assets was 81.3% of the accrued benefits.
Surpluses and deficits revealed by the valuation are being amortised over the expected remaining service lives of members.
The total profit and loss account charge for North American schemes was 2.7 million 2002: 3.2 million.
Other territories Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Full provision is made for such liabilities in these accounts.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
The cost of other defined contribution and defined benefit schemes charged to the profit and loss account was 2.7 million 2002: 2.7 million.
Post retirement health care There are no material obligations to provide post retirement health care benefits.
FRS 17 retirement benefits The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures with respect to the UK scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 May 2001 and updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 July 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 July 2003.
Non-UK schemes have been aggregated and weighted averages applied.
