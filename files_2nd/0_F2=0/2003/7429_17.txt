Concurrent with the Companys otation on the London Stock Exchange on 15 May 2002 the Company repaid its existing bank facilities and drew down on a new 275 million bank term debt facility and a 150 million bank revolving credit facility.
In addition, the Companys Senior Subordinated Notes were repaid from the proceeds of the otation.

Senior Facility Agreement The Senior Facility Agreement existing at 27 April 2002 was repaid on otation of the Company on the London Stock Exchange on 15 May 2002.
A new syndicated bank Senior Facility Agreement was entered into, consisting of a 275 million term loan facility and a 150 million revolving credit facility.
The committed facilities under these agreements are as set out below.
Total available at 26 April 27 April 2003 2002 Facility million million Sterling amortising term loan facility 250.0 Sterling amortising term loan facilities 105.8 US dollar amortising term loan facilities 136.2 Multi currency revolving credit facility 150.0 150.0 Total 400.0 392.0 Deferred nancing fees totalling 9.7 million relating to the previous Senior Facility Agreement have been charged to the profit and loss account as an exceptional finance cost in the year ended 26 April 2003.
Further fees totalling 8.4 million relating to the arrangement of the new Senior Facility Agreement have been deferred and are being amortised over the five year term of the Senior Facility Agreement.
Interest on advances under the new Senior Facility Agreement was payable during the financial year ended 26 April 2003 at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5%.
Since the year end, from 23 May 2003, the margin has reduced to 0.875%.
Borrowings continued Senior Subordinated Notes On 22 May 1998 the Company issued Senior Subordinated Notes the Notes totalling 211,687,117.
The Notes 7 1 comprised 135,000,000 10 8% sterling denominated Notes the Sterling Notes and US$125,000,000 104% US dollar denominated Notes the US dollar Notes both of which were due to mature in 2008.
The proceeds of the otation were used to repay the Notes, giving rise to an exceptional interest charge of 25.6 million, which has been charged to the profit and loss account in the 52 weeks ended 26 April 2003.
Security The borrowings under the new Senior Facility Agreement are secured by the Guarantors that comprise HMV Group plc and any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company who accede to the new Senior Facility Agreement as guarantors.
As a condition of the Agreement, the aggregate gross assets, revenue and profit before interest and tax of the Guarantors must comprise not less than 75% of the total gross assets, revenue and profit before tax and interest of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
The guarantors currently comprise HMV Group plc, HMV Music Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Limited, HMV IP Limited and HMV UK Limited.
The Company has granted security comprising first ranking xed and oating charges over all the assets and undertakings of the guarantors.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and crossguaranteed.
Such pooling and offset arrangements are reected in the Group balance sheet as appropriate.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Objectives, policies and strategies for the role of derivatives and the other financial instruments The Group nances itself through cash generated by operations and bank borrowings.
The financial instruments of the Group comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, derivatives and various items including trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group has committed bank facilities comprising a sterling denominated term loan of 250 million and a revolving credit facility of 150 million, which provides funding for its operations in the UK and indirectly to its operations in other territories, through letter of credit provisions.
The Group may also provide funds to overseas subsidiaries by lending intra-Group on commercial terms, or by issuing a guarantee in respect of local bank borrowings.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions and has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
The Groups use of derivatives is to modify the currency exposure of its debt to match underlying cash ow and assets, to limit borrowing costs and to hedge product purchases.
In all cases underlying exposures justify the use of derivatives.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed, described below, are managed by Treasury using policies approved by the Board.
Liquidity risk The Group has committed bank facilities comprising a term loan of 250 million and a revolving credit facility of 150 million, which together with cash on deposit provides sufficient funding for the Groups operations.
The adequacy of the funding arrangements is reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risks The Groups bank term debt carries a variable rate of interest linked to prevailing interest rates.
In order to mitigate the risk of a rise in interest rates, the Group has entered into several interest rate derivative contracts such that 60% of the term debt carries a xed rate of interest.
The position is reviewed regularly.
Counterparty risk Treasury deposits any cash balances that arise with counterparties that have a strong credit rating, with an agreed limit for each counterparty, so as to limit the risk of loss arising from a failure.
Counterparties include AAA-rated Liquidity funds, and various banks.
com Notes to the financial statements continued 19.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Foreign exchange risk The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of imports where volumes are significant.
However, the Groups operating businesses generally source the majority of their product from suppliers within their country of operation and so the foreign exchange exposure is small.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk through its investment in overseas subsidiaries.
This is partially hedged by local debt, but the Group does not hedge the remaining exposure.
Generally, the Group does not hedge any net translation exposure of overseas earnings, although it may in certain circumstances implement hedges to secure short-term financial objectives.
Non-equity shares All of the Companys non-equity share capital has been redeemed or converted following the listing on the London Stock exchange on 15 May 2002.

The amounts shown take into account the effect of foreign exchange contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
The prole of currency exposures is profoundly different in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily due to the repayment of the US dollar Notes which has effectively eliminated the US dollar exposure.

On 24 April 2002 the Company entered into a new syndicated bank Senior Facility Agreement, conditional upon otation, consisting of a 275 million term debt and a 150 million revolving credit facility.
This was utilised on 15 May 2002 to repay the previous facility.
Interest on advances under the new Senior Facility Agreement was payable during the financial year at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5%.
Since the year end, on 23 May 2003, the margin on the senior bank debt reduced to 0.875%.
In addition to direct drawings under the revolving credit facility in the UK, the Group utilised the facility by drawing letters of credit to support facilities provided by local banks overseas.
Although these locally provided facilities nominally expired in less than one year, they could be renewed provided that the letter of credit drawn under the revolving credit facility is renewed.

Deferred taxation continued No provision has been made for further taxes which could arise if subsidiary undertakings are disposed of or if overseas companies were to remit dividends to the UK in excess of those anticipated in these accounts: it is considered impracticable to estimate the amount of such taxes.
At 26 April 2003 there are deferred tax assets of approximately 4.5 million 2002: 4.0 million resulting from tax losses and other timing differences which have not been recognised and will be recoverable when there are suitable taxable profits in the appropriate territory against which they can be relieved.
There is no unprovided deferred tax liability as at 26 April 2003 or 27 April 2002.

The utilisation of provisions in the current financial year of 5.1 million reected the closure of stores in HMV USA 3.7 million and Waterstones 1.4 million.
The 3.9 million provision created in the financial year was in respect of the closure of HMV Germany 1.0 million and further store closures in HMV USA 2.9 million.
The 2.2 million credit to operating profit was in respect of fair value acquisition provisions made in 1998 in accordance with FRS 7, which principally related to onerous leases with unexpired durations of up to a further eight years.
The Company did not have any provisions at either 26 April 2003 or 27 April 2002.
Share capital At 26 April 2003 the authorised share capital of the Company comprised 518,590,193 1p Ordinary Shares of which 403,290,659 were allotted, called up and fully paid.
During the period under review, significant changes were made to the authorised and issued share capital of the Company, as described below.
On 8 May 2002 the Company undertook a bonus issue, whereby 4.33776 new Ordinary Shares were issued for every existing Ordinary Share held.
The authorised share capital of the Company was then increased to 5,430,000 and $162,600 by the creation of 360,504,127 new Ordinary Shares.
This enlarged share capital was divided into: 81,300 12.875% Senior Cumulative Redeemable A Preference Shares of $1 each and 81,300 12.875% Senior Cumulative Redeemable B Preference Shares of $1 each: 29,400 12.875% Senior Cumulative Redeemable C Preference Shares of 0.615 each: 518,590,193 1p Ordinary Shares: and a Sterling Deferred Share with a nominal value of 226,017.
All of the Senior and Junior Preference Shares and the Sterling Deferred Share were subsequently cancelled at the Annual General Meeting on 1 October 2002.
The Initial Public Offering comprised the issue of 195,312,500 new Ordinary Shares, the sale of 84,255,525 existing Ordinary Shares by existing shareholders, and the issue of 17,652 new Ordinary Shares to satisfy options exercised in the Company, bringing the number of new Ordinary Shares issued on 15 May 2002 to 279,585,679.
Subsequent issues of Ordinary Shares to satisfy share options exercised brought the total number of issued Ordinary 1p Shares to 403,290,659.
Junior Preference Shares On 8 May 2002, all of the Junior Preference shares converted into 145,815,137 new Ordinary Shares and a non-voting sterling deferred share.
The non-voting Sterling Deferred Share was subsequently converted into a capital reserve and was cancelled together with the authorised Junior Preference Shares.
Senior Preference Shares The Senior Preference Shares were redeemed at 112.875% of the sum of the issue price and accumulated unpaid dividends 105.9 million on 28 June 2002.
The authorised Senior Preference Shares were subsequently cancelled.
Share premium On 15 May 2002, the share premium account was credited with 354.8 million after deduction of underwriting commissions and other fees and expenses payable by the Company of 18.0 million and after accounting for the bonus issue.

The Company has two share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Companys Ordinary Shares have been granted to certain Directors and senior management.
At 27 April 2002 910,601 options were in issue.
As a result of the bonus issue, these options converted to options over 4,860,514 HMV Group plc 1p Ordinary Shares and the option price was adjusted accordingly.
At 26 April 2003, therefore 16,402,609 options were in issue.
In the event of a winding up of the Company or other return on capital, the assets available for distribution to shareholders would be applied in the following order after payment of all debts and liabilities: i Repaying pari passu the amounts subscribed 1p per share for the Ordinary Shares.
ii Distributing pari passu any balance among the holders of the Ordinary Shares.
Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main schemes that cover employees in the United Kingdom, are the HMV Group Pension Scheme the Scheme established with effect from July 1998 and the EMI Group Pension Fund the Fund.
The Scheme The Scheme is based in the UK and has two sections the Pension benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
Pension benefit Section It is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and is contracted out of SERPS.
The Pension benefit Section is of the dened benefit type.
The benets it provides are based on final pensionable pay and are guaranteed to increase in payment by 5% per annum or by the increase in the cost of living, if less.
Members contribute at the rate of 4% of pensionable pay.
com Notes to the financial statements continued 26.
Pension arrangements continued A qualied actuary made an actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2002.
The valuation was based on an assumed investment return of 7.0% a year, salary increases of 4.0% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.5%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 94%, representing a funding deficit of 0.9 million.
In addition, the total cost of accruing benets was given as 16.8% of pensionable pay including an allowance for administrative expenses, of which members of the Pension benefit Section pay 4.0%, leaving the Companys regular cost at 12.8% of pensionable pay.
The market value of the assets of the Pension benefit Scheme at 30 June 2002 was about 13.1 million.
The next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2005.
In the light of the small deficit of assets over the cost of benets, the Company will contribute at a rate of 12.9% of pensionable pay from 1 June 2004.
This rate, calculated in accordance with the recommendations of the actuary, is sufficient to eliminate the deficit over a period of seven years.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension benefit Section for the 52 weeks ended 26 April 2003 were 1.0 million 2002: 0.9 million.
Pension Saver Section This Section was established for all other employees of the Group including those who were then members of the WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan up to 30 June 1998.
It is of the dened contribution type and is open to permanent staff of the Company who have completed three months service and are eligible to join.
Members can choose to pay from 2% to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Company matches the amount paid by the member up to a maximum of 5% of pensionable pay.
Members have a choice of ways to invest their and the Companys contributions in an individual fund to buy pension benets of their choice.
It also provides life assurance whilst members are employed by the Company.
The Fund The otation of the Companys shares on the London Stock Exchange on 15 May 2002 and the concurrent dilution of EMI Group plcs investment in the Company started a process of separation of pension arrangements, which will be complete with effect from 1 June 2003.
Consequently throughout the 52 weeks ended 26 April 2003 relevant HMV Group employees in the UK remained members of, and continued to participate in, the Fund.
The separation of pension arrangements provided each member with the option of taking up membership of the Scheme.
For members who so elect transferring members, a transfer value in respect of their accrued rights will be paid from the Fund to the Scheme.
The benets granted to transferring members will be broadly comparable with those which they had individually accrued in the Fund.
Certain executives are entitled to enhanced levels of benets under the Fund as executive members.
Some of those executives are subject to the earnings cap which limits the amount of their salary which may be treated as pensionable under an Inland Revenue exempt approved pension scheme and are members, or may become eligible for membership, of top-up arrangements for life insurance, pension and disability benets.
The present value of the liabilities represented by these accrued rights, was approximately 21.0 million as at 27 April 2003.
The transfer of assets would be expected to be broadly consistent with this amount, but would not be nalised until the point of transfer, which is dependent on the nalisation of an actuarial valuation of the Fund currently in progress.
EMI Group plc is the principal employer of the Fund.
The Fund is of the dened benefit type, is based in the UK, is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purposes of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and is contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
The Fund is open to all permanent employees of EMI Group over the age of 18 employed in the UK.
Benets provided by the Fund are based on final pensionable pay.
Pensions payable from the Fund are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or by the increase in the cost of living if less.
Members contribute to the Fund at the rate of 4% of pensionable pay.
The latest available actuarial valuation of the Fund was made by a qualied actuary as at 31 March 2000.
At that date, the market value of the assets of the EMI Fund was taken to be 1,079.0 million.
The market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 117% of the value of the benets that had accrued to the members, after allowing for assumed increases in earnings, on the actuarial assumptions used, treating the EMI Fund as an ongoing entity.
Part of the above excess assets disclosed by the 2000 valuation has been used to finance a special increase of 3% to pensions in payment and part has been allocated towards a reduction in employer contributions below the long-term rate, with the balance being carried forward as a reserve in the EMI fund.
Employer expense in respect of the Fund has been calculated in accordance with the recommendations of the actuary.
On the basis of actuarial advice, it is calculated that employer expense would represent a credit to the profit and loss account on full application of SSAP 24 principles.
However, for reasons of conservatism, such expense has been taken as nil for the 52 weeks ended 26 April 2003 2002: nil.
Pension arrangements continued FRS 17 Retirement Benets In accordance with the transitional implementation rules set out in FRS 17 Retirement Benets, additional disclosures are set out below.
These have been updated by professionally qualied actuaries to take into account the requirements of FRS 17 and to assess the liabilities of the Scheme at 26 April 2003.

Consequently, it has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 17 and will treat the Fund on a dened contribution basis until the arrangement ceases and the members transfer to the HMV scheme.
Accordingly, no FRS 17 transitional disclosures are required at 26 April 2003.
