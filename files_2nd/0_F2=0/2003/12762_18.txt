Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards apart from the true and fair override applied in respect of the Psion Exchangeable shares, as explained in notes 1b and 19.
The comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2002 has been restated in order to show the on-going business more distinctly in light of the sale of Psion Software and the proposed disposal of Psions interest in the Symbian joint venture.
b Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of all subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
In the Company balance sheet, investments in subsidiary undertakings and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
In 2000 the Group acquired Teklogix International Inc now combined with Psion Enterprise to form Psion Teklogix.
As part of the consideration, the Group issued 5,363,544 Psion Exchangeable Shares, which are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The Group and Company differ from the presentational requirements of the Companies Act 1985 in order to present a true and fair view see note 19. c Goodwill Goodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, arising on acquisitions since 1998 has been capitalised and is being written off on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life, which is a maximum of twenty years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in earlier periods was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
d Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method, which is a form of equity accounting under which the share of the gross assets and liabilities underlying the net amount included for the investment is shown on the face of the balance sheet and under which the share of turnover is shown in the profit and loss account.
e Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
f Tangible fixed assets All fixed assets are shown at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Freehold buildings: 2% per annum Leasehold buildings and improvements: shorter of term of the lease and estimated useful economic life Computers and equipment: 14% 33% per annum Office furniture and equipment: 20% per annum Motor vehicles: 25% per annum Production and test equipment: 25% 33% per annum Production line machinery: 16.67% per annum Production and test equipment developed and constructed by the Groups own personnel is capitalised on the basis of the cost of direct material, labour and other directly attributable costs.
This is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life of the asset and four years.
The plant and machinery caption in note 11 includes computers and equipment, office furniture and equipment, motor vehicles, production and test equipment and production line machinery.
g Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
h Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises the cost of materials, direct labour and overheads.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.

Accounting Policies continued i Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallise based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Following this policy, deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
j Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange of a related forward exchange contract.
As a result of this, gains and losses arising on forward foreign currency contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction is recognised in the Groups accounts.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange of a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
For the purposes of consolidation the closing rate method is used under which translation gains or losses are shown as a movement in other reserves in the Consolidated balance sheet.
Profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
The balance on other reserves represents cumulative translation differences arising from the translation of the net assets of foreign subsidiaries into sterling at differing exchange rates.
k Turnover Turnover is recognised on transfer of risk and rewards to the customer and when collection is reasonably assured.
In respect of software licences, turnover is recognised on customer acceptance.
In respect of contracted development of software, turnover is recognised as services are performed.
Turnover from maintenance or service agreements is recognised rateably over the term of the related contract.
Turnover is deferred when billings are made in advance of turnover recognition.
l Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged, on a straight line basis, to the profit and loss account over the lease term.
m Pension costs The Group maintains various defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the amount payable in respect of the year.
n Warranty costs Provision is made against future warranty costs relating to products sold based on experience of historical failure rates.
Psion 2003 41 Notes to the Accounts 2.
Adjusted operating profit is defined as earnings before tax, net interest income, goodwill write-offs and exceptional items.
The directors consider that adjusted operating profit reflects the underlying performance of the business.

The secured loan was taken out on 31 December 2001 and the interest charge is linked to LIBOR plus an average margin of 1.3%.
On 31 January 2002 the interest rate was fixed for 10 years at 5.5325% plus an average margin of 1.5%, and thereafter the rate is linked to LIBOR plus an average margin of 1.1%.
Financial Instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash, overdrafts, liquid resources, a secured loan and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of the financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions in the form of forward exchange currency contracts in order to manage certain aspects of the foreign currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group has significant cash balances.
The Groups general policy is to limit its exposure to interest rates by placing short term deposits on the money markets with maturities up to twelve months.
In respect of its twenty year secured loan, the Group fixed the interest rate for 10 years in January 2002 at a rate of 5.5325% plus an average margin of 1.5%, and thereafter the rate is linked to LIBOR plus an average margin of 1.1%.
Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposure principally to the Euro, US Dollar and Canadian Dollar arising from foreign currency sales and purchases.
The Groups policy is to manage this risk through forward contracts which are taken out to cover between two and six months of forecast net currency cash flows.
The Groups foreign currency exposure to the net investment in overseas subsidiaries is not hedged.
As permitted by FRS 13, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following analyses, other than for the analysis of currency exposure.
Interest rate exposure Floating rate 2003 2002 000s 000s Cash and liquid resources: Sterling 3,017 24,092 Euro 5,686 2,380 Canadian Dollar 3,357 393 US Dollar 4,236 2,855 Other currencies 1,074 1,164 Overdrafts: Sterling 759 US Dollar 32 Other currencies 17 17, 370 30,076 As described above, in January 2002 the interest rate on the secured loan was fixed for ten years see note 16 and therefore the loan is not included in the above analysis of floating interest rate exposure in the current year.
Of the total cash balance 1,432,000 2002 14,276,000 was placed in deposit accounts with a weighted average period until maturity of one week 2002 one week.
The remaining cash balances are held in current accounts.
All interest rates are based on the current local bank lending or deposit rate for that currency, as appropriate.

Financial Instruments continued Borrowing facilities At 31 December 2003 the Group had a revolving note facility of US$25,000,000 2002 US$25,000,000 of which nil 2002 808,000 was used at the year end, and a secured loan of 5,440,000 2002 5,717,000.
The revolving note facility expires on 31 May 2004 and the group expects it to be renewed at that time.
Fair values The book value of all the financial assets detailed above, except for the secured loan, approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the assets or because floating interest rates are used.
There were no forward currency contracts at the year end 2002 fair value 258,000, book value nil.
Foreign currency exposure The transactional currency exposures to the Groups main functional currencies at 31 December 2003 were: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Functional currency Sterling CAN $ US $ Euro Others Total of Group operation 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Sterling 8 18 1,836 24 1,850 CAN Dollar 451 1,7781,187 27 3,389 US Dollar Euro 42 22 64 Other 1,329 371 2,109 3,809 409 8 3,067 3,394 2,106 8,984 The exposures at 31 December 2002 for comparison purposes were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Functional currency Sterling CAN $ US $ Euro Others Total of Group operation 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Sterling 25 237 821 18 627 CAN Dollar 2,926 3,174 1,496 2,898 10,494 US Dollar Euro 88 23 111 Other 51 315 323 2,156 2,199 2,787 25 3,073 998 724 7,557 The balances above are stated net of hedging forward currency contracts where applicable.
They do not take into account future foreign currency sales and purchases.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December 2003 is shown in notes 15 and 16.
Gains and losses on forward currency contracts are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
An analysis of all unrecognised gains and losses is as follows: 2003 2002 Gains Losses Total Total 000s 000s 000s 000s Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges as at 1 January 258 258 1 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were included in the profit and loss account in the year 258 258 1 Gains and losses arising before 1 January that were not recognised in the year Gains and losses arising in the year that were not recognised in the year 258 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges as at 31 December 258 There were no forward currency contracts at 31 December 2003.

Provisions for restructuring This comprises provisions for onerous leases of 5,551,000 2002 6,418,000 and supplier commitments of 59,000 2002 191,000 arising from the discontinued Digital operations.
The provision for supplier commitments is expected to be fully utilised in 2004.
The remaining 347,000 2002 nil relates to the restructuring provision in Psion Teklogix.
Contingent consideration This relates to the acquisition of Psion France in October 2000.
The decrease in the provision reflects payment of performance-related consideration in the year.
The remaining payments are expected to be made in 2004.
Share Capital and Shares To Be Issued 2003 2002 000s 000s Authorised: 532,619,920 2002 532,619,920 Ordinary Shares of 5p each 26,631 26,631 Allotted, called up and fully paid: 415,189,629 2002 414,802,529 Ordinary Shares of 5p each 20,759 20,740 During the year 22,100 Ordinary Shares were issued following the exchange of Exchangeable Shares and 365,000 Ordinary Shares were issued for cash in respect of the exercise of share options.
Share Capital and Shares To Be Issued continued As part consideration for the acquisition of Teklogix International Inc in September 2000, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company issued 5,363,544 Psion Exchangeable Shares which have been shown as Psion Ordinary Shares to be issued.
The holders of these shares have the right to exchange them, on a one for one basis, for Psion Ordinary Shares.
Under the Shareholders Agreement, Psion Exchangeable Shares rank equally with Psion Ordinary Shares, with the same rights and benefits including voting and receiving of dividends.
Therefore for the consolidated financial statements to present a true and fair view it is necessary to differ from the presentational requirements of the Companies Act 1985 by including these exchangeable shares in the capital and reserves section of the balance sheet as Psion Ordinary Shares to be issued, as the Group has in essence purchased the entire share capital of Teklogix International Inc for consideration of Psion Ordinary shares.
The Companies Act 1985 would require the presentation of such shares as a minority interest.
This would not give a true and fair view as it would indicate that these shares do not rank equally with Psion Ordinary Shares.
All remaining Psion Exchangeable Shares will be exchanged on 31 January 2010.
Exchange can be enforced earlier if fewer than 1,000,000 Psion Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding or under the circumstances as set out in the Shareholders Agreement.
The amount attributable to Psion Exchangeable Shareholders is included in the capital and reserves section of the balance sheet as Psion Ordinary Shares to be issued, based on the market price of 8.40 as at 20 September 2000, the date on which the Teklogix International Inc acquisition was approved by the shareholders.
Options over Ordinary Shares The Company has granted options including Directors options in respect of the following Ordinary Shares of 5p each: Further details of options held by directors can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 31.
Reserves The movement on reserves during the year was as follows: Group Group & Company Company Profit Share Profit Capital Other and loss premium Shares to Capital Other and loss reserve reserves account account be issued reserve reserves account 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Beginning of the year 3,682 27,819 163,592 16,828 1,046 12 3,537 Issued shares 2 69 Conversion of shares to be issued 174 12 186 174 Transfer to profit and loss account 1 74 174 Unrealised gain on investment in joint venture 4,065 Share of foreign currency translation of joint venture 24 Foreign currency translation 1,4778 Loss for the year 17,978 21,486 End of the year 2,181 41,556 163,673 16,642 1,220 20 25,023 No Company profit and loss account is presented for Psion PLC as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Company reported a loss after tax of 21,486,000 for the year ended 31 December 2003 2002 3,537,000.
As disclosed in note 19 the Group issued Psion Exchangeable Shares as part consideration in the acquisition of Teklogix International Inc.
Psion Exchangeable Shares outstanding are shown as Shares to be issued.
The Capital Reserve represents the difference on the exchange of exchangeable shares between the market price of 8.40 on 20 September 2000, the date on which Teklogix International Inc was acquired by the Group, and the market price on the date of exchanges during the year.
