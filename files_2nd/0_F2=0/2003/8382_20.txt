66 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2003 The analysis of consolidated turnover and operating profit before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and goodwill impairment by historic business division in note 1 to the accounts is the most appropriate presentation for the annual accounts of the Group.
However, as announced in our recent trading update in April 2003, the Group will be narrowing its focus from two main divisions to one, Production Management.
It will also continue to develop its Rail System business.
The rest of the businesses will be managed as an expanded Development division.
For information, an analysis of sales and operating profit before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and goodwill impairment by new business segment for each of the last two financial years is shown below.
For the sake of clarity, the Group will present the costs of corporate centres and also pension costs as separate segments within the segmental analysis by business division.
