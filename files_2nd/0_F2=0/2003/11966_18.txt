52 P&O Annual Report 2003 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to these accounts.
Basis of preparation of accounts The accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis, modied to include certain land and buildings at market value, and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 except as stated under land and buildings and properties held for development and sale.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The Group has followed the transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benets in these accounts.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest, usually from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the equity voting rights, and over which it exercises significant inuence.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the turnover and profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their assets and liabilities is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Goodwill arising on consolidation Purchased goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was deducted from reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously deducted from reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised.
Goodwill is amortised to nil on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, which can be up to 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the Groups acquisition of its joint ventures and associates less accumulated amortisation is included in the carrying amount for the joint ventures and associates.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are stated at cost less any impairment in value.
Where merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 1985 apply, investments of the Company are accounted for on the basis of the nominal value of shares issued as purchase consideration.
Other investments are stated at historical cost net of provisions for impairment.
Land and buildings Land and buildings occupied by Group companies are included in xed assets at their latest valuations plus subsequent additions at cost, and surpluses and deficits on valuation are included in the revaluation reserve.
Land and buildings are valued systematically over five years by external valuers.
profits and losses on sale of land and buildings are calculated by reference to their net carrying amounts.
In the case of freehold buildings and leasehold land and buildings occupied by Group companies annual depreciation is provided on a straight line basis.
Freehold buildings are written off over 50 years and leasehold land and buildings are written off over the remainder of the lease period.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Provision for any impairment in value of land and buildings held as xed assets is made in the profit and loss account, except in the case of land and buildings which have previously been revalued upwards, when the provision is made to the revaluation reserve to the extent of the previous revaluation.
Included in land and buildings are assets under construction, which are held at cost.
These assets are depreciated from the date on which they come into use.
Interest incurred in respect of costs relating to assets under construction is capitalised into the cost of the asset concerned.
Investment properties, within land and buildings, are included at their latest valuations plus subsequent additions at cost.
A substantial proportion by value of investment properties, including the largest properties, is valued annually by the Groups chief surveyor and triennially by external valuers.
P&O Annual Report 2003 53 Notes to the accounts Depreciation or amortisation is not provided in respect of freehold or long leasehold investment properties.
This treatment is a departure from the Companies Act 1985 concerning the depreciation of xed assets in respect of certain of these properties.
However, such properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate and that this policy is necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reected in the valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identied or quantied.
Ships and other xed assets These assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Assets acquired under finance leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, the future capital payments being included in loans.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of these assets to estimated residual value, on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the asset concerned.
Generally for ships this is between 10 and 35 years, and for other xed assets reported within plant and machinery, xtures and ttings various periods of up to 40 years, the most significant of which are cold storage facilities up to 40 years, port equipment, such as cranes and straddle carriers up to 25 years and other port equipment, such as forklifts, tractors and trailers 5 to 10 years.
Provision for any impairment in value of ships and other xed assets is made in the profit and loss account.
Assets constructed by the Group are depreciated from the date on which they come into use.
Properties held for development and sale Properties held for development and sale are included in current assets at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For properties previously held for investment, which the directors have decided are to be developed or sold and which are reclassied as properties held for development and sale, cost is considered to be the latest valuation prior to their reclassication.
This treatment is a departure from the Companies Act 1985 which would normally require current assets to be carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The directors consider that compliance with this requirement would fail to give a true and fair view of historic revaluation surpluses, which remain unrealised by the Group until disposal.
Interest and other outgoings less income receivable are charged to the profit and loss account during development, except in respect of certain overseas properties where the development period is extensive, when such amounts are included in cost.
In certain subsidiaries, realised capital profits on the sale of properties are not ordinarily available for distribution and accordingly these capital profits are transferred to other reserves.
These capital profits can be distributed by the passing of a special resolution by the subsidiary.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Liquid resources Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.
Turnover Turnover comprises amounts derived from the provision of goods and services to third parties excluding VAT and similar sales taxes and includes rent receivable from properties.
Turnover from the provision of goods includes sales of properties held for development and sale, recognised when contracts become unconditional.
Turnover from the provision of services is recognised on the delivery of those services, which for Ports is once the relevant throughput has taken place, for Ferries is on provision of carriage and for P&O Nedlloyd is on completion of the shipping or transport operation.
Leases Certain ships, plant and machinery and land and buildings nanced by leasing agreements giving rights approximating to ownership are capitalised as tangible xed assets at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The capital element of future lease payments is treated as a liability.
The interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the finance lease in proportion to the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
All other leases are classied as operating leases with the lease rentals payable being charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis.
Pension schemes Contributions for ongoing benefit accruals paid to schemes in respect of dened benefit pension schemes are calculated as a percentage, agreed on actuarial advice, of the pensionable salaries of employees.
The cost of providing dened benefit pensions is charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the periods benefiting from the services of employees.
Differences between the amounts charged to the profit and loss account and payments made to the pension schemes are treated as assets or liabilities.
Contributions including lump sum payments in respect of dened contribution pension schemes and multi employer dened benefit schemes, where it is not possible to identify the Groups share of the scheme, are charged to the profit and loss account when they are payable.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet dates except in respect of revalued xed assets where there is no 54 P&O Annual Report 2003 Notes to the accounts commitment to sell the asset, gains on sale of assets which are rolled over into replacement assets and the remittance of taxable subsidiary, associate or joint venture earnings where no commitment has been made to the remittance of those earnings.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Non-interest bearing amounts due after one year are discounted at a rate approximating to current interest rates.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
profits and losses of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates which have currencies of operation other than sterling are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange except for material exceptional items which are translated at the rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates which have currencies of operation other than sterling and any related loans are taken to reserves together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The Group has redened its geographical segmental analysis in 2003, and restated the 2002 comparative gures accordingly.
The directors consider, in light of the diverse international nature of the Group, that the redened segments provide a more useful analysis of the geographical split of the Groups operations.

P&O Annual Report 2003 61 Notes to the accounts 5 Taxation continued b Factors affecting the taxation charge for the current period The current taxation charge is lower 2002 higher than the profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK, 30% 2002 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2003 2002 m m profit loss on ordinary activities before taxation 80.0 135.7 profit loss on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2002 30% 24.0 40.7 Effects of: profits and losses on sale of xed assets and businesses not subject to taxation 1.7 43.9 UK expenses not deductible and other UK permanent adjustments 8.8 2.5 Unutilised UK tax losses arising in the year 9.6 14.7 Timing differences taken up in deferred tax 24.4 13.8 Tonnage tax in UK Group 6.5 1.3 Variance from overseas tax rates and adjustments 3.4 9.5 Variance on joint ventures and associates 5.2 29.3 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 14.3 18.3 Current taxation charge for the period 6.7 25.8 The Groups principal shipping businesses and P&O Nedlloyd and Associated Bulk Carriers operate under the UK tonnage tax regime, and comparable overseas tonnage tax regimes, under which the current year tax charge arising is calculated by reference to the net tonnage of the ships operated by the business rather than the tax adjusted profit or loss of the business.
The Groups overseas tax rates are typically a mixture of higher and lower than 30 per cent.
They include the effect of overseas tonnage tax applicable to shipping operations, and overseas tax benets available to some infrastructure projects.
The joint ventures and associates tax rates are typically a mixture of higher and lower than 30 per cent.
They include the effect of P&O Nedlloyd and Associated Bulk Carriers operating under the UK tonnage tax regime, and overseas tax benets available to some infrastructure projects.
c Factors which may affect future tax charges The UK tax losses not utilised can only be carried forward against certain categories of non shipping UK income, including receipt of overseas dividends.
The Group is subject to ongoing routine audits and enquiries from tax authorities around the world.
The eventual outcome of these may result in further amounts of tax payable which are greater than or less than the related provisions held in the balance sheet.
The UK tonnage tax regime referred to above includes provision whereby a proportion of capital allowances previously claimed by the Group may be subject to tax in the event of a significant number of ships owned at the time the Group entered tonnage tax being sold and not replaced.
This contingent liability diminishes to nil over the period to 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2003, the Groups contingent liability in respect of this provision would be 29.5m 2002 40.0m on the assumption that all ships and related assets are sold at book value and not replaced.
In accordance with FRS19, no deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
Also in accordance with FRS19, no provision has been made for deferred tax on gains and losses recognised on revaluing property.
The total amount unprovided is 8.0m 2002 6.6m.

In accordance with the provisions of merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company recorded the cost of the investment in the subsidiary company at the nominal value of the deferred stock issued.
On consolidation, the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of the deferred stock has been recorded in the Groups merger reserve, within other reserves.
Costs arising on the issue of the deferred stock have been written off to the Companys share premium account.

The principal scheme, The P&O Pension Scheme, is located in the UK and is a funded dened benefit scheme which was closed to routine new members on 1 January 2002.
The assets of the scheme are managed on behalf of the trustee by independent fund managers.
The Group also operates a number of smaller dened benefit and dened contribution schemes and makes contributions to various industry schemes.
These generally have assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
SSAP24 Accounting for pension costs The pension charge for the year was: 2003 2002 m m The UK Scheme 14.9 10.1 Merchant navy pension schemes 6.2 6.2 Other dened benefit schemes 7.1 4.8 Dened contribution schemes 8.1 5.5 Other industry schemes 5.5 2.1 Unfunded liabilities 0.1 41.8 28.6 In addition to the above a total of 2.6m 2002 1.9m has been charged in respect of ill health, early retirement and other pension augmentations.
For the principal scheme and certain other material schemes the pension charge for the year has been based on valuations in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs.
Differences between the amounts charged and the amounts paid are included within prepayments or creditors as appropriate.
As at 31 December 2003, the total prepayments amounted to 2.8m 2002 2.4m and total creditors amounted to 6.5m 2002 1.1m, giving a net pension liability in the balance sheet of 3.7m 2002 1.3m asset.
A summary of the main financial assumptions for the UK scheme for SSAP24 purposes as at 1 January 2003 is set out below: % Discount rate 6.65 Rate of increase in salaries 3.75 Rate of increase in pensions 2.25 Ination rate 2.25 Under these assumptions there is a deficit on the UK scheme which has resulted in a pension variation charge for the Group, excluding the Groups share of P&O Nedlloyd, of 6.2m.
FRS17 Retirement benets For the purposes of the accounting disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17, the latest valuation of the UK scheme and those of other material dened benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2003 by qualied independent actuaries.
74 P&O Annual Report 2003 Notes to the accounts 24 Pensions continued The principal assumptions are included in the table below.
The less material dened benefit schemes have been aggregated and the assumptions are given in the form of weighted averages.
These other schemes are principally in the UK, Australia, the USA and the Netherlands.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

As a result, for the purposes of the FRS17 disclosure, the underlying assets and liabilities of the UK scheme have been adjusted to reect this allocation from 1 January 2003.
This gives a net pension liability under FRS17 that is consistent and reasonable with reference to the companies deficit contributions.
The comparatives for previous years reect 100 per cent of the UK scheme.
It should be noted that, if P&O Nedlloyd is not able to make payments due from it to the UK scheme, the trustee may seek additional payments from Group companies to make good the shortfall, thereby allocating more of the schemes assets and liabilities back to the Group.
The allocation of the UK scheme deficit payments has principally been to shipping companies within the UK tonnage tax regime.
These companies benefit from operating in the tonnage tax regime, and so will not receive tax relief for the payments and hence a related deferred tax asset is not recognised in respect of the FRS17 deficit arising on the scheme.

P&O Annual Report 2003 77 Notes to the accounts 24 Pensions continued The Group provides dened contribution 401k plans for its US employees and some post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, principally in the US.
The cost of these post-retirement healthcare benefit plans is not considered material to these accounts.
UK scheme actuarial valuation for funding purposes Formal actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are carried out triennially by qualied independent actuaries, the latest valuation report for the scheme being at 1 April 2003, using the Projected Unit valuation method.
At this date the market value of the UK schemes assets was 996m and the value of accrued benets to members allowing for future increases in earnings was 1,154m giving a deficit of 158m and a funding ratio of 86.3 per cent.
Excluding the deficit reduction payments described below, the contribution rate for the UK scheme was 21.2 per cent to 31 December 2003 and is an average of 19.3 per cent from 1 January 2004.
The principal long term assumptions in the UK schemes 2003 valuation were: Nominal % per annum Price ination 3.00 Investment return on existing assets 7.10 Investment return on future contributions 6.60 Earnings escalation 4.50 LEL escalation 3.00 Increases in pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions 2.75 As a result of this valuation the Group, including joint ventures, is making additional cash contributions totalling 20m per annum which are scheduled to continue until 31 March 2015 but with a review of the level of these contributions to be undertaken at the next funding valuation.
The initial nine month catch up payment of 15m was made in January 2004 with monthly payments totalling 1.7m thereafter.
Industry schemes The Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund MNRPF and the Merchant Navy Ofcers Pension Fund MNOPF are industry wide dened benefit pension schemes.
The MNRPF is a dened benefit multi-employer scheme in which sea staff employed by companies within the Group have participated.
The scheme has a funding deficit and has been closed to further benefit accrual.
As at 31 March 2002, the date of the most recent full triennial actuarial valuation carried out by an independent actuary, the scheme had assets with a market value of 506m, representing 84 per cent of the benets accrued to members allowing for future increases.
The scheme had however exceeded its minimum funding requirement at that date.
Approximately 66 per cent of the schemes assets were invested in bonds, 23 per cent in equities and 11 per cent in property and cash.
The valuation assumptions were as follows: % Discount rate 5.8 Rate of salary increases 4.0 Rate of pension increases where increases apply 2.5 Expected return on assets 5.8 As a result of this valuation a revised xed schedule of payments has been drawn up which remains in place until 31 March 2007.
Companies within the Group, along with other employers, are making these payments into the scheme under a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to reduce the deficit.
The Group is making contributions in respect of subsidiaries that are current employers in the scheme and in respect of subsidiaries that have settled the relevant statutory debt obligations and are no longer current employers within the scheme.
Payments by the Group to the scheme in 2003 totalled 5.6m, which included amounts previously provided for and represented 43 per cent of the total payments made by all employers.
These payments are included within the merchant navy pension schemes charge on page 73.
The Group cannot identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the MNRPF on a consistent and reasonable basis and is therefore accounting for the MNRPF under both SSAP24 and FRS17 as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
For FRS17 purposes the trustees of the MNRPF have not updated the actuarial valuation to 31 December 2003.
78 P&O Annual Report 2003 Notes to the accounts 24 Pensions continued The MNOPF is a dened benefit multi-employer scheme in which ofcers employed by companies within the Group have participated and continue to participate.
The share of the contributions being made to the scheme by Group companies based on the year to 31 December 2003 was approximately 17 per cent.
In addition P&O Nedlloyd had a 6 per cent share of total contributions.
The scheme is divided into two sections, the Old Section and the New Section both of which are closed to new members and the latest valuation was carried out at 31 March 2000.
The Old Section has been closed to benefit accrual since 1978.
The schemes independent actuary advised that at 31 March 2000 the market value of the schemes assets for the Old Section was 1,388m, representing approximately 111 per cent of the value of the benets accrued to members on the valuation basis.
The assets of the Old Section were substantially invested in bonds.
Accordingly, the fall in equity markets since March 2000 is not expected to have had a significant effect on the Old Section and it is expected that the valuation as at 31 March 2003, when nalised, will continue to show the Old Section in surplus.
As at 31 March 2000, the date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, the New Section had assets with a market value of 1,666m, representing approximately 100 per cent of the benets accrued to members.
The valuation assumptions were as follows: % Discount rate 5.75 Rate of salary increases 4.00 Rate of pension increases where increases apply 2.50 Expected return on assets 5.75 At the date of the valuation, approximately 77 per cent of the New Sections assets were invested in equities, 14 per cent in bonds and 9 per cent in property and cash.
As a result of this asset distribution, it is expected that the fall in equity markets since March 2000 will have resulted in the New Section assets now showing a significant reduction in value.
A full valuation of the MNOPF is due as at 31 March 2003 when it is expected that the position will have deteriorated since 31 March 2000 and the fund will show a significant deficit.
It is unclear how the deficit will be allocated between employers and there is currently a court case in progress to establish the principles for such allocation.
For FRS17 purposes although the employers contributions to the MNOPF would be affected by a surplus or deficit in the scheme, the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Group is therefore accounting for contributions to the MNOPF as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
P&O have appointed an independent actuary to estimate the deficit of the MNOPF New Section at 31 December 2003 using the same assumptions as applied for the FRS17 valuation of P&Os own UK scheme as set out above.
Based on the share of current contributions to the scheme made by P&O Group companies, the Groups share of the estimated deficit could be 100m.
As noted above the actual basis of allocation is unclear and the Groups share of the deficit could be higher or lower than this gure.
Other industry schemes are mainly overseas multi-employer schemes, in which the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Group is therefore accounting for contributions to these schemes as if they were dened contribution schemes for FRS17 purposes.
Joint ventures Within the Groups principal joint venture, P&O Nedlloyd, similar arrangements are in place.
P&O Nedlloyd has eligible employees and contributes to the UK scheme as described above, the same merchant navy schemes and some of the same other industry schemes as well as to the principal scheme of the Groups joint venture partner, Royal Nedlloyd N. V. which is effectively a dened contribution scheme.
Company The Company is a participating employer in the UK scheme.
Applying the assumptions for FRS17 set out in the tables above, its share of the schemes assets is 209.1m and the share of the schemes liabilities is 267.8m, resulting in a net deficit of 58.7m.
This amount would be deducted from the Company reserves under FRS17.

The other contingent liabilities in 2003 relate to the present value of total commitments of Associated Bulk Carriers Limited and its subsidiary for seven leased chartered vessels.
The leases charters expire between 2008 and 2011.
Associated Bulk Carriers Limited was sold to Eurotower Holdings SA in December 2003 and as part of the transaction, P&O received a counter indemnity for these liabilities from First Omega Shipping Inc, the owner of Eurotower and a significant number of other shipping interests.
On 3 September 2003, the Company announced that the European Commission had commenced an investigation concerning possible infringements of European Community competition law in connection with the provision of passenger and or freight transport services excluding by air between the United Kingdom, Ireland and Continental Europe.
The Company is one of the companies that has been visited by the European Commission in connection with the investigation.
