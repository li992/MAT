The plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan improperly calculated lump sum distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million.
The settlement documents are being prepared.
The settlement is subject to approval by the court at a fairness hearing.
A provision of US$69 million has been made in the year.
Under UK accounting principles FRS17, this has been recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account of the Group.
It has been shown as an exceptional item.
The settlement will be paid out of Plan assets.
ii Restructuring costs Restructuring costs were incurred for various programmes including programmes under the business initiative announced in August 2001.
All of these programmes have now been completed.
The major restructuring programmes included the restructuring of BOC Edwards manufacturing capacity, investments in information management systems and restructuring to deliver operational efficiencies in Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products.
Cash flow from operating activities includes an outflow of 28.3 million in 2003 2002:48.0 million, 2001:22.4 million in respect of these restructuring costs.
Restructuring costs also include a charge of 8.3 million 2002 and 2001:nil relating to the integration of BOCs gases business and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
iii Write-downs of assets The write-down in 2002 related to the merger of BOCs gases business and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
The net assets of OSK the existing BOC gases business in Japan, which had included an increase in the value of fixed assets through property revaluations in the 1980s and early 1990s, were reduced to an appropriate amount based on valuations performed ahead of the merger.
This resulted in a write-down of 32.7 million, of which 11.5 million was taken against the revaluation reserve and the balance of 21.2 million was charged as an exceptional item in 2002.
The write-downs in 2001 related to the business initiative announced in August 2001 with the objective of releasing cash tied up in unproductive assets and improving cash generation.
iv Costs of proposed takeover No costs were incurred in 2003 in respect of the proposed takeover.
The final costs associated with the pre-conditional offer for the Group were incurred in 2002 in respect of share options and other costs related to the retention of key employees.

The costs of 21.3 million for closing BOCs Process Plants business were charged as an exceptional item in 2002.
This included severance costs for 215 employees, the write-down of assets and the costs of winding down the business.
Cash flow from operating activities above includes an outflow of 4.1 million 2002:12.5 million, 2001:nil in respect of these exceptional costs.
In April 2002 BOC Edwards agreed the sale of its US glass coating business, resulting in a profit on disposal of 1.1 million.
vi In 2001, proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets were 41.2 million.
Of this, 39.0 million was from those assets which were sold at a profit and 2.2 million was from those assets which were sold at a loss.

The current tax charges will also be affected by changes in the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation and the use of tax credits.
e Unused tax credits On a consolidated basis, the Group has net operating loss carryforwards of 51.7 million.
If not offset against taxable income, these losses will expire as follows: Net operating loss Year million 2004 8.4 2005 2006 0.4 2007 2008 Thereafter, or no expiry date 42.9 For US Federal tax purposes, the Group has investment tax credits and general business tax credits to carry forward of approximately 12.9 million, which are available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable.
These do not expire until 2004 or thereafter.
In addition, the Group has alternative minimum tax credits for US Federal income tax purposes of approximately 24.8 million which can be carried forward to reduce regular tax liabilities of future years.
There is no expiration date on these credits.
Investment tax credits are accounted for by the flow-through method whereby they reduce income taxes currently payable and the provision for income taxes in the period in which the assets giving rise to such credits are placed in service.
Deferred tax assets, subject to the need for a valuation allowance, are recognised to the extent that the investment tax credits are not currently utilised.

Options and incentive schemes a Policy Executive options that are granted at the market price of the companys shares at the time of the grant do not attract a compensation expense under UK GAAP.
For those executive options, including the Long-Term Incentive Plan, that are granted at a discount to the market price of the companys shares at the time of the grant, the compensation expense is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the option.
The Group takes advantage of the exemption granted under UITF17, Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recorded for employee schemes that are granted at a discount.
b Summary of movements BOC operates share option schemes for both executives and employees.
The features of these are given in the report on remuneration and the employees report.
The long-term incentive and executive share award plans were granted at an option price of nil.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Pensions and other retirement benefits a UK GAAP Group The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The larger schemes are self-administered and the schemesassets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes were closed to new members with effect from 30 June 2003 and replaced with a new defined contribution plan.
On the advice of the actuaries, company contributions to the main UK scheme were resumed at a rate of 14.4 per cent of payroll on 1 October 2002.
Normal company contributions in respect of current service will reduce to 13.8 per cent from 1 October 2003 but, from that date, the company will make additional contributions in order to reduce the funding valuation deficit.
For the year to 30 September 2004, these additional contributions to the main UK scheme will be 30 million.
In the US, company contributions to the pension plan remain suspended as the plan continues to be in surplus.
In Australia, company contributions recommenced on 1 October 2001 at rates ranging from 11 per cent to 17 per cent of payroll.
In South Africa, in accordance with legislation, company contributions were resumed on 7 December 2001.
They were increased in June 2003, and currently range from 14.7 per cent to 21.2 per cent of payroll.
Under the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified in Regulations to the Act to improve current and former membersbenefits before the employer can obtain any benefit from the surpluses.
Consequently, it is considered unlikely that the company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes.
Therefore, in accordance with FRS17, the surpluses at 30 September 2003 have been written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The current cost of defined benefit pension arrangements is calculated using an actuarial methodology known as projected unit credit.
Under this methodology, as the UK and South African defined benefit schemes, and the defined benefit guarantee of the Australian scheme, are closed to new members, the current cost expressed as a percentage of pensionable salaries will tend to increase as members approach retirement.
The most recent actuarial funding valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 30 September 2003 for the purposes of FRS17.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 September 2003.

In accordance with the standard, the company treats contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution plan.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes cover a number of the Groups UK undertakings and cannot readily be split between each undertaking on a consistent and reliable basis.
The pension cost recognised in the companys accounts is the total of company contributions payable to Group UK pension schemes in the year.
The assets of all Group UK pension schemes are held independently of the Groups finances.
The largest schemes are self-administered.

In 2003 the amortisation of pension prior service cost includes 43.2 million in respect of a settlement of litigation from which the company will derive no future economic benefit.
It is estimated that a one per cent change in the weighted average health care costs trend would have the following effects on the accumulated benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost at 30 September 2003: One percentage point Increase Decrease Accumulated benefit obligation 4.6 4.3 Net periodic pension cost 0.5 0.5 9.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The company has only one category of dilutive potential shares:those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year and where any performance conditions have been met at the balance sheet date.

Under UK GAAP UITF31 the combination of Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK with the industrial and medical gases businesses of Air Liquide Japan to form Japan Air Gases Limited has been accounted for as a part disposal.
BOCs Japanese subsidiary retained a 45 per cent interest in Japan Air Gases Limited.
Accordingly, 55 per cent of any previously recognised goodwill relating to Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK has been deemed to have been disposed.
The remaining 45 per cent has been transferred to fixed asset investments as part of the Group share of the net assets of the Japan Air Gases joint venture.

d Facilities The Group maintains a number of short and medium-term committed lines of credit.
The main medium-term facilities are multi-currency agreements with a group of relationship banks, under which the Group may borrow up to US$450.0 million 271 million 2002:US$420.0 million 268 million for general corporate purposes.
These facilities were undrawn both at 30 September 2003 and 30 September 2002.

e Security The secured loans, maturing between 2003 and 2017, are principally secured by charges over the property, plant and machinery, stocks and trade debtors of certain overseas subsidiaries.
Financial instruments a Interest rate, currency and counterparty exposure The Groups approach to managing currency and interest rate risk and its use of swaps in that process is described on pages 47 and 48 in the financial review under the heading management of financial risks.
Interest rate swaps At 30 September 2003, the Group had entered into six interest rate swap agreements 2002:six with its main relationship banks with notional principal amounts of 417.6 million 2002:420.0 million.
The swapsunderlying currencies are sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen.

For those bearing either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest an assessment of the interest rate at which the Group could make the same loan under current conditions has been made.
Unless this differs significantly from the fixed rate it is also deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
Where this does differ significantly, the fair value is based on the discounted value of future cash flows.
For equity instruments listed on a recognised stock exchange the fair value is the quoted market price.
For other equity instruments it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
The fair value is the quoted market price.
Where no quoted market price exists, it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
As all bear either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest the fair value is either the quoted market price where a liquid market exists or has been calculated using well established pricing models.
The carrying amount is deemed to approximate to the fair value.
The fair value is the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.
The fair value represents the net effect on the Group of closing out all outstanding contracts.
Includes foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements.
ii Hedges As explained on pages 47 and 48 of the financial review under the heading management of financial risks, the Groups policies are to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures principally arising through anticipated sales and purchase transactions and swap agreements to manage interest rate risks and hedge structural currency exposures.
Currency swaps are only held to change the currency of the Groups borrowings to match better its net investments in its overseas subsidiaries.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policies, the assets and liabilities arising from these swap agreements are translated into sterling at the spot rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match the exchange gains or losses on the net investments in the overseas subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the swap agreements as shown in note 21 b i is the result of the exchange gains and losses recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, and is analysed in the deferred gains and losses table shown below.

After taking account of the hedging transactions, there was no significant net profit and loss account exposure to currency gains and losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities at 30 September 2003. d Financial instruments i Financial assets The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial assets excluding short-term debtors at 30 September 2003 is shown below.

The floating rate financial assets, which principally comprise cash and deposits, current asset investments and loans to joint ventures and associates, carry interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial assets are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.

The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 20 b.
Floating rate financial liabilities other than borrowings are mainly employee incentive provisions.
These are expected to be utilised over the period to 2011 depending on the future choices of the relevant employees.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid principally relate to creditors due after more than one year.
The majority of the amount relates to deposits for cylinder rentals.
It is not anticipated that this balance will reduce significantly in the short to medium term.
The remaining balances falling due after more than one year are expected to be paid or utilised by 2006.

108 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 22.
Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Incentive and other employee provisions include long-term share incentive units and deferred compensation plans.
Note 7 contains further details of the long-term share incentive units.
Provision for uninsured losses covers third party liabilities or claims.
Due to the time frame that is often involved in such claims, a significant part of this provision is subject to actuarial valuation.
Where this is not appropriate, other external assessments are used.
The restructuring provisions represent expenditure to be incurred on major reorganisations.
In 2003 28.3 million was spent of which 4.3 million was provided for at 30 September 2002 and 0.8 million was provided for at 30 September 2001.
The provisions remaining at 30 September 2003 consist mainly of redundancy costs and will be spent during 2004.
Environmental provisions have been set aside to cover the costs of remediation for a number of hazardous waste sites.
The costs are expected to be incurred between 2003 and 2030.
Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, the provision has been discounted at a rate of four per cent.
The effect of discounting is 6 million.
Other provisions are principally for warranty and legal costs.

b Legal proceedings Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation BOC has been named in numerous lawsuits in the US alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes.
Many of these cases were filed during 2003.
Certain of these cases have been either filed in, or transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation MDL proceeding has been commenced.
The MDL proceeding is still at an early stage.
The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US.
In addition to the cases in federal court, BOC is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts.
These cases are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.
From the time it purchased Airco in 1978 until this year, BOC had never had an adverse jury verdict returned against it in a case alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes.
On 28 October 2003, a jury in Madison County, Illinois, rendered a verdict against BOC and two co-defendants.
The jury awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former labourer who asserted that his idiopathic Parkinsons disease was attributable to his exposure to welding fumes over a period of years.
BOC believes that the verdict is inconsistent with the decisions rendered by juries in previous cases, is not supported by the existing scientific evidence and intends to pursue vigorously its post-trial and appeal rights.
BOC believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings related to alleged injury from exposure to welding fumes and intends to defend vigorously such claims.
Based on BOCs experience to date, together with BOCs current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted, and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited, The BOC Group Inc and The BOC Group plc.
The verdict arises primarily out of an alleged breach of a memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September 2001.
In March 2003, the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and severally liable for a total of US$174 million.
A bond for the full amount has been posted with the Court as part of the normal appeals process.
The company believes that the jurys verdict reflects a misunderstanding of the law and does not reflect the facts of any loss that may have been suffered by the plaintiff.
The company is challenging the verdict through the appropriate appeals process in the US and hence no provision has been made.
In addition, Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of the English Courts.
In a related proceeding in a US Bankruptcy Court, the UK administrators have obtained injunctive relief preventing the plaintiff in the Fluorogas litigation from commencing or continuing any action or proceeding enforcing any judgement against Fluorogas Limited in the US.
ERISA Litigation An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan the Plan.
The maximum potential liability could have reached US$116 million and any award would be paid out of Plan assets.
A provision of US$69 million has been made in the financial statements.

US accounting information a Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles and other US accounting information The financial statements of The BOC Group plc are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US US GAAP.
Set out below is a summary of the more significant adjustments which would be required if US GAAP had been applied, together with reconciliations of net profit, other comprehensive income and shareholders funds from a UK GAAP to a US GAAP basis.
Also presented on a US GAAP basis are a movement in shareholders funds, a consolidated cash flow statement, information on earnings per share, information on stock based compensation and details of recently issued US accounting pronouncements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998 accounted for under the purchase method has been eliminated against shareholders funds.
Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders funds is then charged against income.
The Group adopted FRS10 in 1999, which requires goodwill on subsequent acquisitions to be capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under US GAAP, following the adoption of SFAS142 Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, which was effective for the Group from 1 October 2002, goodwill continues to be capitalised, although amortisation is no longer charged to the income statement.
Instead, an annual impairment test is carried out, with any identified impairment loss recorded in the income statement.
Other intangible assets with a finite life continue to be amortised under both UK and US GAAP.
UK GAAP is highly prescriptive with regard to the recognition of intangible assets, although US GAAP rules result in the recognition of a greater amount of intangible assets.
Therefore, differences arise in the classification of some intangible assets and goodwill between UK and US GAAP.
Amortisation that has been charged against goodwill under UK GAAP is added back in the reconciliation to net income on a US GAAP basis.
Impairment of goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first financial year following an acquisition, and also when an indicator of impairment exists.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill impairment test, as required by SFAS142.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value.
Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit over the implied fair value of the goodwill.
Profit or loss on the partial disposal of Group companies Under UK GAAP UITF 31, gains on the partial disposal of Group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, such gains and losses are recorded in the income statement.
Deferred tax The Group adopted FRS19 Deferred tax in 2002 for UK GAAP purposes.
This requires that full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial statements.
The adoption of FRS19 has eliminated most of the differences that previously existed between UK GAAP and US GAAP in the accounting for deferred tax.
As a result, the tax adjustment now primarily relates to the deferred tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
Revaluation of fixed assets UK GAAP allowed for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount.
Any surplus or deficit to the extent that the revaluation reserve was in surplus on the revaluation was then taken directly to shareholders funds.
With the Groups adoption of FRS15 in 2000, the Group no longer revalues fixed assets.
Under US GAAP, revaluations of fixed assets are not permitted and, as a result, the reconciliation restates fixed assets to historical cost.
The depreciation charge and any write downs of previously revalued assets are adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets Under UK GAAP, a tangible fixed asset is reviewed for impairment if an indication exists that the asset may be impaired.
If necessary, an impairment loss is recorded.
A value in use calculation is carried out, based on discounted pre-tax future cash flows from the asset or income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Under US GAAP, a preliminary review of the tangible fixed asset is carried out using undiscounted future cash flows.
If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value, an impairment loss is required.
The impairment loss will be calculated using discounted future cash flows, or the assets market value.
Under US GAAP, the reversal of previously recognised impairment losses is not permitted.
Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP, when a decision has been taken to restructure, supported by a detailed formal plan and the creation of a valid expectation in those affected that the restructuring will take place, the necessary provisions are made for impairment of asset values together with severance and other costs.
Under US GAAP SFAS146, the requirements for charging restructuring costs to income are more prescriptive and all significant actions arising from the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
116 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 30.
US accounting information continued Pensions For UK GAAP reporting FRS17 Retirement benefits, the pension asset or liability in the balance sheet represents the difference between the market value of pension scheme assets at the balance sheet date and the present value of pension scheme liabilities at that date, net of deferred tax.
Under US GAAP SFAS87, plan assets are valued by reference to market-related value at the date of the financial statements.
Liabilities are assessed using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
FRS17 requires that past service costs are recognised in full in the period in which they become vested.
SFAS87 requires past service costs to be amortised over the remaining service lives of the employees to whom the amendments relate.
There is a significant difference in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses arising during the accounting period.
UK GAAP recognises the actuarial gains and losses in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses which exceed ten per cent of the value of the assets or liabilities at the start of the accounting period are amortised over the remaining service lives of scheme members.
Where an additional minimum liability exists under US GAAP, ie where the amount provided for any scheme does not cover the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for that scheme, this must be recognised in the balance sheet under SFAS87.
The adjustment resulting from the recognition of an additional minimum liability is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of the unrecognised prior service cost, after eliminating amounts previously shown as a prepaid benefit cost.
Any excess above these amounts is reported in comprehensive income.
Post retirement medical costs For UK GAAP reporting FRS17 Retirement benefits, the post retirement medical liability is discounted using the bond yield on suitable high quality corporate bonds, and disclosed net of related deferred tax.
For US GAAP SFAS106, the liabilities are assessed and discounted using the rates of return obtainable on high quality fixed income investments.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise largely from the treatment of actuarial gains and losses.
Securities investments Under UK GAAP, current asset investments of all types are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, or alternatively, at market value or at directorsvaluation.
Under US GAAP, securities which are determined to be  stated at fair value and any unrealised gains or losses included as a separate component of shareholders funds.
The deferred tax consequences of unrealised gains or losses are also charged or credited to shareholders funds.
Employee share option plans ESOPs and other share options Under UK GAAP, shares held by the ESOPs are recorded as fixed asset investments at cost, less a provision in accordance with UITF17.
No cost is accrued for share options awarded under employee share schemes where the price of the options is below the market value at the date of grant because they are considered non-compensatory.
Under US GAAP, these shares and other shares held in trust are recorded as treasury stock at cost in the balance sheet as a deduction from shareholders funds.
A charge is made against net income where options in executive share option plans become vested in accordance with APB Opinion 25.
Contingent consideration Under UK GAAP, contingent consideration is provided for as a liability when the likelihood of payment is considered to be probable.
Under US GAAP, contingent consideration is not recognised until the liability is determined beyond reasonable doubt.
The elimination of contingent consideration for US GAAP purposes also impacts on the value of goodwill arising on acquisitions, therefore there is no net impact on shareholders funds.
Financial instruments The Group enters into a number of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency and interest rate risks.
Under UK GAAP, such instruments are shown at their carrying value.
Under US GAAP, these instruments are marked to market and any change in value is recognised in either the income statement or through comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS133 depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
Accounting for swaps Under UK GAAP, gains or losses on closing out interest rate swap contracts taken to hedge the Groups fixed floating interest rate position can be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the remaining hedge period.
Share of results and net assets of joint ventures and associates The Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates as calculated under UK GAAP is shown within fixed asset investments.
For the purposes of the reconciliations set out below, the Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates has been adjusted to recognise a difference in the method of reporting profits under US GAAP.
Sale and leaseback transactions Under UK GAAP, any profit or loss on the sale and operating leaseback of fixed assets can generally be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the contract lease period.
Comprehensive income Under US GAAP, SFAS130 establishes requirements for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components revenue, expenses, gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements.
Components of comprehensive income for the Group determined on a UK GAAP basis include profit for the financial year, pension actuarial gains and losses, and foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Information regarding the Groups foreign currency translation gains and losses is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under UK GAAP on page 75.

The principal differences between the standards relate to classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under FRS1, cash flows are presented separately for:a operating activities:b dividends from joint ventures and associates:c returns on investments and servicing of finance:d tax paid:e capital expenditure and financial investment: f acquisitions and disposals:g equity dividends paid:h management of liquid resources:and i financing.
Under SFAS95, however, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported:a operating activities:b investing activities: and c financing activities.
Dividends from joint ventures and associates, cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance excluding dividends paid to minorities and tax paid under FRS1 would be included in operating activities under SFAS95:capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals would be included in investing activities under SFAS95:equity dividends would be included as a financing activity under SFAS95.
Under FRS1, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand.
Under SFAS95, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits but also includes cash equivalents which are short-term, highly liquid investments.
Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less come within this definition.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows under SFAS95.
2003 2002 2001 million million million Net cash provided by operating activities 562.4 620.2 631.2 Net cash used by investing activities 395.5 540.0 445.5 Net cash used by financing activities 286.4 122.7 225.6 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 119.5 42.5 39.9 Cash and cash equivalents at 1 October 181.9 259.0 305.6 Exchange and other movements 14.0 34.6 6.7 Cash and cash equivalents at 30 September 76.4 181.9 259.0 119 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 30.
US accounting information continued g Stock-based compensation For US reporting purposes the company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, in accounting for its share option plans.
By applying this statement the employee share schemes are deemed non-compensatory and therefore do not result in an expense for financial reporting purposes.
With the exception of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, grants of share options under executive schemes are at the market price of the companys shares at the time of grant.
The schemes are deemed compensatory and a charge is only recognised when certain performance conditions are met.
If compensation cost for the Groups share option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Groups net income under US GAAP would have been: 2003 2002 2001 million million million Reported net income 264.3 255.4 234.2 Add stock compensation expense recognised in accordance with APB25 net of related tax 2.5 Deduct stock compensation expense determined in accordance with SFAS123 net of related tax 7.1 6.9 6.8 Pro forma net income 257.2 251.0 227.4 2003 2002 2001 pence pence pence Earnings per share: Basic as reported 53.7 52.1 48.1 Basic pro forma 52.2 51.2 46.7 Diluted as reported 53.6 51.9 47.9 Diluted pro forma 52.2 51.0 46.5 The Black-Scholes model was used to measure the compensation expense under SFAS123.
The assumptions used for grants in 2003 included a dividend yield of 4.5 per cent 2002:4.0 per cent, 2001:4.0 per cent, expected share price volatility of 30.6 per cent 2002:31.0 per cent, 2001:30.0 per cent, a weighted average expected life of 5.0 years 2002:5.0 years, 2001:4.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.0 per cent 2002:4.9 per cent, 2001:5.1 per cent.
The weighted average interest rate is based on UK Gilts on the date of grant with a maturity similar to the related options.
h Recently issued accounting pronouncements implemented in the year SFAS142 Goodwill and other intangible assets SFAS142 became effective for the Group on 1 October 2002.
The statement removes the requirement to amortise goodwill and certain other intangible assets, and instead, requires an annual impairment review to be carried out on these items.
The impact of this standard is reflected in the US accounting information for the year to 30 September 2003.
The following table reflects net income for comparative periods prior to the adoption of SFAS142 as if the statements non-amortisation provisions had been adopted at the beginning of the respective periods.
2002 2001 million million Reported US GAAP net income 255.4 234.2 Add back: amortisation of goodwill charged against profit under both UK and US GAAP 3.7 3.4 charged against profit under US GAAP 7.2 7.9 US GAAP net income on SFAS142 basis 266.3 245.5 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended 30 September 2003 are as follows: Industrial Process and Special BOC Afrox Gas Solutions Products Edwards hospitals Gist Corporate Total million million million million million million million Balance at 1 October 34.3 86.4 120.3 6.1 0.7 3.0 250.8 Acquired during year 26.0 11.0 1.8 3.1 41.9 Disposed of during year 17.0 1.2 0.3 18.5 Exchange adjustment 0.8 2.3 0.1 2.7 0.3 4.0 Balance at 30 September 59.5 82.7 121.0 11.6 0.7 2.7 278.2 There were no impairments of goodwill during the year.
SFAS143 Accounting for asset retirement obligations SFAS143 became effective for the Group on 1 October 2002.
The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.
The standard has not had a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group in the year.
SFAS144 Accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets SFAS144 became effective for the Group on 1 October 2002.
The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, and it establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of.
120 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 30.
US accounting information continued SFAS146 Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities SFAS146 is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after 31 December 2002.
The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities.
It requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognised when the liability is incurred, rather than the date at which a commitment is made to an exit or disposal plan.
The impact of the standard is reflected in restructuring costs in the US GAAP reconciliation statements.
SFAS148 Accounting for stock-based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to SFAS123 In December 2002, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS148.
This statement provides alternative methods of transition for companies electing to adopt a fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
It also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, but makes no changes to the fair value principles of SFAS123.
The Group has complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS148 in note 30 g in the current year.
There is no impact on the results or financial position of the Group, as the Group applies APB Opinion 25 for the treatment of stock-based compensation.
SFAS149 Amendment of Statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities In April 2003, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS149.
This statement amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities.
This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after 30 June 2003, and has not had a material effect on the results or financial position in the current period.
Management does not believe that this statement will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
SFAS150 Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity In May 2003, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS150.
This statement establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
Some financial instruments will be classified as a liability, and others will be classified as equity.
This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after 31 May 2003 and has not had a material effect on the results or financial position in the current period.
EITF 00-21 Accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables In May 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF finalised amendments made to Issue 00-21 following a consensus being reached in November 2002.
Issue 00-21 addresses certain aspects of accounting by a seller, especially relating to the identification of single units of accounting for arrangements where the company will perform multiple revenue-generating activities.
Issue 00-21 is effective prospectively for arrangements initiated on or after 1 July 2003.
Issue 00-21 has not had a material impact on the Groups results and financial position in the current period.
Management does not believe that this issue will have a material effect on the results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
EITF 01-8 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease In May 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01-8.
Issue 01-8 provides guidance for determining whether an arrangement contains a lease that is within the scope of SFAS13 Accounting for Leases.
If it is determined that a lease exists, the lease and non-lease components of a combined sales arrangement must be accounted for separately.
Issue 01-8 is effective prospectively for arrangements initiated, modified, or acquired after 1 July 2003.
Management is currently evaluating the impact of EITF Issue 01-8 on its on-site supply agreements, and assessing the impact that this issue is likely to have in future periods.
Issue 01-8 has not had a material impact on the Groups results and financial position in respect of new or modified arrangements in the current period under US GAAP.
i Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet implemented FIN46 Consolidation of variable interest entities In January 2003, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation Number FIN 46.
In the current period, this interpretation is applicable to all variable interest entities created after 31 January 2003.
It will apply to all variable interest entities for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 2003.
This interpretation requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity if it holds a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur, or both.
This interpretation has not had a material effect on the results or financial position in the current period.
Management is currently assessing whether this interpretation is likely to have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
j Other information Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Post balance sheet events a On 17 November 2003, the Groups South African subsidiary company African Oxygen Limited announced that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited.
At that date, the estimated impact of the transaction was a reduction of a maximum of 1.5p in Group earnings per share for the year to 30 September 2003.
The sale remains subject to certain conditions, including clearance from the relevant competition and other regulatory authorities.
b An action was filed against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan the Plan in the US.
At the time of the preliminary announcement of the Groups results on 13 November 2003, no provision was made in respect of this case, as at that time the outcome of the litigation was uncertain and the amount of any loss could not be reliably estimated.
Subsequently, the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million, subject to approval by the court at a fairness hearing.
Under UK accounting principles FRS17 this amount has been recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account of the Group.
