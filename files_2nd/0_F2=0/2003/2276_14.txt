The gures for basic and diluted weighted average share capital exclude 400,000 shares in respect of which dividend entitlement has been waived on behalf of the Bodycote International Employee benefit Trust.
FRS 14 requires presentation of diluted EPS when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease net profit or increase net loss per share.
Net loss per share would only be increased by out-of-the-money options.
Since it seems inappropriate to assume that option holders would act irrationally, no adjustment has been made to diluted EPS.

Pension schemes The Group operated a number of pension schemes during the year.
The cost to the Group of these schemes was 4.9m 2002: 5.5m of which 3.3m 2002: 4.1m related to overseas arrangements.
UK Schemes The Group operates a funded dened benefit arrangement for UK employees in which the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The pension cost relating to the UK arrangement is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
The last actuarial assessment of the scheme was performed on 6 April 2002.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of each of the actuarial assessments are those relating to the rate of return on the investments 6.5%, the rate of increase in salaries 4.0% and the allowance 2.75% made for pension payment increases of 5% or retail price ination if less.
At the last actuarial valuation of the scheme, the market value of the assets totalled 26.8m.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 83% of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
At 6 April 2002, there was a surplus of 0.2m on the basis of the minimum funding requirement of the Pensions Act 1995.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 1,556,000, equivalent to 18% of pensionable pay after allowing for National Insurance rebates.
This contribution rate is to continue until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the scheme due as at 6 April 2005.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The transitional arrangements of the new accounting standard FRS 17 require disclosure of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2003 calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
They also require disclosure of the items which would appear in the profit and loss account and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses were the full requirements of FRS 17 in place.
For the purpose of these financial statements, all of these gures are illustrative only and do not impact on the actual 31 December 2003 balance sheet or on this years performance statements.
Assumptions The assets of the scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal actuarial assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 % p. a.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Currency exposures The Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of borrowings and to retain some potential for currency-related appreciation while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
The exposures as at 31 December 2003 were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets US $ Euro SEK Total m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling 1.1 1.4 0.1 2.6 Swiss Franc 0.1 0.1 Total 1.1 1.5 0.1 2.7 The exposures at 31 December 2002 for comparison purposes were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets US $ Euro SEK Total m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling 0.2 0.5 0.7 Czech Koruna 0.1 0.1 Swedish Krona 0.3 0.3 Total 0.2 0.9 1.1 The amounts shown in the tables above take into account the effect of any forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage these currency exposures.
