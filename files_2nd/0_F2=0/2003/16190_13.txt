This tax is payable in addition to mainstream UK corporation tax which is charged at a rate of 30% on UK taxable profits.
In 2002, none of the Groups upstream operations had a current liability to SCT due to the availability of capital allowances.
Overseas tax includes a charge of 2.7 million in respect of Cte dIvoire taxation arising in respect of the Espoir field.
Taxation on Profit on Ordinary Activities Continued b Factors affecting tax charge for period The difference between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax 30% plus the supplementary charge to corporation tax 10% to the profit before tax is as follows.
The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK.
Therefore the tax rates applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the reconciliation below is the standard rate of UK corporation tax plus the SCT.
In the period 17th April to 31st December 2002, the profits of the Company subject to SCT were nil due to the availability of capital allowances.
The 2002 reconciliation has therefore been made with reference to the prevailing mainstream UK corporation tax rate of 30%.

Earnings per Ordinary Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year after taxation of 10,920,541 2002 - 12,795,601 and 374,427,152 2002 - 359,324,277 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year after taxation as for basic earnings per share.
The number of shares outstanding however, is adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee and other share options are converted into ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares is increased by 2,071,203 2002 - 4,881,762 in respect of the share option scheme, resulting in a diluted weighted average number of shares of 376,498,355 2002 - 364,206,039.
The deferred cost of exploration represents the cost of pre-licence, licence acquisition, seismic and appraisal activity that is capitalised pending determination of commercial success through drilling, farmout or other joint venture arrangements.
If unsuccessful, the cost will be written off.
The costs at 31st December 2003, include 9,435,510 in respect of Block 28 and Sara West, Pakistan and Block 17 18, Bangladesh.
These costs have been carried by the Group for in excess of the three-year determination period recommended in the SORP.
The Directors consider the treatment appropriate because exploration and appraisal activities are ongoing and the determination process is not yet complete.
The Company has no intangible fixed assets.

Disposals during the year reflect the sale of Tullows onshore UK assets.
Effective 1st January 2003, following a review of the basis on which the Groups oil and gas properties are allocated to field cost centres, certain carrying values which were previously depreciated with reference to the production and reserves of specific reservoirs are now depreciated with reference to the aggregate production and reserves of the fields of which they are considered to form part.
The Directors consider that the revised basis applies the definition of a field more consistently across the Groups portfolio, and better reflects the economic reality of the Groups operations.
These are the first financial statements which reflect the revised basis, the effect of which in 2003 has been to decrease the depletion and amortisation charge by 4.5 million, relative to that computed for the year on the previous basis.

i Interest Rate Profile The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2003 was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 Cash at Bank at Floating Interest Rate 56,951 5,634 62,585 Cash at Bank on which no Interest is Received 1,404 2,329 368 4,101 Fixed Rate Debt 9,000 9,000 Floating Rate Debt 59,926 129 19,859 79,914 Net Debt Cash 10,571 129 11,896 368 22,228 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 63 12550 Tullow R&A03 p30-p72 aw 5 27 04 2:49 PM Page 64 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31st December 2003 i Interest Rate Profile continued The profile at 31st December 2002 for comparison purposes was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 Cash at Bank at Floating Interest Rate 40,835 987 41,822 Cash at Bank on which no Interest is Received 106 1,120 1,730 2,956 Fixed Rate Debt 17,200 413 9,333 26,946 Floating Rate Debt 68,610 189 9,320 78,119 Net Debt Cash 44,869 602 16,546 1,730 60,287 Cash at Bank at Floating Interest Rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance from periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to Sterling or US$ LIBOR.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US$ LIBOR, Sterling LIBOR or EURIBOR.
At 31st December 2002 there were committed funds under a credit facility of up to a maximum total commitment of 105 million, originally negotiated to fund the acquisition of the UK Southern Gas Basin interests.
From 31st December 2002 the total commitments reduce semi-annually, with maximum total commitments being 70 million at 31st December 2003.
The maximum debt availability under the credit facility is also determined semi-annually by reference to the net present value of the assets, using various technical and economic assumptions, subject to inclusion under the credit facility as well as certain other financial tests.
At 31st December 2003 the maximum debt availability was 66.6 million.
This credit facility incurs a commitment fee for undrawn balances of 50 basis points and interest on outstanding debt at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 140 basis points depending on utilisation.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31st December 2007, or such other time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is a requirement under the facility to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR.
In the above table for 2003, 9 million of the gross debt has been shown as fixed rate debt and is hedged through the application of interest rate swaps, which have the effect of limiting the interest rate exposure to LIBOR to a weighted average of 5.5% at 31st December 2003.
A further 7.8 million, shown as gross variable rate debt, is hedged through the application of interest rate caps and collars, which have the effect of limiting the interest rate exposure to LIBOR to not more than the weighted average of 7.2% at 31st December 2003.
The swaps, caps and collars extend over the life of the loan at varying notional principal amounts.
The interest rate swaps, caps and collars do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values.
In addition at 31st December 2003 there was a fully drawn borrowing facility of $15 million 8.4 million to fund development costs in Cte dIvoire.
This loan is repayable in instalments by 31st December 2006, however, based on current oil prices and production volumes, this loan is due to be repaid by 30th June 2004.
The interest charge is at US$ LIBOR plus 3.5%.
ii Maturity of Financial Liabilities The maturity of financial liabilities at 31st December 2003 is as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Within One Year 27,824 27,078 After One Year but within Two Years 35,990 41,458 After Two Years but Within Five Years 25,100 36,529 88,914 105,065 Debt in the balance sheet is stated net of unamortised arrangement fees.

In early 2004 Tullow drilled the Topaze South 1 well in Gabon.
No significant quantity of oil was found and the well was plugged and abandoned.
The information from this well will be further evaluated to better understand the geology of the Topaze discovery.
Tullow had a 100% carry in respect of the costs associated with the well as a result of a farm in agreement.
In December 2003 the Rasulpur well was spudded in Block 9, Bangladesh.
No significant moveable hydrocarbons were encountered and it was plugged and abandoned in mid February 2004.
Costs associated with the well of 1,066,207 at 31st December 2003 are included in intangible exploration assets costs of exploration pending determination.
In April 2004 Tullow reported that the Lalmai-3 well, in Block 9, Bangladesh had encountered potentially gas-bearing sands.
A production test will be undertaken to establish whether this gas is commercial.
In March 2004 Tullow announced that it has agreed to purchase ChevronTexacos 50% interest in the Orwell field, UK SNS, thereby increasing its stake to 100%.
Completion is expected during this summer with an effective date of 1st October 2003.
