AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements 60 Form 20-F Information 2003 Preparation of the Financial Statements and Directors Responsibilities The Directors are required by UK company law to prepare for each accounting period financial statements which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company as at the end of the accounting period and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to select and apply consistently suitable accounting policies and make reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates.
Applicable accounting standards also have to be followed and a statement made to that effect in the financial statements, subject to any material departures being disclosed and explained in the notes to the financial statements.
The Directors are required to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring proper accounting records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Company and prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Basis of Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Information The preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
No new accounting standards have been adopted this year.
