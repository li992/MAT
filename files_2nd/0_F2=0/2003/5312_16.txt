Electrocomponents plc 45 6Pension schemes The funding of the United Kingdom defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2003 amounted to 3.9m 2002: 3.6m.
The most recent valuation carried out in 2001 adopted a market-related approach to funding using the projected unit credit method.
The assumptions underlying the calculation of the liabilities were derived by reference to the gross redemption yield on long term gilts in conjunction with a pre-retirement equity enhancement, consistent with market conditions at the time of the valuation.
The principal assumptions applied in the 2001 valuation were therefore as follows: PAST FUTURE SERVICE SERVICE Investment return: before retirement 6.25% 6.5% after retirement 5% 5.25% Rate of future earnings inflation 4.25% 4.25% Rate of increase in pensions payment 2.5% 2.5% At the date of the 2001 valuation, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 169.8m, and the actuarial valuation of the assets covered 115% of the benefits that had accrued to the members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings giving a surplus of 22.1m.
Theexcess assets above the value of the liabilities are being eliminated by means of a reduction in the level of employer contributions to the Scheme.
The next valuation will be carried out no later than 31 March 2004.
Less formal funding updates are carried out each year and as at 31 March 2002 the surplus had reduced to 11m.
The results of the review as at 31 March 2003 are not yet finalised, but the position will have deteriorated further, with the scheme now in deficit.
The Company will be exploring whether it might be appropriate to increase contributions to some extent before the next full valuation.
The statutory minimum funding position of the Scheme remains good with a Minimum Funding Ratio estimated at between 120% and 125% as at 31 March 2003.
In addition to the UK scheme outlined above there are certain pension benefits provided on a defined contribution basis in Australia and NorthAmerica amounting to 0.7m 2002: 0.7m, on a defined benefit basis in Germany and Ireland amounting to 0.4m 2002: 0.4m, and via government schemes in France, Italy, Denmark and North Asia amounting to 1.6m 2002: 1.4m.
FRS 17 Disclosure A new pension accounting standard, FRS 17, was issued in November 2000.

The last actuarial valuations of the German and Irish schemes were carried out as at 31 March 2003 by the respective independent scheme actuaries in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.

Further information on Treasury and financial management is included in the Financial review.

2003 2002 At 31 March the financial liabilities of the Group comprised: M M Bank overdrafts repayable on demand unsecured 0.3 1.9 Current instalments of loans see note 24 29.0 19.7 Loans repayable between one and two years see note 24 39.9 Loans repayable between two and five years see note 24 1.9 50.0 Loans repayable in more than five years see note 24 2.5 2.8 73.6 74.4 The weighted average interest rate of the fixed-rate financial liabilities was 3.85% 2002: 3.85%.
The weighted average period to maturity for which the rates are fixed is 1,827 days 2002: 2,165 days.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings, bearing interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from overnight to 12 months by reference to the relevant inter-bank rate, plus overdraft balances.
b Borrowing facilities As at 31 March 2003 the Group had a 158.2m committed borrowing facility 2002: 176.1m denominated in US Dollars, of which 118.9m was undrawn 2002: 127.6m.
The undrawn amount will all expire in between one and two years.
c Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities It is considered that the fair value of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities approximates to their carrying value because of the short term nature of these amounts.
d Group hedging The Group hedges a very high percentage of the foreign currency exposure arising from its trading activities over the course of the next 12 months, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Company provides foreign currency inter-company loans to a number of its subsidiaries.
The foreign currency asset in the parent company is hedged in full using currency swaps.
This has the effect on a Group basis of converting an inter-company loan into a partial hedge against net foreign currency assets in the relevant currency.
The following table shows the nominal Sterling amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts in place at 31 March 2003 valued at the forward contracted rates and at the year end rates.
The difference between the two is the unrecognised gain or loss.
The hedges have no book value.

Throughout the year and as at the year end, the Group had one interest rate swap.
This converted fixed interest to floating interest on 7.2m Euro 5.0m.
The unrecognised gain arising on this interest rate swap as at 31 March 2003 was 0.3m 2002: nil.
