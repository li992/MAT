The true and fair override provisions of the Companies Act 1985 have been invoked in respect of investment properties see page 55.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
No profit and loss account is presented for National Express Group PLC as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
On acquisition of a business, the acquisition method of accounting is adopted, and the Group profit and loss account includes the results of subsidiary and business undertakings purchased during the year from the date of acquisition.
Purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
On the sale of a business, the Group profit and loss account includes the results of that business to the date of disposal.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of these associates results and reserves based on their latest accounts.
Turnover Turnover of the Group comprises revenue from road passenger transport, train passenger services, airport operations and related activities in the UK, North America and Australia.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.
UK Trains turnover includes agreed amounts attributed to the train operating companies TOCs, based principally on models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited in respect of passenger receipts.
In addition, franchise agreement receipts from the Strategic Rail Authority SRA and local Passenger Transport Executives PTEs within the West Midlands regions and Scotland are treated as turnover.
Franchise agreement payments to the SRA are recognised in operating costs.
UK Bus, UK Coach and Australia Bus turnover comprise amounts receivable generated from ticket sales.
The attributable share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred within creditors and released to the profit and loss account over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard.
North American Bus revenue from local authorities and similar contracts is recognised in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Goodwill In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 10, Goodwill and intangible assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 January 1998 is capitalised within intangible fixed assets and amortised over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years or the life of the rail franchise, if shorter.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been set off directly against reserves.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended in the following years accounts where necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post acquisition.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary, associate or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Leased assets Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases, which are those leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
54 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Stock Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Investment properties Certain of the Groups properties are held for long-term investment.
Investment properties are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 19, Accounting for investment properties whereby investment properties are revalued annually and the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to a revaluation reserve unless a deficit, or its reversal, on an individual investment property is expected to be permanent, in which case it is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year.
No depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of investment properties.
Although the Companies Act 1985 would normally require the systematic annual depreciation of fixed assets, the Directors believe that this policy of not providing depreciation or amortisation is necessary in order for the accounts to give a true and fair view, since the current value of investment properties, and changes in that current value, are of prime importance rather than a calculation of systematic annual depreciation.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reflected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Tangible fixed assets Investment properties and freehold land are not depreciated.
Other tangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Short leasehold properties over the period of the lease Long leasehold properties 15 to 40 years Freehold buildings 30 to 50 years Airport buildings, runways, etc 50 years Infrastructure assets 10 to 14 years Public service vehicles 2 to 15 years Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years The carrying value of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The Group has followed the transitional provisions in FRS 15, Tangible Fixed Assets, and will not revalue properties in the future, although as permitted by the standard, properties that have been revalued in the past have been retained at their existing book value.
The last valuation was at 31 December 1995.
Government Grants Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are capitalised and released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is expensed.
Pension costs Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis so that the costs of providing retirement benefits to employees are evenly matched, so far as is possible, to the service lives of the employees concerned.
Any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value of liabilities of the pension scheme is allocated over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
Differences between the amount charged in the profit and loss account and payments made to schemes are treated as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred, except where it is virtually certain that a franchise will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the profit and loss account over the life of the franchise.
Costs associated with the commencement of new contracts are expensed as incurred.
55 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers.
These insurance policies provide individual claim cover subject to excess limits and aggregate stop losses for total claims within the excess limits.
A provision is made on a discounted basis for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
Foreign currencies Group The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange for the year.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to reserves.
Company Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end except where forward cover has been arranged, in which case the forward rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences arising on the translation of foreign currency equity investments, and on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against these investments.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate exposures and fuel swaps to hedge fuel price exposures.
The Group considers these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
The Groups criteria for these swaps are that the instrument must be related to an asset, liability or future obligation and it must change the character of the interest rate or fuel price by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Differentials are recognised by accruing the net interest or fuel cost payable.
These swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
2 EXCHANGE RATES The most significant exchange rates to the pound for the Group are as follows: 2003 2003 2002 2002 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate US dollar 1.79 1.64 1.61 1.51 Australian dollar 2.37 2.53 2.86 2.78 Canadian dollar 2.32 2.31 2.54 2.47 If the results for the year ended 31 December 2002 were retranslated at the average exchange rates for the year ended 31 December 2003, North America would have achieved an operating profit before goodwill and exceptional items of 30.0m on turnover of 375.6m, and Australian Bus an operating profit before goodwill and exceptional items of 2.5m on turnover of 63.6m.
56 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 3 TURNOVER AND SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Due to the nature of the Groups businesses, the origin and destination of turnover is the same.
During the year, franchise agreement receipts from the SRA and PTEs amounted to 684.0m 2002: 634.9m in UK Trains.
In 2002, franchise agreement receipts totalling 62.5m were received from the Victoria Department of Public Transport in Australia Trains.
The goodwill impairment charge for 2002 relates to Australian Bus.
Exceptional items are included within external charges in note 5 and are analysed as follows: 2003 2002 m m Pre-contract bid costs : UK Trains 5.3 5.0 Included in the 2002 share of operating losses of associates of 6.6m is a 2.6m exceptional loss which comprises the Groups share of an impairment charge in the accounts for Altram LRT Limited following a review of the carrying value of its fixed assets.
Unallocated net liabilities comprise other investments, cash at bank and in hand, borrowings other than finance leases, deferred consideration payable, dividends payable and taxation.
The net liabilities in respect of the Groups investment in associates have been analysed according to the activities of the associate.

As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or on the sale of property where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
The total amount unprovided is 5.4m 2002: 5.4m.
Such tax would become payable only if the property was sold without it being possible to claim further rollover relief and this is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
In the overseas subsidiaries, the potential deferred tax assets exceed the deferred tax liabilities.
There is no recognition of the deferred tax asset in relation to the excess on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence to determine that it is recoverable.

11 DIVIDENDS 2003 2002 m m Ordinary interim paid of 8.5p per share 2002: 8.1p 11.5 10.7 Ordinary final proposed of 17.5p per share 2002: 16.4p 23.6 21.7 35.1 32.4 12 EARNINGS PER SHARE 2003 2002 Basic earnings loss per share 32.1p 80.0p Normalised basic earnings per share 61.4p 62.9p Diluted earnings loss per share 31.2p 80.0p Normalised diluted earnings per share 59.7p 60.3p Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year of 43.0m 2002: 105.3m loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the year, excluding those held by employees share ownership trusts which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
For 2002, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of calculating the diluted loss per share is identical to that used for the basic loss per share.
This is because the adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of FRS14, Earnings per share.
The reconciliation of weighted average number of ordinary shares is detailed as follows: Number Number of shares of shares 2003 2002 Basic weighted average shares 133,765,928 131,602,152 Adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares 3,951,354 5,622,274 Diluted weighted average shares 137,717,282 137,224,426 The normalised basic and normalised diluted earnings per share have been calculated in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share required by FRS 14 since, in the opinion of the Directors, they reflect the financial performance of the core business more appropriately.
The normalised basic and normalised diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2002 exclude the earnings from discontinued operations.
Normalised profits for the financial year are: 2003 2002 m m Profit loss for the financial year 43.0 105.3 Earnings from discontinued operations 0.1 Goodwill amortisation including impairment of 13.5m in 2002 45.7 58.7 Exceptional operating costs 5.3 5.0 Exceptional loss of associate see note 3 2.6 Loss on closure of businesses 126.1 Tax relief on goodwill and exceptional items 11.8 4.3 Normalised profits for the financial year 82.2 82.7 61 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 13 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill arising on all acquisitions, except Prism, is amortised evenly over the Directors estimate of its useful economic life of 20 years.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Prism in the year ended 31 December 2000 is amortised over the weighted average life of the franchises.
The Directors have reviewed the valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2003 and are of the opinion that the open market value of these properties at 31 December 2003 is fairly stated in these accounts.
