61 20 CREDITORS: AMOUNTS FALLING DUE AFTER ONE YEAR CONTINUED In December 2001, the Group committed to a finance lease, repayable within five years, relating to the purchase and sale-andleaseback of capital assets within the manufacturing plant.
Further details regarding this facility are given within Financial liabilities in note 22.
21 INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE The Group has an interest in the Pasteur Mrieux-OraVax joint venture the Joint Venture, whose principal business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell immunotherapeutic and preventative vaccines against H. pylori infection in humans.
The Joint Venture represents a collaboration between two partnerships, Mrieux-OraVax SNC and OraVax-Mrieux Co. incorporated in Delaware, US.
These partnerships were formed in March 1995 between Acambis Inc. and Aventis Pasteur.
The Joint Venture trades under the name of Pasteur Mrieux-OraVax and its accounting year-end is 31 December.
The R&D budgets of the two partnerships are established by joint committees in which each of the parties has an equal participation and role.
The parties pay approximately equal shares of the agreed budgets.
The following information is given in respect of the Groups share of the Joint Venture: 2003 2002 m m Loss before tax 0.1 0.2 Current assets 0.9 0.9 Liabilities due within one year 1.2 1.1 0.3 0.2 Due to the nature of this Joint Venture, being a collaboration between two partners, the following table provides an alternative analysis of the amounts shown above: 2003 2002 m m Share of cumulative amounts invested by the partners 16.3 18.2 Share of cumulative losses incurred by the partners 16.6 18.4 0.3 0.2 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups financial instruments comprise primarily cash and liquid resources, a finance lease facility, an overdraft facility, foreign currency contracts and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide working capital for the Groups operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups activities and involving the use of financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees the Groups objectives and policies for managing each of these risks.
Details of the Groups objectives and policies, both during the year and since the year end, are set out below, along with numerical disclosures for each category of financial instrument.
Except where indicated, these disclosures are indicative of the situation throughout the year.
The Groups short-term debtors and creditors are excluded from the disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group has subsidiaries that operate and trade in the US, with revenues, expenses and financing denominated principally in US dollars.
Through these overseas operations, the Group is subject to foreign exchange risk, including the risk of fluctuations in the Groups net investment in, and reported profits from, foreign subsidiaries when translated into sterling.
During 2003, the Group generated and retained more revenue in US dollars than it needed to fund expenditure denominated in US dollars.
In addition, a portion of the Groups sales is denominated in other currencies, primarily the euro.
The Group must therefore determine whether to hold these surplus funds in the currency in which they were earned, with reference to anticipated future expenditure patterns and relative returns on funds held in different currencies.
The Groups current policy is to hold surplus funds in sterling over the long term, which currently achieves a higher interest rate return, whilst mitigating the risk of fluctuations in the Groups net assets, when reported in sterling.
From time to time, the Group makes use of forward contracts in order to reduce uncertainty over the sterling value of anticipated US dollar receipts, thereby reducing uncertainty over the level of the Groups profits when reported in sterling.
During 2003, the Group took out forward contracts to sell $85m and buy sterling.
There were no forward contracts outstanding at the year end.
62 Notes to Group financial statements 31 DECEMBER 2003 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED During the year, the Group also used dual currency deposits for both euro and US dollar deposits, allowing an enhanced interest rate to be earned, which may, at maturity, be converted into sterling at the banks discretion, at a rate previously agreed.
The Group had a dual currency deposit of 17.5m outstanding at the year end.
Where Group companies have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currency, these balances are translated into that subsidiarys functional currency.
With the exception of gains and losses on those inter-company balances which are considered to be as permanent as equity and recorded in reserves, foreign exchange gains and losses arising are recorded immediately in the profit and loss account.
These amounts include sterling-denominated cash balances held in the US, US dollarand Euro-denominated balances held by the Company, and a US dollar-denominated overdraft facility held by a UK subsidiary.
In addition, the Group has other current assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which the Board does not consider to be significant.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.

It is the Groups policy to invest surplus cash on deposit, or in money market funds managed by professional money managers.
The performance of the investments is reviewed by management on a regular basis to ensure that competitive rates of return are being achieved, subject to the Boards requirement relating to the accessibility of funds and standing of financial institutions used see below.
The Board reviews regularly the financing facilities available to the Group to ensure competitive rates of interest are being obtained.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Board monitors the level of cash and liquid resources on a regular basis, and management on a daily basis, to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to meet its commitments as they fall due.
This is achieved through the production and review of cash forecasts, including sensitivity analyses.
Approximately half of the Groups cash and liquid resources are managed on a discretionary basis by a third party within strict parameters that have been set by the Board.
The remainder is invested in managed funds or invested in bank deposits within the parameters set by the Board.
These parameters include the requirement that the institutions used must have a minimum rating of Aa2 long-term or P-1 short term, and a maximum investment with any one counter party of 20m.
FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group had cash and liquid resources of 125.2m at 31 December 2003 2002 11.8m.
The majority of these resources are invested in managed funds or on bank deposit, denominated in sterling, US dollars and euros.
Approximately 50% of the Groups cash and liquid resources is available for use with a days notice with the remainder being invested on deposits of up to nine months.
During 2003, these funds achieved weighted average returns of 3.0% 2002 4.1% for funds invested in UK sterling, 1.4% 2002 1.9% for funds invested in US dollars, and 2.45% 2002 no balances held for funds invested in euros.
The Group also holds shares in Medivir AB see note 14b, an investment which does not subject the Group to interest rate risk as it has no maturity date.

During 2003, the weighted average interest payable on the facility was 1.5% 2002 2.0%.
At 31 December 2003, the Group also held a lease-finance facility, which matures within three years.
This $40m c. 22m lease-finance facility, arranged through Baxter International, Inc. Baxter, was approved by shareholders in December 2001 and is included in the financial statements within creditors.
No further draw downs were made from the facility during 2003 or 2002.
In January 2003, the interest percentage payable in respect of the facility was fixed at 6.25% until the end of the life of the lease, resulting in an interest charge of $1.4m 0.8m in 2003.
This interest charge was paid in cash during 2003.
The repayment schedule for the lease financing requires that interest only was repaid in 2003 and capital and interest are repayable over 2004 to 2006.
The Group had an option to repurchase all of the facilitys assets in December 2003, and on each anniversary thereafter, for the capital balance outstanding at that time, plus any accrued but unpaid interest due at the time, and a make-whole payment discounted to present value equal to the projected future interest stream payable to the end of the lease term.

The facility is denominated in US dollars.
