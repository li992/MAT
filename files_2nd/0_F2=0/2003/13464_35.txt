736505 2090 2 21 04 6:37 PM Page 135 Report of the Independent Auditors To the members of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.
We have audited the financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group which comprise the Group profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the Group cash flow statement, the Group statement of total recognised gains and losses, the reconciliation with Australian GAAP, and the related notes.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors remuneration report the auditable part.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards and Australian law are set out in the statement of directors responsibilities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for each companys members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 in respect of Rio Tinto plc and Section 308 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 in respect of Rio Tinto Limited and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission order dated 21 July 2003.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the companies have not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
The other information comprises only the items listed in the contents section of the Annual Report, excluding the 2003 audited financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects Rio Tinto plcs compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code, issued in June 1998, specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the companies or Groups corporate governance procedures or their risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited at 31 December 2003 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended: the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission order dated 21 July 2003: and those parts of the directors remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985.

These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to net earnings and shareholders funds that would be required under US GAAP is set out above.
Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements 137 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR UNITED STATES INVESTORS 736505 2100 2 21 04 6:40 PM Page 138 Supplementary information for United States investors continued RECONCILIATION WITH US GAAP CONTINUED Goodwill For 1997 and prior years, UK GAAP permitted the write off of purchased goodwill on acquisition, directly against reserves.
For acquisitions in 1998 and subsequent years, goodwill is capitalised and amortised over its expected useful life under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, goodwill is capitalised and, until 2001, was amortised by charges against income over the period during which it was expected to be of benefit, subject to a maximum of 40 years.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves in the UK GAAP financial statements was therefore reinstated and amortised, under US GAAP.
From 1 January 2002, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortised under US GAAP but are reviewed annually for impairment under FAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Goodwill amortisation of US$76 million charged against UK GAAP earnings for 2003 2002: US$90 million is added back in the US GAAP reconciliation.
Intangible assets under US GAAP The implementation of FAS 141 resulted in the reclassification of US$340 million from goodwill to finite lived intangible assets at 1 January 2002.
The accumulated cost relating to these intangible assets at 31 December 2003 was US$714 million and accumulated amortisation was US$432 million.
The total amortisation expense was US$47 million of which US$16 million is related to the amortisation of goodwill previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP now reclassified as finite lived intangible assets under US GAAP.
The remaining US$31 million relates to the amortisation of goodwill included as an asset on the UK GAAP balance sheet but now reclassified as finite lived intangible assets under US GAAP.
The estimated amortisation charge relating to intangible assets for each of the next five years is US$47 million.
Exchange differences included in earnings under US GAAP The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars and a significant proportion of the Groups US dollar debt is located in its Australian operations.
Under UK GAAP, this debt is dealt with in the context of the currency status of the Group as a whole and exchange differences reported by the Australian operations are adjusted through reserves.
US GAAP permits such exchange gains and losses to be taken to reserves only to the extent that the US dollar debt hedges US dollar assets in the Australian Group.
Exchange gains of US$1,019 million pre tax 2002: US$240 million, US$623 million net of tax and minorities 2002: US$177 million net of tax and minorities, on US dollar debt that do not qualify for hedge accounting under US GAAP have therefore been recorded in US GAAP earnings.
Mark to market of derivative contracts The Group is party to derivative contracts in respect of some of its future transactions in order to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates against the US dollar.
Under UK GAAP, these contracts are accounted for as hedges: gains and losses are deferred and subsequently recognised when the hedged transaction occurs.
However, certain of the Groups derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, principally because the hedge is not located in the entity with the relevant exposure.
Unrealised pre tax gains of US$182 million 2002: US$148 million, US$115 million after tax and minorities 2002: US$104 million after tax and minorities, on such derivatives have therefore been recorded in US GAAP earnings.
Realised gains of US$105 million pre tax 2002: US$9 million pre tax, US$75 million after tax and minorities 2002: US$6 million after tax and minorities, which have been capitalised under UK GAAP have also been recorded in earnings under US GAAP.
Adjustments to asset carrying values Following the implementation of FRS 11 in 1998, impairment of fixed assets under UK GAAP is recognised and measured by reference to the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by an income generating unit.
Under US GAAP, impairment is recognised only when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the income generating unit.
Where an asset is found to be impaired under US GAAP, the amount of such impairment is generally similar under US GAAP to that computed under UK GAAP, except where the US GAAP carrying value includes additional goodwill.
Under UK GAAP, impairment provisions may be written back in a future year if the expected recoverable amount of the asset increases.
Such write backs of provisions are not permitted under US GAAP.
Therefore, any credits to UK GAAP earnings resulting from such write backs are reversed in the reconciliation to US GAAP.
Pensions post retirement benefits Under UK GAAP, post retirement benefits are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24.
The expected costs under defined benefit arrangements are spread over the service lives of employees entitled to those benefits.
Variations from the regular cost are spread on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period adjusted for the amortisation of the surplus arising when FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, was adopted.
The charge is further adjusted to reflect the cost of benefit improvements and any surpluses deficits that emerge as a result of variances from actuarial assumptions.
For US purposes, only those surpluses deficits outside a ten per cent fluctuation corridor are spread.
The reductions in shareholders funds at 31 December 2003 and 2002 also include the effect of the US GAAP requirement to make immediate provision for pension fund deficits through other comprehensive income.
The provision reflects the reduction in equity values over recent years.
Mandatory implementation of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, has been delayed until 2005 but additional disclosures are required for 2001 onwards, which are included in note 41 to the financial statements.
Exploration and evaluation Under UK GAAP, expenditure on a project can be carried forward after it has reached a stage where there is a high degree of confidence in its viability.
US GAAP does not allow expenditure to be carried forward unless the viability of the project is supported by a final feasibility study.
In addition, under UK GAAP, provisions made against exploration and evaluation in prior years can be reversed when the project proceeds to development, to the extent that the relevant costs are recoverable.
US GAAP does not allow such provisions to be reversed.
Share option plans Under UK GAAP, no cost is accrued where the option scheme applies to all relevant employees and the intention is to satisfy the share options by the issuance of new shares.
Under the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the fair value of the options is determined using an option pricing model.
138 Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR UNITED STATES INVESTORS 736505 2100 2 21 04 6:41 PM Page 139 RECONCILIATION WITH US GAAP CONTINUED Effect of historical average commodity prices in ore reserve determination For UK and Australian reporting, the Groups ore reserve estimates are determined in accordance with the JORC code and are based on forecasts of future commodity prices.
During 2003, the SEC formally indicated that, for US reporting, historical price data should be used.
The application of historical prices has led to reduced ore reserve quantities for US reporting purposes for certain of the Groups operations, which results in lower earnings for US reporting, largely as a result of higher depreciation charges.
Details of the differences in ore reserves used for US reporting are set out on page 147.
Higher cost of sales resulting from acquisition accounting Under UK GAAP, the inventories of acquired companies are valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, such inventories are recognised at the time of acquisition on the basis of expected net sales proceeds.
There is no effect on 2003 earnings.
Provisions for close down and restoration costs FAS 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations has been implemented with effect from 1 January 2003.
Under this US standard, provision is made in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
The costs so recognised are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset.
In each subsequent year, the discount applied to the provision unwinds, resulting in a charge to the profit and loss account for the year and an increase in the present value of the provision.
This accounting treatment is broadly similar to Rio Tintos established policy under UK GAAP.
Consequently, the pre tax adjustment to the Provision for close down and restoration costs included in the above reconciliation at 31 December 2002 has now been substantially reduced through the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle.
Start up costs Under US GAAP, Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start up Activities, requires that the costs of start up activities are expensed as incurred.
Under UK GAAP, some of these start up costs qualify for capitalisation and are amortised over the economic lives of the relevant assets.
Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, ordinary dividends are recognised in the financial year in respect of which they are paid.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are not recognised until they are formally declared by the board of directors or approved by the shareholders.
Other Other adjustments include amounts relating to differences between UK and US accounting principles in respect of depreciation of mining assets, revenue recognition and unrealised holding gains and losses.
Depreciation of mining assets Under UK GAAP, mining assets are fully depreciated over their economic lives or the remaining life of the mine if shorter.
In some cases, mineral resources that do not yet have the status of reserves are taken into account in determining depreciation charges, where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be mined economically.
For US GAAP, only proven and probable reserves are taken into account in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges.
As a result, adjustments have been made to depreciation reducing US GAAP pre tax earnings by US$59 million 2002: US$10 million.
Revenue recognition Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101 SAB 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements has the result that, in some cases, sales recorded as revenue under UK GAAP are deferred and are not recognised as revenue under US GAAP until a future accounting period.
Occasionally, sales of goods recorded as revenue for UK GAAP purposes may be kept in store by Rio Tinto at the request of the buyer.
Under US GAAP, such transactions cannot be recognised as revenue unless the goods are physically segregated from the suppliers other inventory and certain additional criteria are met.
In 2003, such timing differences resulted in a reduction in US GAAP pre tax earnings of US$17 million 2002: US$4 million increase.
Unrealised holding gains and losses UK GAAP permits current asset investments to be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, FAS 115 requires that unrealised holding gains and losses on investments classified as available for sale are reported within a separate component of shareholders funds and excluded from earnings until realised.
Taxation Under UK GAAP, provision for taxes arising on remittances of earnings can only be made if the dividends have been accrued or if there is a binding agreement for the distribution of the earnings.
Under US GAAP, provision must be made for tax arising on expected future remittances of past earnings.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is not provided in respect of upward fair value adjustments to tangible fixed assets and inventories made on acquisitions.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax must be provided on all fair value adjustments to non monetary assets recorded on acquisition with a consequential increase in the amount allocated to mining properties or goodwill as appropriate.
Under UK GAAP, tax benefits associated with goodwill charged directly to reserves in 1997 and previous years, must be accumulated in the deferred tax provision.
This means that the tax benefits are not included in earnings until the related goodwill is charged through the profit and loss account on disposal or closure.
For US GAAP, no provision is required for such deferred tax because the goodwill that gave rise to these tax benefits was capitalised and gives rise to amortisation charges against profit.
Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with FRS 1 revised presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, however, there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under US GAAP, tax paid and interest would form part of operating cash flow.
Under UK GAAP, cash for the purposes of the cash flow statement is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less bank borrowings from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand.
Deposits are repayable on demand if they can be withdrawn at any time without notice and without penalty or if a maturity or period of notice of not more than 24 hours or one working day has been agreed.
Under US GAAP, cash equivalents comprise cash balances and current asset investments with an original maturity of less than three months and exclude bank borrowings repayable on demand.
Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements 139 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR UNITED STATES INVESTORS 736505 2100 2 21 04 6:41 PM Page 140 Supplementary information for United States investors continued RECONCILIATION WITH US GAAP CONTINUED Adjusted earnings As permitted under UK GAAP, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share have been presented excluding the impact of exceptional items to provide a measure that reflects the underlying performance of the Group.
This is in addition to the presentation of earnings and earnings per share, which include the exceptional items.
In accordance with US GAAP, earnings and earnings per share have been presented based on US GAAP earnings, without adjustment for the impact of exceptional items.
Such additional measures of underlying performance are not permitted under US GAAP.
Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued interpretation No.
46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46.
Under FIN 46, certain entities labelled Variable Interest Entities VIE, must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity.
The primary beneficiary is generally defined as the party exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards arising from the VIE.
For VIEs in which a significant variable interest is held that is not a majority interest, certain disclosures are required.
Full implementation of this interpretation is required in the Groups financial statements for the year to 31 December 2004.
The Group has a 20 per cent general partnership interest in the Colowyo limited partnership, which was acquired for US$25 million in December 1994.
This joint venture may fall within the definition of a Variable Interest Entity set out in FIN 46.
The Colowyo joint venture produces coal, which is sold under long term contracts.
Colowyos total sales revenues for 2003 were US$101 million and its total assets as at 31 December 2003 were US$100 million.
It is included in the Group accounts on the equity accounting basis and the carrying value of the net investment at 31 December 2003 was US$27 million under US GAAP.
Colowyo has bonds in issue with outstanding capital of US$163 million at 31 December 2003.
These are repayable by instalments up to 2016 with interest at rates between 9.56 per cent and 10.19 per cent per annum.
The bonds are to be serviced and repaid exclusively out of the net revenues from certain specified sales contracts relating to coal supplies by Colowyo.
The bondholders bear the risks of loss that might arise if the revenues are interrupted due to failure of the purchasers or force majeure.
The Rio Tinto Group is responsible under a management contract in which it agreed, for the sole and exclusive benefit of the bondholders, to cause Colowyo to perform its obligations under the specified coal sales contracts.

b During 2003, accrued gains of US$34 million relating to derivatives that were not designated as hedges under FAS 133 were realised on maturity of the contracts.
c The fair value of net derivative liabilities designated as cash flow hedges under FAS 133 reduced by US$148 million during 2003, resulting in a closing asset balance related to cash flow hedging activities of US$88 million in OCI.
These cash flow hedges hedge the Groups exposure to the US dollar in relation to future trading transactions.
The Group expects to reclassify US$43 million of this amount as increases in earnings over the next 12 months as these contracts and the transactions which they hedge mature.
As at 31 December 2003, the Group had US$144 million of cash flow hedge derivative assets and US$56 million of cash flow hedge derivative liabilities.
The cash flow hedges extend to 2010. d Certain of the Groups derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, principally because the hedge is not located in the entity with the exposure.

The measurement date used to establish year end asset values and benefit obligations was 30 September 2003.
The previous measurement date, used to determine 2003 costs, was 30 September 2002.
Benefits under the major pension plans are principally determined by years of service and employee remuneration.
The Groups largest defined benefit pension plans are in the UK, Australia and the US and a description of the investment policies and strategies followed is set out below.
In the UK and the US, the investment strategy is determined by the pension plan trustee and investment committee respectively, after consulting the company.
Agreed investment policies aim to ensure that the objectives are met in a prudent manner, consistent with established guidelines.
The investment objectives include generating a return that exceeds consumer price and wage inflation over the long term.
Ranges for the proportions to be held in each asset class have been agreed: a substantial proportion of the assets is invested in a spread of domestic and overseas equities, with a smaller proportion in fixed and variable income bonds, cash and, in the US, real estate.
Risk is managed in various ways, including identifying investments considered to be unsuitable and placing limits on some types of investment.
In particular, the funds are not allowed to invest directly in any Rio Tinto Group company.
In Australia, the investments reflect the various defined benefit and defined contribution liabilities and are primarily in Australian and overseas equities and fixed interest stocks.
At 30 September 2003, funded pension plans held assets invested in the following proportions: UK US Group target target actual Equities 45%-85% 65% 65% Debt securities 15%-45% 30% 27% Real estate 5%3% Other 0%-10% 5% plus or minus 5% The split of pension investments at 30 September 2002 is not readily available.
However, a summary as at 31 December 2002 is set out in the FRS17 transitional disclosures on page 126.
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long term return of the major asset classes equity, debt, real estate and other weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
Pension plan funding policy is based on annual contributions at a rate that is intended to fund benefits as a level percentage of pay over the working lifetime of a plans participants, subject to local statutory minimum contribution requirements.
Details of anticipated contributions in 2004 are set out in the FRS 17 transitional disclosures on page 126.
Assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and the end of year benefit obligation for the major pension plans varied between the limits shown below.
The average rate for each assumption has been weighted by benefit obligation.
The assumptions used to determine the end of year benefit obligation are also used to calculate the following years cost.
2003 cost Year end benefit obligation Discount rate 5.8% to 12.0% Average: 6.7% 5.4% to 9.5% Average: 5.9% Long term rate of return on plan assets 6.5% to 12.0% Average: 7.2% 6.3% to 11.0% Average: 6.6% Increase in compensation levels 3.3% to 11.0% Average: 4.8% 3.7% to 6.5% Average: 4.2% The actuarial calculations in respect of the UK plans assume a rate of increase of pensions in payment of 2.6 per cent per annum.
This assumption is consistent with the expected rates of return and salary increase assumptions in the respective valuations.
Appropriate assumptions were made for plans in other countries.
Other post retirement benefits are provided to employees who meet the eligibility requirements, and their beneficiaries and dependants, through unfunded self insurance arrangements.
The majority of these plans are for employees in the United States.
The plans are non contributory, although some contain an element of cost sharing such as deductibles and co-insurance.
The weighted average assumptions used in determining the costs and year end benefit obligation for the major post retirement benefit plans other than pension plans were as below: Cost Year end benefit obligation Discount rate 6.5% 2002: 6.5% 6.1% 2002: 6.5% Healthcare cost trend rate 8.0% reducing to 5.0% by 11.2% reducing to 4.7% by 2009 2002: 8.5% reducing 2011 2002: 8.0% reducing to 5.0% by 2009 to 5.0% by 2009 144 Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR UNITED STATES INVESTORS 736505 2100 2 21 04 6:42 PM Page 145 Components of net benefit expense Pension benefits Other benefits 2003 2002 2003 2002 US$m US$m US$m US$m Defined benefit plans Service cost 123 97 9 7 Interest cost on benefit obligation 210 207 28 25 Expected return on plan assets 252 258 Net amortisation and deferral: transitional obligation 10 10 recognised losses gains 6 10 5 8 prior service cost recognised 23 22 1 1 Total net amortisation and deferral 19 2 6 9 Net periodic benefit cost 100 48 31 23 Curtailment charge credit 8 3 2 Net benefit expense 100 56 28 25 The 2003 pension cost recognised for defined contribution plans, of US$9 million 2002: US$5 million, is included in the above.

The accumulated benefit obligations for pension plans at 30 September 2003 amounted to US$3,973 million.
At 30 September 2002, the corresponding total of accumulated benefit obligations was US$3,025 million.
For each plan, where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the assets and this deficit is greater than the amount provided, an increase in the provision is charged to other comprehensive income.
To the extent that the deficit relates to previous benefit improvements an intangible asset is created which reduces the charge to other comprehensive income.

The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit Medicare Part D and a federal subsidy for sponsors of post retirement healthcare plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Specific guidance on the accounting impact of this Act is pending and therefore, in line with the provisions of FSP FAS 106-1 the figures disclosed in this note for post retirement healthcare do not reflect the effects of the Act on any of the US post retirement healthcare arrangements.
When final guidance on accounting for the Act is issued, changes to the post retirement healthcare information disclosed in this note may be required.

Material changes are shown below.
The ore reserve figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2003.
Metric units are used throughout.
The figures used to calculate Rio Tinto's share of reserves are often more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.

MINING AND TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS Alumina Aluminium oxide.
It is extracted from bauxite in a chemical refining process and is subsequently the principal raw material in the electro-chemical process by which aluminium is produced.
Anode and cathode copper At the final stage of the smelting of copper concentrates, the copper is cast into specially shaped slabs called anodes for subsequent refining to produce refined cathode copper.
Bauxite Mainly hydrated aluminium oxides AL O.
Principal ore of alumina, the raw material from which 2 3 2 aluminium is made.
Beneficiated bauxite Bauxite ore that has been treated to remove waste material to improve its physical or chemical characteristics.
Bioleaching The deliberate use of bacteria to speed the chemical release of metals from ores.
Block caving An underground bulk mining method.
It involves undercutting the orebody to induce ore fracture and collapse by gravity.
The broken ore is recovered through draw points below.
Borates A generic term for mineral compounds which contain boron and oxygen.
Cathode copper Refined copper produced by electrolytic refining of impure copper or by electrowinning.
Classification Separating crushed and ground ore into portions of different size particles.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration process, such as flotation or gravity concentration, which involves separating ore minerals from unwanted waste rock.
Concentrates require subsequent processing such as smelting or leaching to break down or dissolve the ore minerals and obtain the desired elements, usually metals.
Cutoff grade The lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic to process.
It is used in the calculation of the quantity of ore present in a given deposit.
Dor A precious metal alloy which is produced by smelting.
Dor is an intermediate product which is subsequently refined to produce pure gold and silver.
DWT Dead weight tons is the combined weight in long tons 2,240 pounds weight of cargo, fuel and fresh water that a ship can carry.
Flotation A method of separating finely ground minerals using a froth created in water by specific reagents.
In the flotation process certain mineral particles are induced to float by becoming attached to bubbles of froth whereas others, usually unwanted, sink.
Grade The proportion of metal or mineral present in ore, or any other host material, expressed in this document as per cent, grams per tonne or ounces per ton.
Head grade The average grade of ore delivered to the mill.
Ilmenite Mineral composed of iron, titanium and oxygen.
Metallurgical coal Also referred to as coking coal.
By virtue of its carbonisation properties, it is used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel making process.
Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements 151 DEFINITIONS AND EXCHANGE RATES 736505 3010 2 21 04 6:48 PM Page 152 Definitions continued Mineral resource Material of intrinsic economic interest occurring in such form and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
Ore A rock from which a metal s or mineral s can be economically extracted.
Ore milled The quantity of ore processed.
Ore hoisted The quantity of ore which is removed from an underground mine for processing.
Ore reserve That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
Pressure oxidation A method of treating sulphide ores.
In the case of refractory gold ores, the object is to oxidise the sulphides to sulphates and hence liberate the gold for subsequent cyanide leaching.
The technique involves reaction of the ore with sulphuric acid under pressure in the presence of oxygen gas.
Probable ore reserves Reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proved reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proved reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Proved ore reserves Reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes: grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
Rock mined The quantity of ore and waste rock excavated from the mine.
In this document, the term is only applied to surface mining operations.
Rutile A mineral composed of titanium and oxygen TiO.
2 Steam coal Also referred to as steaming coal, thermal coal or energy coal.
It is used as a fuel source in electrical power generation, cement manufacture and various industrial applications.
Stripping ratio The tonnes of waste material which must be removed to allow the mining of one tonne of ore. Solvent extraction and Processes for extracting metal from an ore and producing pure metal.
First the metal is leached into electrowinning SX-EW solution: the resulting solution is then purified in the solvent extraction process: the solution is then treated in an electro-chemical process electrowinning to recover cathode copper.
Tailing The rock wastes which are rejected from a concentrating process after the recoverable valuable minerals have been extracted.
Titanium dioxide A feedstock rich in titanium dioxide, produced, in Rio Tintos case, by smelting ores containing feedstock titanium minerals.
4 Notes Ore reserve estimates in this document have been adjusted for mining losses and dilution during extraction.
Metal grades have not been adjusted for mill recoveries, but mill recoveries are presented in the table of reserves and are taken into consideration in the calculation of Rio Tintos share of recoverable metal.
Unless stated to the contrary, reserves of industrial minerals and coal are stated in terms of recoverable quantities of saleable material, after processing or beneficiation losses.
Reserve and resource terminology used in this document complies in general with the requirements of the Australian Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.

In 2003, the world economy ended in better shape, with growth in China being a significant factor.
Together with the cyclical upswing in the US and in other developed economies, significant pressure is being exerted on mineral raw materials markets.
Iron ore and coking coal are particularly short whilst copper is getting rapidly tighter.
Deferral of production at Grasberg due to the slippage event will, however, affect copper production.
The major economic uncertainty ahead lies in the currency markets, both with respect to possible impacts on our costs expressed in US dollars, and the responses which further moves in exchange rates might provoke from economic policy makers.
Our natural hedge against the weakening US dollar provided by strengthening prices for our diverse product range protects us to some extent, as does our policy of borrowing at floating interest rates, but the relative value of the US dollar remains a key uncertainty.
Considering the expansion plans we have announced, and the strong outlook for a number of our products on the back of growth in China, we see a promising medium to long term outlook, with our performance underpinned by some of the best mining assets in the world.
Finally, whatever the mix of challenge and opportunity, I am delighted to be supported by a very strong management team and employees of the highest calibre.
In the end, it is the quality of people that makes the difference in delivering long term value.

6 Rio Tinto 2003 Annual review 259 367 502 452 499 Rock art preserved in port expansion The Burrup Peninsula in north west Australia, site of Hamersley Irons Dampier port for export of iron ore, lies within one of the richest concentrations of Aboriginal rock art in the world.
The diversity, artistry and cultural information displayed by the images places the area amongst world class heritage sites.
As part of Hamersley Irons expansion of the port, extensive heritage surveys were conducted with the help of local Aboriginal groups and their representatives.
Some 600 petroglyphs engraved rock art were recorded.
As work progressed, design changes were made to project plans to accommodate rock art by shifting the rail spur location and redesigning the construction camp and access road.
However, not all engraved boulders could be protected, and Hamersley staff worked closely with the relevant Aboriginal groups the Ngaluma Injibandi, Coastal Yaburara Mardudhunera and Wong-Goo-Tt-Oo - to relocate a number of rock art panels so that the port upgrade works could proceed.
The Western Australian Minister for Indigenous Affairs consented to the disturbance of eight identified sites involving some 41 boulders with petroglyphs on them.
Some of these rocks were too massive and deeply buried to be shifted, and so a method of rock separation was devised that uses the pressure of expanding chemical compounds to ease the engraved rock apart from the bedrock base.
All the resulting panels have been relocated to positions away from the construction site, but as close to their original context as possible.
Some engravings mark the location of important ethnographic sites, only able to be viewed by specific groups these have been fenced and protected, and in some cases hidden from view, for the duration of the construction project.

Through Kennecott Energy Corporation KEC, RTE is exploring participation in the US Governments FutureGen project to develop a near zero emissions coal power plant.
The US$1 billion project would turn coal into a hydrogen gas rather than burning it directly.
The combined electricity and hydrogen production would virtually eliminate harmful emissions including greenhouse gases.
The carbon dioxide would be captured as part of the process and injected into suitable geological formations underground for long term storage sequestration.
Hydrogen is seen as a fuel of the future in automotive and other applications.
Knowledge from the prototype power station is expected to help turn the publics perception of coal from a polluting energy resource into an environmentally benign one.
Bret Clayton, president and CEO of KEC, said: We believe that geological storage of CO is a vital component in addressing emissions.
2 It is essential we win the debate about the acceptability of capture and CO storage if coal is to remain in the energy mix in the very long term.
2 Rio Tinto will also support and promote international collaboration on carbon capture and storage as we see this as essential in bringing forward commercialisation of this new technology.

Through its award winning reclamation and rehabilitation projects, RBM is providing valuable skills transfer for local companies who aspire to be world class in their field.
The company, Dune Rehabilitation Services Pty Ltd, takes over rehabilitation services for the mine, progressively reclaiming disturbed land as it is mined.
The service includes providing materials, labour, supervision and equipment.
Rehabilitation comprises the erection and maintenance of windbreaks, sowing seeds, planting commercial plantations and controlling weeds.
In the past, a company supplied workers while RBM personnel supervised tasks and teams.
This responsibility now falls to Dune Rehabilitation.
RBM manager mine services, Herman Kok, says the annual target area will cover 160 to 200 hectares.
RBMs expected improvement in productivity and efficiency should translate into lower costs per unit area of rehabilitated land.
More importantly, empowerment can develop the contracted company into a fully fledged service provider which, in turn, will grow and offer services to other companies.
Seedlings thrive between windbreaks on rehabilitated land at Richards Bay Minerals, South Africa.
New plantations provide income to local communities.

Alumina is the intermediate product for making aluminium metal from the ore source, bauxite.
In a transaction that forges a long term relationship, Norwegian industrial group Norsk Hydro will buy 500,000 tonnes of alumina per year for more than 20 years from Comalco.
The product, from Queensland Alumina Limited and the new Comalco Alumina Refinery, both in Gladstone, will supply Norsk Hydros aluminium smelters in Australia and elsewhere.
Starting with a volume of 300,000 tonnes in 2005, Comalco will provide Norsk Hydro with 500,000 tonnes of alumina annually from 2006 through to 2030.
The agreement allows for volume increases during the duration of the contract.
Sam Walsh, chief executive, Aluminium, said: This agreement is in line with Comalcos strategy to grow our alumina business.
It is part of our plan to maximise the value of Comalcos vast bauxite deposits at Weipa in north Queensland.
The agreement underpins Comalcos decision to build the new 1.4 million tonnes per year alumina refinery, the first greenfields alumina refinery to be built anywhere in the world in the last 20 years, which is scheduled to make its first shipment in early 2005.

On that day in 1903, corporate documents were signed that created The Utah Copper Company.
The arrival of Utah Copper Companys first two and a half cubic yard steam shovels in Bingham Canyon in 1906 triggered the beginning of a 100 year industrial development, which became one of the most remarkable engineering feats in America.
Marking the centenary, Bill Champion, president and CEO of KUC, said: What has happened during the past 100 years far surpassed even the most optimistic visions of the founders who promoted the concept of mass production techniques for a low grade deposit of copper ore. At that time, it was a totally new way of doing things.
The mine has produced more copper than any mine in the world.
Bingham Canyons ore has yielded more than 16 million tonnes of copper, 23 million ounces of gold, 190 million ounces of silver and 0.4 million tonnes of molybdenum whose cumulative value far exceeds the yields of the Comstock Lode, Klondike and California Gold Rushes combined.
Kennecott entered the Bingham Canyon story in 1923 when it acquired control of The Utah Copper Company.
KUC was subsequently purchased in 1989 by Rio Tinto.

Promoting pride of product Building on its previous efforts, Rio Tinto Diamonds RTD India office launched a new certification process to raise standards among its customers diamond and jewellery manufacturing firms regarding the quality of their work and the management of issues relating to environment, health, safety and social responsibility.
Called the Business Excellence Model BEM, it is a set of standards which can be used for accreditation of customers.
RTD unveiled the BEM at an event in Mumbai Bombay in August 2003.
It focuses on issues such as the use of personal protective equipment, hygiene and housekeeping, paying statutory minimum wages, employing no child labour, providing employee facilities, and preventing pollution.
Assuring operational quality is centred on having a customer focus and customer satisfaction feedback.
KPMG in India has been awarded the responsibility of auditing RTDs customer businesses against the BEM standards.
All RTDs Indian customers have been invited to participate in the programme.
Once standards are met, a certificate of accreditation will be awarded.
This should help customers in their marketing activities as well as providing assurance to RTD that its products are processed by firms operating to acceptable standards of social responsibility.

18 Rio Tinto 2003 Annual review Safer driving in Africa In mineral exploration, the use of vehicles represents the greatest safety risk and vehicle and driver management is a high priority.
The Africa Europe division operates across eight countries with variable driving cultures, terrains and weather conditions.
Safety rules, when applied in Africa, often conflict with accepted practice: riding in the back of pick up trucks is customary, a shortage of vehicles often means overloading and empty vehicles are seen as a wasted resource.
Vehicle management plans have been introduced, with a clear formalisation of procedures, requiring all staff who drive at work to sign up.
There was formal training for all drivers.
Analysis showed a worrying number of accidents outside normal hours so a satellite tracking system was tested in Botswana.
The system generates maps that show the time and route of all journeys including those to remote camps, allowing managers to monitor speeds, routes and distances.
Drivers have reacted positively to the system and adjusted their driving habits, leading to a reversal of a growing number of incidents since 2000 and a notable reduction in 2003 from 2002.
When Rio Tintos corporate safety standards were issued, very few changes were required to the system in place, except for increased frequency of training and assessment of drivers.
The tracking system is being introduced elsewhere in Africa.

In 2003, Lihir commissioned a geothermal power station that is expected to save US$2 million a year on energy costs.
There are plans to expand the use of this natural energy, with a 30 megawatt plant scheduled to be brought on line in 2005.
With ore reserves partly situated in geothermal zones, Lihir has managed the geothermal forces in ways that allow mining to take place.

The power plant requires more than 100 tonnes of steam per hour to operate at maximum capacity.
The six megawatts of power produced represent ten per cent of the operations total requirements.
Lihir managing director Neil Swan said: The company has harnessed a low cost, renewable power supply.
Local businesses have been employed in the construction of the power station.

Openness and accountability Rio Tinto conducts its affairs in an accountable and transparent manner, reflecting the interests of Rio Tinto shareholders, employees, host communities and customers as well as others affected by the Groups activities.
Policies on transparency, business integrity, corporate governance and internal controls and reporting procedures are outlined in The way we work.
In 2003, a Compliance guidance was issued to provide a framework to enable each Group business to implement and maintain a best practice compliance programme which should identify and manage risks associated with non compliance with laws, regulations, codes, standards and Rio Tinto policies.
Assurance and verification To be accountable and transparent, assurance is provided to the Group and others that Rio Tinto policies are being implemented fully and consistently across our businesses and operations.
The overall objective of external assurance and data verification is to provide assurance that the material in the Social and environment review is relevant, complete and accurate and, in particular, that Rio Tintos policies and programmes are reflected in implementation activities at operations.
In 2003, Environmental Resources Management ERM undertook the external assurance and data verification programme and the results are available in the Social and environment review.
