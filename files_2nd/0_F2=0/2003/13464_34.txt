These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to net earnings and shareholders funds that would be required under Australian GAAP is set out above.
Goodwill For 1997 and prior years, UK GAAP permitted the write off of purchased goodwill on acquisitions directly against reserves.
Under Australian GAAP, goodwill is capitalised and amortised by charges against income over the period during which it is expected to be of benefit, subject to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves in the UK GAAP accounts has been reinstated and amortised for the purpose of the reconciliation statements.
For acquisitions in 1998 and subsequent years, goodwill is capitalised under UK GAAP, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10.
Adjustments are required for Australian GAAP purposes where such capitalised goodwill is amortised over periods exceeding 20 years in the UK GAAP accounts.
Taxation Under UK GAAP, provision for the taxes arising on remittances of earnings can only be made if the dividends have been accrued or if there is a binding agreement for the distribution of the earnings.
Under Australian GAAP, provision must be made for tax arising on expected future remittances of past earnings.
Under UK GAAP, tax benefits associated with goodwill charged directly to reserves, in 1997 and previous years, must be accumulated in the deferred tax provision.
This means that the tax benefits are not included in earnings until the related goodwill is charged through the profit and loss account on disposal or closure.
For Australian GAAP, no provision is required for such deferred tax because the goodwill that gave rise to these tax benefits was capitalised and gives rise to amortisation charges against profit.
Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, ordinary dividends are recognised in the financial year in respect of which they are paid.
Under Australian GAAP, with effect from 1 January 2003, such dividends are not recognised until they are declared, determined or publicly recommended by the board of directors.
Prior to 1 January 2003, Australian GAAP was consistent with UK GAAP.

Merger terms On 21 December 1995, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, which are listed respectively on Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom and Australia, entered into a dual listed companies DLC merger.
This was effected by contractual arrangements between the companies and amendments to Rio Tinto plcs Memorandum and Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limiteds constitution.
As a result, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective groups operate together as a single economic enterprise, with neither assuming a dominant role.
In particular, the arrangements: confer upon the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited a common economic interest in both groups: provide for common boards of directors and a unified management structure: provide for equalised dividends and capital distributions: and provide for the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to take key decisions, including the election of directors, through an electoral procedure in which the public shareholders of the two companies effectively vote on a joint basis.
The merger involved no change in the legal ownership of any assets of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor any change in the ownership of any existing shares or securities of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor the issue of any shares, securities or payment by way of consideration, save for the issue by each company of one special voting share to a trustee company which provides the joint electoral procedure for public shareholders.
During 2002, each of the parent companies issued a DLC Dividend Share to facilitate the efficient management of funds within the DLC structure.
Accounting standards The financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards.
The merger of economic interests is accounted for as a merger under FRS 6.
Australian Corporations Act The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC on 21 July 2003.
The main provisions of the order are that the financial statements are: to be made out in accordance with United Kingdom requirements applicable to consolidated accounts: to be expressed in United States dollars, but may also be expressed in United Kingdom and Australian currencies: and to include a reconciliation from UK GAAP to Australian GAAP see page 85.
For further details of the ASIC Class Order relief see page 134.
United Kingdom Companies Act In order to present a true and fair view of the Rio Tinto Group, in accordance with FRS 6, the principles of merger accounting have been adopted.
This represents a departure from the provision of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 which sets out the conditions for merger accounting based on the assumption that a merger is effected through the issue of equity shares.
The main consequence of adopting merger rather than acquisition accounting is that the balance sheet of the merged group includes the assets and liabilities of Rio Tinto Limited at their carrying values prior to the merger, subject to adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, rather than at their fair values at the date of the merger.
In the particular circumstances of the merger, the effect of applying acquisition accounting cannot reasonably be quantified.
In order that the financial statements should present a true and fair view, it is necessary to differ from the presentational requirements of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 by including amounts attributable to both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited public shareholders in the capital and reserves shown in the balance sheet and in the profit for the financial year.
The Companies Act 1985 would require presentation of the capital and reserves and profit for the year attributable to Rio Tinto Limited public shareholders set out in note 25 as a minority interest in the financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group.
This presentation would not give a true and fair view of the effect of the Sharing Agreement under which the position of all public shareholders is as nearly as possible the same as if they held shares in a single company.
Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements 87 OUTLINE OF DUAL LISTED COMPANIES STRUCTURE 736505 2070 a 2 21 04 5:04 PM Page 88 Notes to the 2003 financial statements 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation The Groups accounting policies comply with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and are consistent with last year.
As explained in the section headed Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements, the accounting policies depart from the requirements of the Companies Act in order to provide a true and fair view of the merger between Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.
b Basis of consolidation The financial statements consist of the consolidation of the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis.
The Groups shares of the assets, liabilities, earnings and reserves of associated undertakings associates and joint ventures are included in the Group financial statements using the equity and gross equity accounting methods respectively.
The Group consolidates its own share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of joint arrangements that are not entities.
c Turnover Turnover comprises sales to third parties at invoiced amounts, with most sales being priced ex works, free on board f. o. b. or cost, insurance and freight c. i. f.. A large proportion of Group production is sold under medium to long term contracts and is included in sales when deliveries are made.
Gross turnover shown in the profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the turnover of joint ventures and associates.
By-product revenues are included in turnover.
d Shipping and handling costs All shipping and handling costs incurred by the Group are recognised as operating costs.
Amounts billed to customers in respect of shipping and handling, where the Group is responsible for the carriage, insurance and freight, are classified as revenue.
If, however, the Group is acting solely as an agent, amounts billed to customers are credited to operating costs.
e Currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction or, where foreign currency forward contracts have been arranged, at contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at year-end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
On consolidation, profit and loss account items are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates.
Certain non United States resident companies, whose functional currency is the US dollar, account in that currency.
The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars and a significant proportion of the Groups US dollar debt is located in subsidiaries having functional currencies other than the US dollar.
Exchange gains and losses relating to US dollar debt impact on the profit and loss accounts of such subsidiaries.
However, such exchange gains and losses are excluded from the Groups profit and loss account on consolidation, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
This means that financing in US dollars impacts in a consistent manner on the Groups consolidated accounts irrespective of the functional currency of the particular subsidiary where the debt is located.
Exchange differences on the translation of the net operating assets of companies with functional currencies other than the US dollar, less offsetting exchange differences on net debt in currencies other than the US dollar financing those net assets, are dealt with through reserves.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise, except as set out below in note p relating to derivative contracts.
f Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisitions after 31 December 1997 are capitalised in accordance with FRS 10.
These assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, which may exceed 20 years.
Amortisation is charged on a straight line or units of production basis as appropriate.
In 1997 and previous years, goodwill was eliminated against reserves in the year of acquisition as a matter of accounting policy.
Such goodwill was not reinstated on implementation of FRS 10: but on sale or closure of a business, any related goodwill eliminated against reserves is charged to the profit and loss account.
g Exploration and evaluation During the initial stage of a project, full provision is made for the costs thereof by charge against profits for the year.
Expenditure on a project after it has reached a stage at which there is a high degree of confidence in its viability is carried forward and transferred to tangible fixed assets if the project proceeds.
If a project does not prove viable, all irrecoverable costs associated with the project are written off.
If an undeveloped project is sold, any gain or loss is included in operating profit, such transactions being a normal part of the Groups activities.
Where expenditure is carried forward in respect of a project which may not proceed to commercial development for some time, provision is made against the possibility of non development by charge against profits over a period of up to seven years.
When it is decided to proceed with development, any provisions made in previous years are reversed to the extent that the relevant costs are recoverable.
h Tangible fixed assets The cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Costs associated with a start up period are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Net interest before tax payable on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for use are complete.
i Mining properties and leases Once a mining project has been established as commercially viable, expenditure other than that on buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised under mining properties and leases together with any amount transferred from exploration and evaluation.
Such expenditure is amortised against profits, applying the same principles as for other tangible fixed assets.
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits.
The costs of removing waste materials are referred to as stripping costs.
During the development of a mine, before production commences, such costs are capitalised as part of the investment in construction of the mine.
88 Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements NOTES TO THE 2003 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 736505 2070 a 2 21 04 5:05 PM Page 89 i Mining properties and leases continued Removal of waste materials continues during the production stage of the mine.
The Group defers such production stage stripping costs where this is the most appropriate basis for matching revenue and costs and the effect is material.
The deferral of, and subsequent charges for, these stripping costs are based on the life of mine stripping ratio.
This ratio is calculated by dividing the estimated total volume of production stage stripping by the estimated future ore production over the life of the operation.
The ratio is then applied to the quantity of ore mined in the period to determine the current period production cost charged against earnings.
j Depreciation and carrying values of fixed assets Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate.
Assets are fully depreciated over their economic lives, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter.
Depreciation rates for the principal assets of the Group vary from two and a half per cent to ten per cent per annum.
Tangible and intangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In addition, goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first complete financial year after the relevant acquisition and, where the goodwill is being amortised over a period exceeding 20 years, annually thereafter.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit, or disposal value if higher.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit.
Estimates of future net cash flows are based on ore reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction.
k Determination of ore reserves Rio Tinto estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of September 1999 the JORC code.
Reserves and, for certain mines, resources determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation, impairment and close down and restoration costs.
l Provisions for close down and restoration and for environmental clean up costs Both for close down and restoration and for environmental clean up costs, provision is made in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
The amortisation or unwinding of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of provisions is charged to the profit and loss account in each accounting period.
The amortisation of the discount is shown as a financing cost rather than as an operating cost.
For close down and restoration costs, which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas, movements in provisions other than the amortisation of the discount, such as those resulting from changes in the cost estimates, in the lives of operations or in discount rates, are capitalised and depreciated over future production.
m Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost for raw materials and stores is purchase price and for partly processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads.
Inventories are valued on a first in, first out FIFO basis.
n Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but have not reversed at the balance sheet date, except in limited circumstances.
The main exceptions are as follows: Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is provided only to the extent that dividends have been accrued or there is a binding agreement to distribute such past earnings.
Deferred tax is not recognised on revaluations of non monetary assets arising on acquisitions unless there is a binding agreement to sell the asset and the gain or loss expected to arise from the disposal has been recognised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Provisions for deferred tax are made in respect of tax benefits related to goodwill that was charged directly to reserves on acquisitions made prior to 1998.
Such provisions are released when the related goodwill is charged through the profit and loss account on disposal or closure.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted to their present value.
o Post retirement benefits In accordance with SSAP 24, the expected costs of post retirement benefits under defined benefit arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs over the service lives of employees entitled to those benefits.
Variations from the regular cost are spread on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees.
Costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
p Financial instruments The Groups policy with regard to Treasury management and financial instruments is set out in the Financial review.
When the Group enters into derivative contracts these transactions are designed to reduce exposures related to assets and liabilities, firm commitments or anticipated transactions, and are therefore accounted for as hedges.
Amounts receivable and payable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as an adjustment to net interest over the life of the contract.
Gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts and currency swaps relating to financial assets and liabilities are matched against the losses or gains on the hedged items, either in the profit and loss account or through reserves as appropriate.
Gains and losses on financial instruments relating to firm commitments or anticipated transactions for revenue items are deferred and recognised when the hedged transaction occurs.
Gains and losses on financial instruments relating to firm commitments or anticipated transactions for capital expenditure are capitalised and depreciated in line with the underlying asset.
The cash flows from these contracts are classified in a manner consistent with the underlying nature of the related transaction.

In 2003 the exceptional gains total US$126 million, of which US$19 million related to subsidiaries and associates and US$107 million to joint ventures.
These gains arose on sales of operations.
These transactions did not give rise to a tax charge.
The exceptional charges of US$879 million recognised in 2002 comprised provisions of US$763 million for the impairment of asset carrying values and a charge of US$116 million related to environmental remediation works at Kennecott Utah Copper KUC.
Of the impairment charge, US$480 million related to KUC and US$235 million related to the Iron Ore Company of Canada IOC.
Of the total charge, US$16 million before tax related to joint ventures and the remainder to subsidiaries.
Most of the 2002 impairment provisions were calculated so as to ensure that the carrying value of the relevant assets were the same as the present value of the expected future cash flows relating to those assets.
The discount rates used in calculating the present value of expected future cash flows were derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, with appropriate risk adjustments.
When adjusted to include inflation and grossed up at the Groups average tax rate for 2002, before exceptional items, the discount rate applied to the relevant income generating units was equivalent to ten per cent, except for gold production for which a rate equivalent to seven per cent was used.

The provision is expected to be utilised over the next 15 to 20 years.
b The provision for other employee entitlements includes pension entitlements of US$77 million and a provision for long service leave, based on the relevant entitlements in certain Group operations.
Some US$116 million is expected to be utilised within the next year.
c The Groups policy on close down and restoration costs is shown in note 1 l. Close down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of close down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the mine.
Remaining lives of mines and smelters range from two to over 50 years with an average, weighted by closure provision, of around 20 years.
Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, subsidiary companies have estimated their respective costs based on feasibility and engineering studies using current restoration standards and techniques.
Provisions of US$2,092 million for close down and restoration costs and other environmental obligations include estimates of the effect of future inflation and have been discounted to their present value at six per cent per annum, being an estimate of the risk free pre-tax cost of borrowing.
Excluding the effects of future inflation, but before discounting, this is equivalent to some US$3.0 billion.
d Some US$126 million of environmental clean up expenditure is expected to take place within the next five years.
The remainder includes amounts for the operation and maintenance of remediation facilities in later years.
The provision for environmental expenditure includes the issue described in e below.
e In 1995, Kennecott Utah Copper KUC agreed with the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the State of Utah to complete certain source control projects and perform specific environmental studies regarding contamination of ground water in the vicinity of the Bingham Canyon mine.
A remedial investigation and feasibility study on the South Zone ground water contamination, completed in March 1998, identified a range of alternative measures to address this issue.
Additional studies were conducted to refine the workable alternatives.
A remedial design document was completed in 2002.
A joint proposal and related agreements were updated and provided to the Trustee in the third quarter of 2003.
Some modifications of the original plan may be necessary in response to comments from the public.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
In other cases, fair values have been calculated using quotations from independent financial institutions, or by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing market rates.
The fair value of cash, short term borrowings and loans to joint ventures and associates approximates to the carrying value, as a result of their short maturity, or because they carry floating rates of interest.
If Rio Tintos financial instruments were realised at the fair values shown, tax of US$86 million would become payable 2002: US$37 million recoverable.
The maturity of the financial instruments is shown in the notes above.

In 2002, the Australian Tax Office ATO issued assessments of approximately A$500 million which amount includes penalties and interest in relation to certain transactions undertaken in 1997 to acquire franking credits.
The transactions were conducted based on the Groups considered view of the law prevailing at the time.
Subsequently, the law was changed.
The Group lodged objections to the assessments and on 26 May 2003 the ATO substantially disallowed those objections.
The Group subsequently lodged proceedings in the Federal Court to dispute the assessments.
As required by Australian tax law and practice, part payment of the disputed tax assessments was required pending resolution of the dispute.
A payment of A$164 million was made, which will be subject to recovery with interest if, as it is believed based on Counsels opinion, the Group is successful in challenging the assessments.
Consequently, the amount paid has been recorded as a receivable on the balance sheet see note 16.
As at the year end, the amount of the disputed tax assessments, penalties and interest stood at approximately A$454 million US$340 million at the year end exchange rate after tax relief on the general interest charge component.
There are a number of legal claims arising from the normal course of business which are currently outstanding against the Group.
No material loss to the Group is expected to result from these claims.
Employee numbers for joint arrangements, joint ventures and associates are proportional to the Groups equity interest.
b Part time employees are included on a full time equivalent basis.
Temporary employees are included in employee numbers.
c People employed by contractors are not included.

Leighton Holdings Limited Leighton : In 2001, John Morschel became a director and, subsequently, the chairman of Leighton, Australias largest project development and contracting group.
A number of Rio Tinto companies in Australia and Indonesia have, in the ordinary course of their businesses, awarded commercial contracts to subsidiaries of Leighton.
The board does not consider the value of these contracts to be material to the business of either Leighton or the Rio Tinto Group.
On 22 December 2003, Leighton announced that Mr Morschel would be resigning from the board of Leighton.
Mr Morschel is expected to resign by the end of March 2004.

Access to the mine site has not been possible and an accurate assessment of the condition of the assets cannot be determined.
Considerable funding would be required to recommence operations to the level which applied at the time of the mines closure in 1989 and these funding requirements cannot be forecast accurately.
The directors do not have access to reliable, verifiable or objective information on BCL and the directors have therefore decided to exclude BCL information from the financial statements.
BCL reported a net profit of US$4 million for the financial year 2002: profit of US$2 million.
This is based upon actual transactions for the financial year.
The aggregate amount of capital and reserves reported by BCL as at 31 December 2003 was US$97 million 2002: US$76 million.
The Group owns 214,887,966 shares in BCL, representing 53.6 per cent of the issued share capital.
The investment of US$195 million was fully provided against in 1991.
At 31 December 2003, the market value of the shareholding in BCL was US$39 million.
41 POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS a SSAP 24 accounting and disclosure Pensions The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world.
Whilst some of these plans are defined contribution, the majority are of the funded defined benefit type, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Valuations of these plans are produced and updated annually to 31 December by independent qualified actuaries.
Further details regarding the plans are provided in the FRS 17 disclosures in section b of this note.

Other information A triennial actuarial valuation of the Groups UK plan was made at 31 March 2003 using the projected unit method.
In Australia, whilst Group companies sponsor or subscribe to a number of pension plans, the Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund is the only significant plan.
This plan principally contains defined contribution liabilities but also has defined benefit liabilities.
Valuations are made at least every three years using the projected unit method, with the latest valuation being as at 30 June 2003.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US entities, typically with separate provision for salaried and hourly paid staff.
Valuations are made annually at 1 January using the projected unit method.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by entities in Canada.
Valuations are updated annually using the projected unit method.
Other defined benefit plans sponsored by the Group around the world were assessed at various dates during 2001, 2002 and 2003.
The above summary is based on the most recent valuation in each case, updated to the appropriate balance sheet date.
The expected average remaining service life in the major plans ranges from ten to 17 years with an overall average of 12 years.
The Group uses asset values based on market value, but smoothed over a one year period in arriving at its pension costs under SSAP 24.
The main pension plans providing purely defined contribution benefits held assets, equal to their liabilities, of US$186 million as at 31 December 2003.
The Groups contributions to these plans of US$9 million are charged against profits and are included in the Regular cost shown below.
The Group also operates a number of unfunded plans, which are included within the deficit and percentage coverage statistics above, measured on a basis consistent with both SSAP 24 and FRS 17.

The increase in the variation cost in 2003 reflects the reduced surpluses increased deficits of the plans at 1 January 2003 compared to 1 January 2002.

Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria.
On 30 September 2003, the unfunded accumulated post retirement benefit obligation and annual cost of accrual of benefits were determined by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The main financial assumptions were: discount rate 6.1 per cent at 30 September 2002: 6.5 per cent, Medical Trend Rate 11.2 per cent reducing to 4.7 per cent by the year 2011 at 30 September 2002: initially 8.0 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2009, claims cost based on individual company experience.
The assumptions were consistent with those adopted for determining pension costs.
At 30 September 2003, which is the measurement date, the unfunded accumulated post retirement benefits obligation excluding associates and joint ventures was US$563 million at 30 September 2002: US$437 million.

The standard requires pension deficits, and surpluses to the extent that they are considered recoverable, to be recognised in full.
Annual service cost and net financial income on the assets and liabilities of the plans are recognised through earnings.
Other fluctuations in the value of the surpluses deficits are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL.
Details of post retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities at 31 December 2003, 2002 and 2001, valued on a projected unit basis in accordance with FRS 17, are set out below: UK Australia US Canada Other mainly Africa Main assumptions for FRS 17 purposes At 31 December 2003 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 6.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.8% 2.5% 4.5% Discount rate 5.4% 6.0% 5.9% 6.1% 9.0% Inflation 2.8% 2.5% 2.5% 2.3% 4.5% At 31 December 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 4.0% 3.2% 3.7% 10.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.3% 2.5% 7.0% Discount rate 5.6% 6.2% 6.2% 6.5% 11.5% Inflation 2.3% 2.5% 2.2% 2.2% 7.0% At 31 December 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 5.5% 4.0% 3.5% 4.0% 10.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.5% 2.5% 5.8% Discount rate 6.0% 6.5% 7.0% 7.0% 11.5% Inflation 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 5.8% The main financial assumptions used for the health care schemes, which are predominantly in the US, were: discount rate: 5.9 per cent 2002: 6.2 per cent, 2001: 7.0 per cent, Medical Trend Rate: 11.5 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2011 2002: Medical Trend Rate: 8.0 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2009, 2001: Medical Trend Rate: 8.5 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2009, claims cost based on individual company experience.
In addition, there were contributions of US$18 million 2002: US$16 million in respect of unfunded health care schemes in the year.
Since these schemes are unfunded, contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments and therefore cannot be predetermined.
In relation to pensions, it is currently expected that there will be no regular employer or employee contributions to the UK plan in 2004.
Contributions are made to the main Australian plan according to the recommendation of the plan actuary and are primarily to a mixed defined benefit defined contribution type arrangement included in the above figures.
In North America, contributions are agreed annually in nominal terms.
Additional contributions will be paid in 2004 in the light of the position in the US and Canadian plans.
Whilst contributions for 2004 are yet to be determined, the currently expected level of contributions by the Group to the plans in Australia, Canada and the US is expected to be some US$30-US$40 million higher than in 2003.
The most recent full valuation of the UK plans was at 31 March 2003.
The most recent full valuation of the Australian plans was at 30 June 2003.
For both the US and Canadian major plans, the most recent full valuation was at 1 January 2003.

The order applies to Rio Tinto Limiteds financial reporting obligations for financial years and half-years ending between 30 June 2003 and 31 December 2004 inclusive.

In addition, those combined financial statements are to be prepared: on the basis of merger, rather than acquisition, accounting under UK GAAP ie on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited was not acquired by, and is not controlled by, Rio Tinto plc and that carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and liabilities at the time of formation of the Groups dual listed companies structure were used to measure those assets and liabilities at formation : in accordance with the principles and requirements of UK GAAP, rather than Australian GAAP except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report, and in accordance with United Kingdom financial reporting obligations generally: with United States dollars as the reporting currency although translations to Australian dollars and United Kingdom pounds may be included, and translations to Australian dollars are required for a summary statement of financial position for the Group : and with a reconciliation of information from UK GAAP to Australian GAAP see page 85.
The combined financial statements must also be audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom requirements.

Rio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act including timing requirements in relation to the combined financial statements including any concise report, the Auditors report and the Directors report.
Rio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare consolidated financial statements for it and its controlled entities.
Rio Tinto Limited is required to prepare and lodge parent entity financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year, in accordance with the principles and requirements of Australian GAAP and with Australian dollars as the reporting currency, and to have those statements audited.
The statements are not required to be laid before the Companys annual general meeting or distributed to shareholders as a matter of course.
However, Rio Tinto Limited must: include in the combined financial statements for the Group, as a note, summary parent entity financial statements for Rio Tinto Limited ie summary statements of financial position, financial performance and cash flows, prepared in accordance with Australian GAAP and with Australian dollars as the reporting currency: and make available the full parent entity financial statement free of charge to shareholders on request, and also include a copy of them on the Companys website.
The parent entity financial statements are available for download from the Rio Tinto website at www.
Shareholders may also request a copy free of charge by contacting the Rio Tinto Limited company secretary.
Directors Declaration The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards and other relevant financial reporting requirements and in accordance with applicable Australian law.
The financial statements and notes give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited at 31 December 2003 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended.
In the directors opinion: The financial statements and notes are in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission order dated 21 July 2003.
There are reasonable grounds to believe each of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and to pay its debts as and when they become due and and payable.
