Hong Kong SSAP34 of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the requires the defined benefit pension scheme assets to be tax basis are recognised.
The amount of deferred tax provided is measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Hong Kong based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the SSAP34 requires actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates the profit and loss account if the net cumulative unrecognised inacted or substantively inacted at the balance sheet date.

However, recognition on a fast systematic basis is permitted if consistently applied.
In addition, Hong Kong SSAP34 does not allow the balance sheet asset or liability to be offset by the related deferred tax.
The Group has not quantified, on practical grounds, the differences arising from the different treatments between Hong Kong GAAP and UK GAAP for retirement benefits.
In order to quantify the differences, the Group would need to examine approximately 50 different retirement benefit schemes operating throughout the world during the period.
Additionally, the Group has already provided disclosures under two accounting standards UK SSAP24 and FRS17.
Full compliance with a third standard Hong Kong SSAP34 would be costly in terms of commissioning a third actuarial review, the results of which the Group do not believe would be materially different from those obtained under the FRS17 disclosures.
