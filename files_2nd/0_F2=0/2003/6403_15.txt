As a result the deferred consideration payable of EUR.
18,294,000 has been released in full.
For CentroMAIL this performance period runs to the 31 January 2004.
The maximum potential deferred consideration payable is 3,500,000.

As a result the deferred consideration provision has also been released in full.
b Current year acquisitions During the year the Group acquired the trade and assets of four further CentroMAIL franchises in Spain.
