The Group has hedged all material foreign currency exposures by using off balance sheet hedging instruments so that there are no material unmatched exposures at the balance sheet date.

Therefore, the Group is not subject to any structural currency exposures.
38 Pensions Pension costs relating to dened benefit and dened contribution sections of the Scheme can be analysed as follows: 2003 2002 a SSAP 24 Disclosures Group m m Regular cost 17.8 17.1 Variations from regular cost i 6.6 4.9 Notional interest on prepayment 1.4 1.5 Total 23.0 20.5 i Variations from regular cost arise from the scheme deficit being spread on a basis changing in line with pensionable payroll over the average expected future working life of the membership 15 years.
The Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme the Scheme comprises funded dened benefit sections which became closed to new entrants on 31 March 1998.
New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a dened contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is an exempt approved pension scheme under which retirement and death benets are provided for Group employees.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the nances of the participating employers.
In addition benets are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989 whose benets would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation was made as at 31 March 2002.
The significant assumptions in these valuations were that salaries increase on average by 2.0% p. a. above ination, long term return on investments is 7.0% p. a. in the period before members reach retirement and 5.5% p. a. in the post-retirement period, and that pensions increase at 2.5% p. a.
Assets were valued at their market value as at 31 March 2002.
At 31 March 2002 the market value of the assets of the dened benefit section of the Scheme was 727.7m and this was sufficient to cover 92% of the liabilities for benets due to members in respect of service prior to that date.
Contributions to the Scheme in 2003 amounted to 138.3m 2002: 18.1m, including a one-off contribution of 100m.
The excess of 115.1m of the dened benefit pension contribution over the charge has increased the prepayment of 19.4m at the start of the year.
An asset of 134.7m representing total net accumulated prepaid contributions is included in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2003.
Post-retirement benets The Group provides post-retirement medical benets to certain pensioners and active employees.
The liability has been assessed by an independent qualied actuary as at 31 December 2002, using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were a discount rate of 6.0% and medical benefit cost ination of 8.0% for 2 years gradually reducing to 4.35% over 5 years and remaining at 4.35% thereafter.
The charge in the year for post-retirement medical benets in the Group accounts is 1.6m 2002: 1.6m.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benets: Group accounts i Dened benefit section The following disclosures are provided under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 which requires certain disclosures only for periods ending subsequent to 22 June 2002.
The amounts disclosed under these transitional arrangements, which apply to both the funded and unfunded Schemes, are not included in the Groups financial statements.
If FRS 17 were to be fully adopted, the impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, profit and Loss Account and Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses would be as set out below.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2002 and updated by an independent qualied actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.

Annual Report & Accounts 2003 67 Notes to the Accounts continued 41 Risk management continued ii Trading book The Groups trading activities are conducted through the Groups Treasury division.
Material trading assets comprise debt securities for which the carrying value is equal to the fair value at 31 December 2003 and 2002.
Dealing profits are disclosed in note 2.
The bank uses a variety of techniques to measure market risk in the trading book, including calculating the sensitivity of the market value of positions to hypothetical changes in interest rates.
The following table sets out the change in the value of the trading book arising from a 1% change in market interest rates, for the year ended 31 December 2003, with all other variables remaining constant: Change in value m m 2003 2002 Highest exposure 0.9 0.9 Lowest exposure 0.3 0.3 Average exposure 0.6 0.5 Exposure as at 31 December 0.5 0.5 The sensitivity analysis technique used by the Group measures the change in the fair value of the Groups trading book arising from hypothetical changes in market rates.
Actual results in the future could differ from these projected figures if fluctuations in interest rates exceeded the hypothetical 1% shift.
The Groups trading book is not materially exposed to other market risks.
iii Fair values The table below compares the book and fair values of some of the Groups financial instruments by category at the balance sheet date.
Where available, market prices have been used to determine fair values.
Where market prices are not available, fair values have been calculated for options by using option-pricing models and for other financial instruments by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Minor changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated fair values, and, as a result, readers of these financial statements are advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
The concept of fair value assumes realisation of financial instruments by way of sale.
However, in many cases, the Group intends to realise assets through collection over time.

These gures represent accrued interest at the year-end.

Contract amount indicates the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and does not represent amounts at risk.
The replacement cost represents the cost of replacing contracts, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date and reects the Groups exposure should counterparties default.
No account is taken of offsetting positions with the same counterparty.

Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows: Group 2003 Group 2002 Total net Total net Gains Losses gains losses Gains Losses gains losses m m m m m m Unrecognised gains losses on hedges at 1 January 2003 262.5 239.2 23.3 249.1 134.6 114.5 Gains losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 32.3 44.9 12.6 74.9 45.9 29.0 Gains losses arising before 1 January 2003 that were not recognised in the year 230.2 194.3 35.9 174.2 88.7 85.5 Gains losses arising in the year that were not recognised in the year 35.7 397.0 432.7 88.3 150.5 62.2 Unrecognised gains losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 194.5 591.3 396.8 262.5 239.2 23.3 Of which: Gains losses expected to be recognised in the next year 22.5 178.9 156.4 32.3 44.9 12.6 Gains losses expected to be recognised after the next financial year 172.0 412.4 240.4 230.2 194.3 35.9 The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group.
The gains and losses do not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments.

Excess capital is held within Treasury & Group.
b Costs have been assigned to each sector based on resources consumed.
Corporate overheads not directly attributable to business units, including strategy costs of 18.0m 2002: 50.6m are included within Treasury & Group.
c The Group operates entirely within the banking and insurance business, and operations are not managed on the basis of an allocation of net assets.
The level of banking assets can uctuate throughout the year, therefore the information derived from the year end gures does not provide a picture representative of the year as a whole.
A more meaningful analysis of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities by business sector is contained within the Business and Financial Reviews on pages 8 to 20. d No geographical analysis is presented because substantially all of the Groups activities are in the UK.
