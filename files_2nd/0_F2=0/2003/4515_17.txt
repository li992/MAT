HM Customs & Excise contended that this income should be liable to VAT at the standard rate and in July 2000 raised a VAT assessment.
Following a VAT tribunal hearing in December 2002, an adverse judgement was received in April 2003.
The Board has subsequently agreed to settle the liability which equates to VAT and costs of 7,268,000 and interest of 2,255,000.
In addition a deferred tax credit of 1,998,000 has been recognised in respect of this item resulting in a net charge to the profit and loss account of 7,525,000.
This issue was previously disclosed as a contingent liability in the notes to the Group accounts for the year ending 29 September 2002.
The operating exceptional item in 2002 of 300,000 is the compensation in respect of committed income not received due to the postponement of the Ryder Cup until September 2002 following the events of 11 September 2001.
Of the current year operating exceptional items nil was paid in the year 2002: 300,000 was received in the year.

The deferred tax provision has not been discounted.
iii Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group does not expect to pay any UK Corporation tax for the next two years as a result of the availability of tax losses carried forward and accelerated capital allowances on its ongoing capital expenditure programme.
As a result of deferred and overseas tax, the Group expects its tax charge for the foreseeable future to remain at an effective rate close to the UK Corporation tax rate of 30%.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised where the likelihood of realisation fails to meet the more likely than not criterion.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
At the year-end, the total unprovided deferred tax on assets if sold at book value would be 58 million 2002: 75 million and gains rolled over into replacement assets nil 2002: nil.
Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief and if expenditure on replacement assets was less than anticipated.
However, it is not expected that any capital gain will be crystallised in the foreseeable future.

Pensions a Pensions The Group operates a contracted-out defined benefit scheme, The Greenalls Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Scheme is now closed to new members.
Contributions are paid into the Scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The latest formal triennial actuarial valuation was carried out on 5 April 2003 and a formal report from the actuary will be submitted to the pension scheme trustees in December 2003.
The previous valuation was carried out on 5 April 2000 and this disclosed that the value of the Schemes assets totalled 203 million at market value, which represented 79% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The liabilities were valued on a market-related projected unit basis.
Under this basis the current service cost will increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
Following the disposal of the Pubs & Restaurants business, in December 1999, and based on subsequent advice from the Groups actuaries, the Group undertook to improve the funding level of the Scheme by contributing an additional 40 million to the Scheme payable over a four year period.
As the additional contribution requirement arose from the significant reduction in Scheme membership a liability was recorded immediately.
At the year-end 37.5 million had been contributed, with the final payment of 2.5 million being due on 1 November 2003.
The Group also operates a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan for employees in which liabilities are restricted to the level of contributions paid into the Scheme.
The assumptions, which have had the most significant effect on the funding of the Scheme, are set out in the following table: % Price inflation 3.00 Pension increases non-guaranteed minimum pension 3.00 Return on investments net of investment costs and expenses 5.75 Increase in pensionable earnings 4.75 46 fide VERE GROUP PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 17.
