36 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and, except for the treatment of certain grants and contributions, comply with the requirements of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 the Act.
An explanation of this departure from the requirements of the Act is given in the policy on grants and contributions below.
There have been no new accounting standards adopted in the year.
The group continues to adopt the transitional provisions of FRS 17, requiring certain additional disclosures which are set out in note 23. b Basis of consolidation The financial statements include the results of Severn Trent Plc and its subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of joint venture undertakings are accounted for on a gross equity basis where the companys holding is 50% and the company exercises joint control under a contractual arrangement.
The results of associates are accounted for on an equity basis where the companys holding is 20% or more and the company exercises significant inuence.
c Turnover Turnover represents the income receivable excluding value added tax in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided and, in respect of contract work in progress, the value of work carried out.
Income includes an estimation of the amount of main water and wastewater charges unbilled at the year-end.
The accrual is estimated using a dened methodology based upon a measure of unbilled water consumed by tariff, which is calculated from historical billing information.
d Tangible xed assets and depreciation Tangible xed assets comprise: i Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams and sludge pipelines.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancements of the network and on maintaining the operating capability of the network in accordance with the dened standards of service is treated as an addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charged for infrastructure assets is the estimated, anticipated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network less the estimated, anticipated level of relevant annual grants and contributions, based on the companys independently certied asset management plan.
ii Landll sites Landll sites are included within Land and Buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of landll sites includes the cost of acquiring, developing and engineering sites, but does not include interest.
The cost of the asset is depreciated over the estimated life of the site on the basis of the usage of void space.
iii Other assets Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Years Buildings 30-60 Operational structures 40-80 Fixed plant 20-40 Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 2-15 Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
37 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 e Leased assets Where assets are nanced by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the assets are accounted for as if they had been purchased and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and a finance charge, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor and the finance charge being written off to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease period.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed in the year in which they are incurred.
f Grants and contributions Grants and contributions received in respect of non infrastructure assets are treated as deferred income and are recognised in the profit and loss account over the useful economic life of those assets.
In accordance with industry practice, grants and contributions relating to infrastructure assets have been deducted from the cost of xed assets.
This is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Act, which requires assets to be shown at their purchase price or production cost and hence grants and contributions to be presented as deferred income.
This departure from the requirements of the Act is, in the opinion of the Directors, necessary to give a true and fair view as, while a provision is made for depreciation of infrastructure assets, these assets do not have determinable finite lives and therefore no basis exists on which to recognise grants and contributions as deferred income.
The effect of this departure is that the cost of xed assets is 327.0 million lower than it would otherwise have been 2002: 294.5 million.
Those grants and contributions relating to the maintenance of the operating capability of the infrastructure network are taken into account in determining the depreciation charged for infrastructure assets.
g Investments Investments held as xed assets are stated at cost less amounts written off.
h Stocks Stocks are stated at cost less provisions necessary to account for any damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and an element of overheads.
Development land and properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites.
The net realisable value of development land is based upon its value as a serviced site, after taking account of the cost of providing infrastructure services.
Turnover and attributable profits on properties under development are determined by reference to valuation of work carried out to date.
i Landll restoration costs Provision for the cost of restoring landll sites is made over the operational life of each landll site and charged to the profit and loss account on the basis of the usage of void space.
j Environmental control and aftercare costs Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred over the operational life of each landll site and may be incurred for a considerable period thereafter.
Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the profit and loss account on the basis of the usage of void space.
k Insurance Provision is made for claims notied and for claims incurred but which have not yet been notied, based on advice from the groups external insurance advisers.
l Pension costs Costs of dened benefit pension schemes are determined by an independent actuary so as to spread the cost of providing pension benets over the estimated period of employees average service lives with the group.
Costs of dened contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they fall due.
38 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued m Foreign currency The trading results of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
The net equity interests in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
Exchange differences thus arising are treated as movements in reserves together with exchange differences on loans between group companies.
Exchange differences arising in respect of foreign exchange instruments taken out as hedges of overseas investments are also treated as movements in reserves.
All other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the company and its United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
In those instances where forward cover has been arranged, the forward rate is used.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
All profits and losses on exchange arising during the year are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
n Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on tangible xed assets relating to research and development projects is written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
o Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is fully provided in respect of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes only to the extent that an entity has an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Material deferred taxation balances arising are discounted by applying an appropriate risk free discount rate.
For the purposes of discounting, the period over which accelerated capital allowances in respect of infrastructure assets reverse, is determined by the estimated annual cost of maintaining the operating capability of the network.
p Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 remains eliminated against reserves.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is treated as an intangible xed asset in the balance sheet and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Capitalised goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
Useful economic lives are currently estimated at between 5 and 20 years.
q Euro costs Costs of preparing systems and other applications for the introduction of the Euro are written off to the profit and loss account as incurred, unless there is a significant enhancement to the system or application, in which case, the costs are capitalised and depreciated in line with the policy stated in d. r Derivatives and other financial instruments Debt instruments The financial costs of debt instruments are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Such costs include the cost of issue and any discount to face value arising on issue, or any premium arising on maturity.
Differences arising from the movement in exchange rates during the year on translation into sterling of the foreign currency borrowings and similar instruments used to finance long-term equity investments, are taken directly to reserves and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Derivative financial instruments Financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and to a lesser extent currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the group and the nancing of those activities.
There is no trading activity in financial instruments.
A review of how the financial risks are managed is included in the Financial review.
Financial instruments are accounted for as follows: Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity: Currency swaps are used to hedge foreign currency investments.
The future currency exchange within such contracts is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and any unrealised gain or loss is matched with that on the underlying asset or liability in reserves.
The interest coupon on such swaps is accrued in the same way as that on borrowings and deposits.
The aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed in note 17 to the accounts.

If amended, there would be changes in 2001 2002 to the analysis of operating costs and to the analysis of cash ows.
As such changes are not material for the group and would have no impact on the overall profit or cash ow of the group in 2001 2002, no changes have been effected.
Exceptional items in 2002 2003 included in the above analysis comprise: A charge of 46.8 million for impairment of goodwill and tangible xed assets in Services.
This was offset by a 6.0 million release of part of the 25.0 million exceptional charge made in 2001 2002 in respect of certain of Systems CIS-Open Vision contracts in the USA included within other operating costs above.
The impairment was determined in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill.
The impairment restates the relevant assets to value in use using a pre-tax discount rate of 10%.
42.5 million of this impairment charge was a write down of goodwill, the remaining 4.3 million was a write down of tangible xed assets.
The impairment has resulted in the year in a 1.2 million reduction in goodwill amortisation and a 0.6 million reduction in depreciation.
Exceptional contract costs in the year ended 31 March 2002 of 25.0 million, arising in Systems, related to the costs of completing onerous contracts in the USA.

The differences are explained below: 2003 2002 m m profit on ordinary activities before tax 184.4 216.3 profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% 55.3 64.9 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 14.4 13.6 Capital allowances for year in excess of depreciation 39.4 50.0 Utilisation of movement in short-term timing differences 0.7 8.9 Utilisation of movement in tax losses 0.3 0.1 Overseas tax rate differences 1.5 1.7 Adjustment in respect of prior years 6.0 5.1 Total current tax 24.8 16.1 c Factors affecting future tax rates The groups current tax charge of 24.8 million 2002: 16.1 million represents 11.0% 2002: 6.9% of the groups profit after interest but before exceptional items.
Due to the changing shape and maturity of the group, the current tax charge as a percentage of profit after interest but before exceptional items is expected to increase.
The groups deferred tax charge in future years is more difficult to predict as, in particular, it is impacted by changes in interest rates from one balance sheet date to the next.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on net operating losses relating to the US sub-group.
The estimated amount of the deferred tax asset not recognised measured at the UK standard rate of 30%, is 12.1 million.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Supplementary adjusted earnings per share gures are presented.
These exclude the effects of exceptional items and deferred tax in both 2003 and 2002.

An actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out at regular intervals by an independent professionally qualied actuary.
The UK dened benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: UK dened benefit scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Water Pension Scheme STWPS 31 March 2001 Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme 31 March 2001 UK Waste Pension Scheme 6 April 2001 Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2000 The STWPS is by far the largest of the groups UK dened benefit schemes Benets are also provided by the group on an unfunded, unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989, whose benets would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision is made for such benets by annual charge against the groups earnings totalling in the current year 1.2 million 2002: 1.2 million.
The group also operates dened contribution arrangements for certain of its UK and overseas employees.

Employees contributions continue at the rate of 6%, 5% or 3% of pensionable pay.
Employers contributions to STWPS in the year to 31 March 2003 amounted on average to 13.9% of pensionable payroll.
The regular cost of STWPS to the group in the year to 31 March 2003 amounted to 13.9% of pensionable payroll or 10.9% after allowing for amortisation of surplus, which has been recognised in arriving at the pension charge for the year.
