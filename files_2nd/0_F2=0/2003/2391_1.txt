INCREASING AFFLUENCE AND URBANISATION Ageing populations, declining traditional building skills, and increasing individual capital affluence, which are apparent in the more advanced and developing economies, signal a trend towards a change in market segmentation for plasterboard usage with the new commercial sector generally reducing in segmental importance to 30% or less, all-sector repair and renovation rising to 30% or more, and new residential increasing to at least 40% in more developed markets.

FOCUSING OUR STRATEGY Globally there is, therefore, considerable potential for greater demand through faster penetration in emerging regions and broader applications of easy-to-install systems in developing and more developed markets.
Our business leadership strategy remains clear: we seek to position BPB as the preferred choice for interior building systems that provide innovative design solutions.
