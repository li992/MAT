Annual Report and Accounts 2003 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of hotels and investment properties in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985 except as stated under investment properties.
Prior year adjustment The adoption of FRS 19 in 2002 was a change of accounting policy for the Group and was accounted for by way of a prior year adjustment.
The impact of adopting FRS 19 in the year ended 31 December 2002 was to increase the current year tax charge by 3.2m and to restate and decrease opening net assets at 1 January 2002 by 62.5m.
Minority interest at 1 January 2002 were also reduced by 5.8m.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of the company, its subsidiary undertakings, its associate undertakings and its joint venture undertakings made up to 31 December 2003.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
An associate is an undertaking in which the group has a long term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting rights, and over which it exercises significant influence.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The profit for the financial year dealt with in the accounts of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc, determined in accordance with the Act, was 48.7m 2002: 26.4m.
Fixed assets and depreciation Land and buildings are stated at cost or subsequent valuation less depreciation and any provision for impairment, as set out in note 11.
Other fixed assets are shown at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Any impairment of such properties below depreciated historical cost is charged to the profit and loss account as appropriate.
Assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Building core 50 years or lease term if shorter Building surface, finishes and services 30 years or lease term if shorter Plant and machinery 15-20 years Furniture and equipment 10 years Soft furnishings 5-7 years Computer equipment 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
35 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED No residual values are ascribed to building surface finishes and services.
Residual values ascribed to building core depend on the nature, location and tenure of each property.
Capital expenditure on major projects is recorded separately within fixed assets as capital work in progress.
Once the project is complete the balance is transferred to the appropriate fixed asset categories.
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Interest attributable to funds used to finance the construction or acquisition of new hotels or major extensions to existing hotels is capitalised gross of tax relief and added to the cost of the hotel core.
Operating supplies are treated as a base stock and renewals and replacements of such stocks are written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys profit and loss account.
Investment properties In accordance with SSAP19: i investment properties are revalued annually at open market values.
All surpluses and deficits arising on valuation are taken directly to revaluation reserve except that any reduction in value below historic cost is taken to the profit and loss account for the year: ii no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years to run.
This treatment, as regards certain of the Companys investment properties, may be a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Goodwill Goodwill arises as the difference between the fair value of consideration paid and the fair value of separately identifiable assets and liabilites arising on a business combination when acquisition accounting is applied.
Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Development properties Development properties under construction are included as work in progress within stocks.
Attributable profits are recognised as the development progresses.
Leases Assets financed by way of finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group, are recorded at their fair value at the inception of the lease.
The equivalent liability, categorised as appropriate, is included within creditors.
Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease to produce constant rates of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals under operating leases are charged as incurred.
Turnover Turnover represents amounts derived from: the ownership, management and operation of hotels income from property rental, development properties and land sales.
Turnover is stated net of sales taxes and is recognised following the provision of the related goods and services.
36 Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Pension costs The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of defined benefit schemes is the estimated cost of providing the benefits accrued in the year, adjusted to reflect variations from that cost in accordance with SSAP 24 : Accounting for Pension Costs.
The cost is calculated so that it represents a substantially level percentage of current and future pensionable payroll.
Variations from these costs are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the average remaining service lives of employees.
Contributions to money purchase schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Any difference between amounts charged to the profit and loss account and contributions paid to pension schemes is included in debtors or creditors in the balance sheet.
Full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board.
In the current year the Group has complied with the transitional disclosure requirements as set out in note 30.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Except as otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise when items of income and expenditure are included in tax computations in periods different from their inclusion in the financial statements.
Financial instruments In line with the Groups treasury management policies, derivative instruments are used to alter the risk profile of underlying exposures.
Gains or losses on financial instruments, such as forward contracts, options or swaps are recognised based on the duration of the underlying exposure.
The Group endeavours to finance investments in assets denominated in overseas currencies by using facilities denominated in those currencies.
Foreign exchange gains or losses on non-sterling overseas assets and related borrowings are taken to reserves.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at actual exchange rates as of the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
For the purposes of consolidation the closing rate method is used, under which translation gains or losses on opening net assets are shown as a movement on reserves.
Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate prevailing throughout the year.
Translation differences between the average and closing rates are taken to reserves.

Deferred tax balances acquired during the year relate to the acquisition of the Sunnyvale Four Points Hotel, California note 12.
The acquired deferred taxation liability arises from a fair value adjustment in relation to the acquisition of the minority interest in the Republic Hotels and Resorts Group in 2002 note 12.
20 DEFERRED TAXATION 2003 2002 m m The net deferred tax provision as at 31 December 2003 is as follows: Accelerated capital allowances 87.8 87.9 Tax losses carried forward 29.0 39.2 Other timing differences 6.6 2.3 52.2 46.4 There is no unprovided deferred taxation at either 31 December 2003 or 31 December 2002.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing properties.
If the Group were to dispose of all its properties at their book values, a tax liability estimated at 195m 2002: 196m would arise.
None of these has been provided, since the Group currently has no plans to dispose of any properties, which would lead to such liability crystallising.
A deferred tax asset totalling 15.2m 2002: 14.9m in respect of carried forward losses arising in the group has not been recognised due to it not being expected that these losses can be used to offset taxable profits in the foreseeable future.

25 CONTINGENT MATTERS a The Millennium Hilton, New York closed on 11 September 2001 and reopened on 5 May 2003.
Proceeds of US$56.5m from the insurance claim have been received in respect of the property and business interruption claims.
The business interruption claim is not settled.
In January 2003 the insurance company providing the insurance coverage above a $10.0m underlying limit took legal action to seek clarification of the period of business interruption cover.
The insurer contends that the hotel is covered for 12 months from the date of the damage and then for six months post reopening: alternatively, the insurer claims that information was withheld from it by M&Cs broker which could permit it to rescind its coverage entirely, including in relation to the capital claim.
The Group has been advised, by its broker, that the coverage applies to the period until the re-opening plus a 12 month period thereafter.
The Board has taken legal advice and based on this, and its own information, considers that its interpretation of the policy is correct and that the insurers claims are without merit.
Based on the current known facts, legal counsels view is that Board may reasonably conclude that the likelihood of the insurance company rescinding the coverage is remote.
Consequently, the directors consider it unlikely that the Group will be required to repay any amounts already received from the insurer and they do not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have any material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
The Board will vigorously defend the action and assert the Groups own claims against the insurers and possibly third parties, and is hopeful that this legal dispute will be resolved during 2004. b The Group and Company have contingent liabilities with regard to normal trading operations and corporate transactions.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provision has been made for all known liabilities.

30 PENSION SCHEMES, EMPLOYEES AND REMUNERATION Pension schemes United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan for its UK employees which was set up in 1993.
The scheme is a funded defined benefit arrangement with different categories of membership.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with Deutsche Asset Management Limited and Nationwide Building Society.
Scheme costs are charged so as to spread the cost of providing the guaranteed benefits over the average remaining service lives of the employees concerned.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2002 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2003.
At the April 2002 valuation date the market value of the Plans assets was 14.3m, giving a funding level of 84%.
At 31 December 2003, the market value of scheme assets was estimated at 15.7m, giving a funding level of 96%.
The contributions of the Group were 17.3% of pensionable pay until 31 March 2003, when it increased to 20.6% of pensionable pay 2002: 17.3%.
The contributions of employees were from 3% to 5% 2002: 3.5% to 5% of pensionable earnings.
As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed in April 2002 that investment returns would be between 5% and 7% per annum, that salary increases would average 5% per annum and that pensions would increase at rates varying between 2.7% and 3.5%.
The expected average working lifetime of the members was calculated to be 8 years.
The next valuation of the Scheme is due as at 6 April 2005.
The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme for its UK employees.
United States The Group operates defined contribution salary reduction savings plans under Section 401 K of the United States Internal Revenue Code, which provides for the Group to match a portion of each participating employees contribution, subject to certain limits.
By agreement with certain trade unions the Group makes pension contributions to union pension schemes in relation to some hotel employees who are union members.
The level of employer contributions is determined periodically by agreement between the unions concerned and the hotel operators who are party to union agreements which include pension provisions.
These hotel operators include certain group undertakings.
The hotel operators in these circumstances have certain obligations under United States employment legislation to ensure that such pension schemes are adequately funded.
Taiwan The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees.
The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit cost method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2001.
The contributions of the Company were set at 3.5% of the employees earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
It was assumed that the discount rate would be 3.5% per annum and that salary increases would average 3% per annum.
Average future service of participants expected to receive benefits was 14 years.
The net valuation is due in 2004.
The pension cost of the whole Group charged to the profit and loss account is 6.4m 2002: 5.3m.
Contributions of 0.4m 2002: 0.3m were due to the schemes as at 31 December 2003 and are included in creditors.
63 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 PENSION SCHEMES, EMPLOYEES AND REMUNERATION CONTINUED Financial Reporting Standard 17: The transitional arrangements of the new accounting standard FRS 17 require disclosure of pension scheme assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2003 calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
They also require disclosure of the items which would appear in the profit and loss account and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses were the full requirements of FRS 17 in place.
For the purpose of these financial statements, all of these figures are illustrative only and do not impact on the actual 31 December 2003 balance sheet or on this years performance statements.
Full adoption of FRS17 has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: UK Scheme Taiwan Scheme Per annum Per annum 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 %% % % % % Inflation 2.50 2.50 2.50 Salary increases 4.00 4.00 4.00 3.00 3.00 2.50 Rate of discount 5.34 5.14 5.75 3.50 3.75 4.50 Pension in payment increases 2.50 2.50 2.50 Revaluation rate for deferred pensioners 2.50 2.50 2.50 The Taiwan plan provides for a lump sum upon retirement based on a multiple of final salary.
The Company has no obligation once an employee leaves.
On this basis, the illustrative balance sheet figures are as follows: UK Taiwan Total Scheme Scheme Scheme 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m m m Assets 18.2 14.7 1.8 1.6 20.0 16.3 Liabilities 22.3 20.3 5.5 5.2 27.8 25.5 Deficit 4.1 5.6 3.7 3.6 7.8 9.2 Deferred tax 1.1 1.7 0.9 0.9 2.0 2.6 Net deficit 3.0 3.9 2.8 2.7 5.8 6.6 The above disclosed position is different to that determined for the long term funding of the Schemes, as different assumptions have been used.
Based on the net deficit at 31 December 2003, future full adoption of FRS 17 would result in a decrease in Group reserves at 31 December 2003 of 5.8m 2002: 6.6m.
The assets of the schemes at 31 December 2003 and corresponding expected returns over the following year are as follows :- UK Expected Taiwan Expected Fund value returns Fund value returns 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 m m m % % % m m m % % % Equities 14.5 11.2 12.7 6.59 6.39 7.00 Bonds 3.0 2.2 1.8 5.34 5.14 5.75 Cash 0.7 1.3 1.4 3.75 4.00 3.50 1.8 1.6 1.4 3.50 3.75 4.50 18.2 14.7 15.9 1.8 1.6 1.4 The fair value of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The present value of the schemes liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
64 Annual Report and Accounts 2003 30 PENSION SCHEMES, EMPLOYEES AND REMUNERATION CONTINUED The transitional disclosure arrangements of FRS 17 also require disclosure of the defined benefit pension related costs and movements which would have been included in the profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses, had full adoption of FRS 17 been made in the year ended 31 December 2003.
