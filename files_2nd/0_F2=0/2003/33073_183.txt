The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment medical plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
Accounting policies With effect from 1 January 2003, the Group accounts for pensions and similar benets under the United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17.
Figures for prior years have been restated.
In accordance with the new standard, the operating and nancing costs of dened benefit plans are recognised separately in the profit and loss account: service costs are systematically spread over the service lives of employees, and nancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The costs of individual events such as past service benefit enhancements, settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The liabilities and, where applicable, the assets of dened benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The charges to the profit and loss account for dened contribution plans are the company contributions payable and the assets of such plans are not included in the Group balance sheet.
All dened benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
Group policy is that the most important plans representing over 75% of the dened benefit liabilities are formally valued every year and other principal plans accounting for approximately a further 15% of liabilities have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for other plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
Prior to 1 January 2003, the Group accounted for pensions and similar obligations under the UK accounting standard SSAP 24.
The objective of that standard was to spread pension costs systematically over the service lives of employees and for the regular costs to be a reasonably stable percentage of pay.
In line with the accounting objectives, assumptions were generally set reecting long-term expectations and with asset values smoothed relative to market values.
Under SSAP 24, unlike FRS 17, all components of pension expense were recognised in operating profit.
Had the Group continued to account for pensions and similar obligations in 2003 under SSAP 24, the charge to operating profit would have been 561 million 2002: 416 million: 2001: 326 million, there would have been no charge to nancing cost and the charge to profit after tax would have been 361 million 2002: 261 million: 2001: 205 million.
No gains or losses would have been recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
Healthcare In December 2003 the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernisation Act became law in the US.
Under the provisions of this Act, the Groups US healthcare benefit plan will be able to benefit from a subsidy towards the cost of prescription drugs.
In order to be eligible to receive this subsidy it is expected that we will need to make minor changes to the rules of the Groups US plan.
Until these changes are made, no recognition of the drug subsidy is reected in the Group accounts.
Preliminary estimates indicate that once eligible, the Groups liability will reduce by approximately 55 million and the ongoing service cost would reduce by an immaterial amount.
Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2003 99 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Pensions and similar obligations continued FRS 17 Disclosures Assumptions With the objective of presenting pensions and other post-employment benefit plans assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions for FRS 17 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit pension plans covering approximately 90% of pension liabilities the principal pension plans and plans providing other post-employment benets, and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value, are: 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2001 Principal Other Principal Other Principal Other dened postdened postdened postbenefit employment benefit employment benefit employment pension benefit pension benefit pension benefit plans plans plans plans plans plans Discount rate 5.50% 6.10% 5.70% 6.50% 6.00% 7.25% Ination assumption 2.40% n a 2.30% n a 2.25% n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.70% 4.50% 3.60% 4.30% 3.50% 4.50% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.20% n a 2.20% n a 2.00% n a Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.60% n a 2.60% n a 1.50% n a a Long-term medical cost ination n a 4.90% n a 4.90% n a 5.00% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 8.40% 8.20% 9.00% Bonds 5.00% 4.90% 5.50% Others 6.40% 5.40% 6.00% a The valuations of other benefit plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost ination, which falls from 9.50% to the long-term rate within the next five years.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably depending on the economic conditions of the country where they are situated.
For the most important pension plans, representing over 75% of all dened benefit plans by liabilities, the assumptions used at 31 December 2003 and 2002 were: United Kingdom Netherlands United States Germany 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Discount rate 5.40% 5.50% 5.20% 5.40% 6.10% 6.50% 5.20% 5.40% Ination assumption 2.70% 2.25% 1.80% 2.25% 2.50% 2.50% 1.80% 2.00% Rate of increase in salaries 4.20% 3.75% 2.50% 3.00% 4.50% 4.50% 2.50% 2.75% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.80% 2.50% 1.80% 2.25% 0.00% 0.00% 1.80% 2.00% Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.80% 2.50% 1.80% 2.25% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 8.30% 8.00% 8.30% 8.30% 8.60% 8.30% 8.30% 8.30% Bonds 5.30% 4.90% 4.70% 4.70% 4.70% 4.30% 4.70% 4.70% Others 6.40% 5.80% 6.80% 5.60% 4.70% 4.30% 5.50% 4.90% 100 Unilever Annual Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2003 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Pensions and similar obligations continued Balance Sheet The assets, liabilities and surplus deficit position of the pension and other post-employment benefit plans and the expected rates of return on the plan assets, at the balance sheet date, were: million million % million million % million million % 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 Other postLong-term Other postLong-term Other postLong-term employment rates of employment rates of employment rates of Pension benefit return Pension benefit return Pension benefit return plans plans expected plans plans expected plans plans expected Assets of principal plans: Equities 8 054 8.4% 7 281 8.2% 10 494 9.0% Bonds 3 123 5.0% 3 383 4.9% 4 138 5.5% Other 1 582 6.4% 1 644 5.4% 1 808 6.0% Assets of other plans 272 3 7.5% 417 2 8.2% 536 3 8.0% Total plan assets 13 031 3 12 725 2 16 976 3 Present value of liabilities Principal plans 15 740 15 305 15 547 Other plans 1 052 1 078 1 675 1 042 1 781 1 171 Total present value of liabilities 16 792 1 078 16 980 1 042 17 328 1 171 Aggregate net surplus deficit of the plans 3 761 1 075 4 255 1 040 352 1 168 Irrecoverable surplus 116 87 265 Related deferred tax asset liability 814 379 1 058 388 74 467 Net pension asset liability 3 063 696 3 284 652 691 701 Of which in respect of Funded plans in surplus: Aggregate surplus 858 677 2 454 a Irrecoverable surplus 116 87 265 Related deferred tax liability 252 209 740 Net pension asset 490 381 1 449 Funded plans in deficit: Aggregate deficit 2 294 2 575 607 Related deferred tax asset 665 808 199 Net pension liability 1 629 1 767 408 Unfunded plans: Aggregate liability 2 325 1 075 2 357 1 040 2 199 1 168 Related deferred tax asset 401 379 459 388 467 467 Net pension liability 1 924 696 1 898 652 1 732 701 a The surplus in the plans is only recoverable to the extent that the Group can benefit from either refunds formally agreed or future contribution reductions.

In 2003, the benets paid in respect of unfunded plans amounted to 295 million 2002: 260 million: 2001: 352 million.
Company contributions to funded plans have been at a reduced level for a number of years resulting from the generally strong stock market performance of the 1990s.
Following the falls in stock markets in 2000, 2001 and 2002, contribution holidays are ending for many Unilever plans and the aggregate level of contributions is now rising.
In 2003, contributions to funded dened benefit plans, including one-off contributions of 32 million, amounted to 170 million 2002: 140 million: 2001: 214 million net refund.
The contributions in 2001 were net of a 221 million refund in the Netherlands and a 76 million refund in Finland.
In 2003 a refund of 7 million was received in Finland out of previously irrecoverable surplus.
Contributions are subject to periodic review and current expectations are that in 2004 contributions will restart or increase in a number of countries.
Total contributions to funded plans and benefit payments by the Group in respect of unfunded plans are expected to be about 850 million in 2004.
This includes one-off contributions to funded plans in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Austria of approximately 145 million.

The accounting methodology however is not the same as under FRS 17, since under US GAAP all costs are recognised in operating profit and certain cost items are amortised in the profit and loss account rather than recognised immediately.
The disclosures below show the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and balance sheet impact, as well as the periodic expense, cash ows and related economic assumptions associated with the dened benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans as computed in accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 106.
Measurement dates All plan assets are valued at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Liabilities in respect of the most important pension plans comprising approximately 75% of the pension liabilities are subject to actuarial valuations every year.
The valuations use membership data for the current year with the liability projected forward to the balance sheet date.
Valuations of all other plans are carried out every three years and in the case of the other principal pension plans, comprising approximately a further 15% of the liabilities, the valuations are updated each year.

Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the company of the benets provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversied, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The Group also keeps a proportion of assets invested in bonds, property and cash.
Most assets are managed by a number of external fund managers, with a small proportion managed in house.

This includes both mandatory and discretionary payments.
In addition, a further 30 million is expected to be contributed to dened contribution plans.
The table below shows the expected benefit payments from dened benefit plans.
The benets paid from funded plans include amounts funded by employee contributions.
The benets paid in respect of unfunded plans are made from the Groups cash resources.
