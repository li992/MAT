notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Companys profit and loss account The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The loss for the year of the Company amounted to 7,639 million 2002 loss of 6,696 million, 2001 - profit of 810 million.
2 Historical cost profits and losses There is no difference between the Group results as reported and on the historical cost basis.
Accordingly no additional note of historical cost profits and losses has been prepared.
3 Turnover The Groups operations are all considered to fall into one class of business, namely telecommunications.
4 Segmental information Cable & Wireless is an international telecommunications company.
During the periods presented it operated through two segments, Cable & Wireless Global and Cable & Wireless Regional, which can be further analysed by geographic area.
Cable & Wireless Global provides communication solutions to business and wholesale customers.
It offers IP, data and voice products with a focus on IP and data, centred on the key markets of US, Europe including UK and Japan.
Cable & Wireless Regional provides a full range of telecommunications services to both consumer and business customers, including xed and mobile voice, data and IP.
The major businesses in this segment are in the Caribbean and Panama, but it also includes operations in Macau, the Middle East, South East Asia and in the Pacic, Indian and Atlantic Oceans.
Details of Group turnover, contributions to operating loss profit, net operating assets liabilities by geographical region are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 Turnover m m m Cable & Wireless Global US 512 530 503 UK 1,728 2,075 2,158 Europe 304 305 251 Japan 323 361 450 2,867 3,271 3,362 Cable & Wireless Regional Caribbean including Panama 1,062 1,150 1,066 Asia including Sakhalin 154 156 199 Other 195 160 168 1,411 1,466 1,433 Inter-regional turnover 31 34 107 Continuing operations 4,247 4,703 4,688 Discontinued operations 144 1,045 3,163 Group turnover 4,391 5,748 7,851 Page 95 notes to the financial statements The Group turnover gure disclosed represents turnover of the Company and its subsidiaries allocated to the location to which the Group invoices its services.
This is generally the same as the location to which telecommunications services are supplied.
It does not follow, however, that international telecommunications trafc which the Group may be responsible for carrying on part of its route would necessarily originate in that location.
The Group does not have access to information on the original source or ultimate destination of international telecommunications trafc.
Turnover for 2001 and 2002 has been adjusted to reect the introduction of UITF Abstract 36 Contracts for sales of capacity see below and for operations now classied as discontinued.
Discontinued operations comprise sales in the US in 2003 of 144 million 2002 US 281 million and Australia 764 million, 2001 US 354 million, Australia 1,815 million, Hong Kong 878 million and UK 116 million.
The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 36 for the year ended 31 March 2003.
The requirements of UITF Abstract 36 have been incorporated into a revised accounting policy for capacity sales.
Accordingly the amounts for the current and corresponding periods have been updated on the basis of the new accounting policy.
The impact of this change for the 12 months to 31 March 2003 is to decrease turnover by nil 2002 163 million, 2001 248 million in respect of sales made to carriers from whom capacity was also acquired, and to decrease cost of sales by nil 2002 76 million, 2001 123 million.
In respect of capacity purchases from carriers to whom Cable & Wireless also sold capacity, the net impact is to decrease the impairment charge in 2002 by 105 million, decrease the depreciation charge in 2003 by 2 million 2002 12 million, 2001 9 million and decrease exceptional operating costs by 3 million 2002 128 million, 2001 nil.
The impact on profit for the year ended 31 March 2003 is an increase of 6 million 2002 increase of 168 million, 2001 decrease of 117 million.
The cumulative effect of adopting UITF Abstract 36 was to decrease net assets by 66 million as at 31 March 2002.
Cash capacity sales of nil 2002 29 million, 2001 91 million are included within Group turnover, with attributable cost of sales of nil 2002 10 million, 2001 37 million.
Revenue from operating and maintenance and similar services relating to capacity was 11 million 2002 37 million, 2001 30 million, with cost of sales of 2 million 2002 16 million, 2001 13 million.

8 Pensions Dened benefit schemes The Company and its principal subsidiaries operate pension and other retirement schemes which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
These schemes include both the dened benefit type, whereby retirement benets are based on the employeesnal remuneration and length of service, and dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets reect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
With the exception of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes, the remaining schemes are funded through separate trustee administered schemes.
Contributions to the dened benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes at regular intervals, usually triennially.
An actuarial valuation of the principal United Kingdom dened benefit pension scheme the Scheme was prepared at 31 March 2002 for the purpose of UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The valuation of the Scheme disclosed a shortfall in the market value of the Schemes assets compared with the accrued liabilities.
This was principally due to the fall in the Schemes asset values following the fall in global equity markets between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2002.
Thus, with agreement from the actuary, the Company increased its contributions to the Scheme to 20 per cent of salary with effect from 1 April 2002, and made a one-off contribution to the Scheme of 47 million in December 2002 in respect of the shortfall.
The Scheme was valued using the projected unit method and the principal assumptions were that future investment returns on existing assets would, on average, be 3.2 per cent a year above the level of price ination, that the return on new investments would be 3.9 per cent a year above price ination, that general salary growth would be 1.7 per cent a year above price ination, and that ination related pension increases would generally be in line with price ination.
The market value of the Schemes investments at the valuation date was 1,401 million.
The Scheme also holds some insurance policies which have an assessed value of 11 million.
The total value of the assets was 97 per cent of the value of the aggregate benets that had accrued to members of the Scheme, allowing for expected future earnings increases in the case of employees.
The assumptions used for calculating the pension cost for accounting purposes differ from the funding assumptions in that the assumed return on existing assets is 3.3 per cent a year above price ination.
In the financial statements, the deficit in the Scheme is spread over the remaining service lives of the employed members.
Under those assumptions as at 31 March 2002, the total value of the investments was 99 per cent of the value of the aggregate benets that had accrued to members of the Scheme.
The pension costs as shown in Note 6 comprise: 2003 2002 m m Regular costs 22 20 Variation from regular costs including interest 9 8 31 12 Pension schemes other than the principal scheme are accounted for on the basis of local custom and practice.
Pension prepayments relating to the Scheme of 112 million 2002 72 million, 2001 64 million are included in other debtors Note 20.
Provisions for obligations to pay terminal gratuities on retirement to staff who are not members of the pension and retirement schemes are included in provisions for pensions Note 23.
Page 100 notes to the financial statements Dened contribution schemes The pension cost for the year for the dened contribution schemes was 19 million 2002 10 million, 2001 26 million.
Disclosures in respect of Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 Retirement benets The above gures have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24.
The UK has published FRS 17, however, its full introduction has been deferred.
The accounting requirements of FRS 17 are broadly as follows: r pension scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date: r pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality AA corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability: r for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the pension scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit will be recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet: and r the movement in the scheme surplus deficit will be split between operating charges, nancing items and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The transitional disclosures in respect of FRS 17 are set out below: Qualied independent actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, updated the actuarial valuations of the major dened benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 March 2003.
The main financial assumptions in accordance with FRS 17 are as follows: 2003 2002 Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group %%%% Ination assumption 2.5 4.3 2.5 4.9 Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 5.6 4.3 6.3 Pension increases 2.5-3.0 3.6 2.5-3.0 3.6 Deferred pension increases 2.5 3.0 2.5 Discount rate 5.5 6.9 5.8 7.5 Long term expected rate of return on: Equities 8.5 9.1 7.8 9.6 Bonds 5.0 7.1 5.5 7.3 Other 4.0 4.8 4.5 4.6 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions shown above for the Rest of Group represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual funds.
The UK dened benefit scheme is closed to new entrants and under the projected unit method for closed schemes the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

Page 120 notes to the financial statements The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust, is a discretionary trust which has been funded by loans from the Company to acquire shares in Cable and Wireless plc.
The cost of running the Trust is included in the profit and loss account.
The Trustees of the plan may notionally allocate Ordinary Shares in the Company annually to Executive Directors or other senior executives and other key staff.
Shares are held in trust until such time as they may be transferred to employees in accordance with the terms of the Performance Share Plan, the Restricted Share Plan, the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan, details of which are given in the Directors Remuneration Report, and the Share Option Plan, details of which are given below.
The shares will be provided from existing Ordinary Shares in issue acquired by the Trustees.
The expected cost of all these shares is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the relevant scheme.
Surplus shares may be held to satisfy future awards.
The Trust has waived its rights to dividends.
At 31 March 2003, there were 26,754 shares under options in relation to the Long Term Incentive Plan, 8,710,393 shares under contingent awards in relation to the Performance Share Plan, 763,283 shares under restricted share awards in relation to the Restricted Share Plan, 44,109 shares under the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan and 76,210,041 shares under options in relation to the Share Option Plan.
Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme Under the Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE scheme, UK employees can enter a savings contract with a bank to save regular monthly sums of between 5 and 250 for a period of either three or five years.
At the end of the savings contract, the participant receives interest from the bank on their savings.
The savings and the interest may then be used to exercise an option over Ordinary Shares of the Company which are issued at a discount of 20 per cent to the market value of the Companys Ordinary Shares at the date of grant.
The Company has extended the SAYE scheme to its overseas employees by the Cable & Wireless Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme GSAYE scheme.
The GSAYE scheme is offered throughout the Groups territories with the exception of the UK and US and it operates along similar lines to the SAYE scheme with local variances to accommodate local legal and tax considerations.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption contained in UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes not to recognise a charge to the profit and loss account in respect of its Inland Revenue approved SAYE scheme.
Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme Prior to July 2001, Cable & Wireless granted share options under the Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme RESOS.
Options awarded under this plan between June 1999 and July 2001 are subject to performance based conditions based on Cable & Wireless Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 Index, underpinned by real growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and turnover.
For full vesting, Cable & Wireless TSR must achieve at least upper quartile level against the FTSE 100 between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Half vesting applies for TSR at the median level, with a sliding scale between median and upper quartiles.
If the performance conditions are not met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse.
As at the date of this report, no such options have achieved their performance conditions.
Options granted under RESOS before June 1999 became exercisable if growth in Companys published earnings per share excluding exceptional items measured over any period of three consecutive financial years, commencing not earlier than the financial year in which the option was granted, exceeded by not less than 6 per cent the percentage growth of the Retail Price Index over the same three year period.
All such options became exercisable in full.
No further grants will be made under the RESOS plan.
Cable & Wireless Share Option Plan The Share Option Plan is the principal vehicle for long-term retention and incentivisation for the Executive Directors, other executives and key staff.
The level of any award is determined by the Remuneration Committee each year by reference to total remuneration within a market peer group, subject to an overriding annual limit of six times salary for the Chief Executive and four times salary for other Executive Directors.
The vesting of share options awarded to the Executive Directors and to all employees outside the United States is subject to relative TSR performance conditions.
Full vesting occurs only if the TSR performance of the Company meets or exceeds the Page 121 notes to the financial statements upper quartile between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Where TSR performance meets the median, 50 per cent of the initial award vests.
A sliding scale operates between median and upper quartile, and nothing vests for TSR performance below the median.
If performance conditions have not been met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse.
Performance conditions are applied in determining the level of awards to employees in the United States, but do not normally apply to the vesting of such awards.
In addition, 25 per cent of awards to employees in the United States vest on the first anniversary of the date of the grant with a further 25 per cent on each subsequent anniversary.
These terms reect normal practice in the United States.
Cable & Wireless Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company also offers employees of its US subsidiaries the Cable & Wireless Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP which is a section 423 qualied plan under the US Internal Revenue Code 1986.
Under ESPP, employees can save over a one year period sums of between US$10 and US$800 per payroll payment.
At the end of each period the employees have the option to purchase ADRs in the Company at a 15 per cent discount to the market price of an ADR at the date of grant.
Each ADR represents three Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan The Company also offers its employees who are chargeable to income tax, under Section 15 Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003, the Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan the Plan which is a Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan.
Under the Plan, employees can contribute between 5 and 125 per month, or 10 per cent of pre tax salary each month, whichever is the lower, to buy partnership shares in the Company.

The Company carries investments in subsidiary undertakings at valuation.
Provisions for impairment have been made in respect of some of the Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings.
The Directors have considered the value of the Companys other xed assets and are satisfied that the aggregate value of those assets which have not actually been revalued was not less than the aggregate amount at which they are stated in the Companys accounts.
Thus, under section 275 6 of the Companies Act 1985 the relevant items as mentioned in section 270 2 of the Act are accordingly regarded as stated in the Companys accounts on the basis that a revaluation of all of the Companys xed assets took place at that time.
Consequently, the provisions for impairment are deemed by section 275 of the Companies Act 1985 to be an unrealised loss.
Exchange adjustments in the Group are net of exchange profits of 20 million 2002 27 million, 2001 losses of 39 million on foreign currency borrowings.
The cumulative amount of goodwill charged to reserves in prior years as a result of acquisitions, net of goodwill written back through the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses, amounted to 475 million 2002 475 million, 2001 885 million.
Of this amount 441 million 2002 441 million, 2001 441 million related to joint ventures and associates.
26 Financial instruments An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments is set out in the Treasury activities and policies section of the Operating and Financial Review on pages 36 to 40.
For the purpose of the disclosures which follow in this note, short term debtors and creditors which arise directly from the Groups operations have been excluded from financial assets and liabilities as permitted under Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures except for currency risk disclosures.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments which play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk prole of the Group.
An analysis of the carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is given in the fair value table on page 126.
Interest rate management The interest rate prole of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 March 2003, after taking account of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, is set out in the table below: NonNonFloating Fixed interest Floating Fixed interest rate rate bearing 2003 rate rate bearing 2002 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 121 667 788 219 428 647 US$ 104 119 449 672 122 408 914 1,444 Yen 74 74 13 147 160 Other 75 12 17 8 232 865 449 1,546 355 990 914 2,259 The oating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest at rates xed in advance for periods ranging from one week to six months by reference to LIBOR for sterling and US dollar borrowings.
The non-interest bearing financial liabilities comprise 449 million 2002 914 million of the zero coupon exchangeable bonds, which are exchangeable into ordinary shares of PCCW.
The bonds were issued on 9 April 2001 at 100 per cent of their US$1,504 million principal amount.
During the year the Group purchased US$600 million 2002 US$200 million of the principal amount of the bonds at a discount to their face value.
This resulted in a gain of US$15 million 10 million, Page 123 notes to the financial statements 2002 US$10 million 7 million which is recognised in the current year profit and loss account in full.
Subject to the conditions of the bonds, the bondholders had the option to exchange the bonds into ordinary shares of PCCW at any time prior to the close of business on 2 June 2003.
The Company had the option to redeem the bonds at their principal amount provided that the market value of the ordinary shares of PCCW on such dealing day is greater than 120 per cent of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bonds on each of 15 of any 20 consecutive dealing days.
Unless previously purchased or redeemed on exchange or otherwise, the bonds will be redeemed at their principal amount on 9 June 2003.
The Group has a net asset of 4 million 2002 1 million net liability resulting from the fair value of forward exchange contracts entered into before 31 March 2003.
This has been excluded from the preceding table.
The weighted average interest rates for the xed rate financial liabilities of the Group at 31 March 2003, together with the periods for which the rates were xed, are set out in the table below: 2003 2002 Weighted Weighted Weighted average Weighted average average period for average period for interest which rate interest which rate rate is xed rate is xed Currency % Months % Months Sterling 7.9 95 8.6 154 US$ 5.4 82 6.2 42 Yen 3.7 62 2.6 58 Other 10.9 114 10.9 121 7.3 91 6.7 94 The interest and other similar income rate prole of the financial assets of the Group at 31 March 2003, after taking account of interest rate swaps, is set out in the table below: NonNonFloating interest Floating interest rate bearing 2003 rate bearing 2002 Currency m m m m m m Sterling 2,404 87 2,491 3,575 176 3,751 US$ 623 11 634 1,077 17 1,094 Yen 12 1 13 22 8 30 HK$ 1 254 255 2 546 548 Other 125 5 130 212 8 220 3,165 358 3,523 4,888 755 5,643 The oating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and short term deposits.
Of the total, approximately 90 per cent is held by the Groups central treasury operations as sterling and US dollar cash deposits with short term maturities based on LIBOR and maturities ranging between one and 12 months.
At 31 March 2003, the Group had no financial assets upon which xed income was earned during that year.
The non-interest bearing financial assets are held in the form of shares.
During the year the Company purchased 75 million of credit linked notes issued by an AA-rated bank and referenced to the 200 million bond maturing in 2012.
Two notes of 25 million and 50 million were purchased with maturities of September 2003 and July 2004 respectively.
The transactions have a similar economic effect to repurchasing the referenced bonds for the period of the investment.
The notes pay interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 151 basis points.
Page 124 notes to the financial statements In return for receiving interest on the credit linked notes at rates in excess of LIBOR the final redemption to be received by the Company is determined by certain circumstances related to the credit risk of the Company.
These circumstances arise if there has been a credit event as dened in the terms of the note, in which case the counterparties may redeem the notes at less than par value.
A credit event arises in the event of any of the following circumstances in respect of Cable and Wireless plc only: bankruptcy: failure to make any payment due under any of its debt obligations, after expiration of any grace period and subject to a threshold of 25 million: and restructuring of any of its debt subject to a threshold of 25 million.
If a credit event should take place, the credit linked note is unlikely to be redeemed for cash.
Instead the Company is likely to receive its own bonds or debt obligations with a par value equivalent to that of the credit linked notes in settlement of redemption of the note.
Exchange risk management The following table shows the Groups currency exposures at 31 March 2003 on currency transactions that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas companies.

Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity proles of the Groups financial liabilities, as listed in the fair value table on page 126, are disclosed in Note 22.
Borrowing facilities The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 March 2003, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date, were as follows: 2003 2002 m m Expiring within one year 30 90 Expiring in year two 30 30 120 Page 125 notes to the financial statements Fair value The estimated fair value of the Groups financial instruments are summarised below: 2003 2002 Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Trade investments 85 126 86 86 Cash 196 196 216 216 Short term deposits 2,958 2,958 4,063 4,063 Current asset investments 246 246 1,155 1,196 Net investment in finance lease receivables 15 15 Loans and obligations under finance leases due within one year 376 378 237 237 Convertible bonds 449 447 914 882 Other loans and obligations under finance leases due after more than one year 721 681 1,108 1,148 Other creditors falling due after more than one year 86 86 9 9 Derivative financial instruments held to manage interest rate and currency exposure Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps assets 3 21 liabilities 1 3 Cross currency swaps assets 11 35 35 liabilities 16 16 26 28 Forward exchange contracts 74 1 1 Trade investments Trade investments above are detailed in Note 17 but exclude ESOP shares carried at 38 million 2002 123 million with a fair value of 38 million 2002 87 million.
The fair value is based on year end quoted prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales proceeds for other investments.
Cash at bank and in hand, short term deposits and short term borrowings The carrying value approximates to fair value either because of the short maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate on investments is reset after periods not greater than six months.
Current asset investments The fair value is based on market value or estimates of likely sales proceeds.
Convertible bonds and other long term debt The fair value is based on quoted market prices or, where these are not available, on the quoted market prices of comparable debt issued by other companies.
Forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps The fair value of forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the swaps at the balance sheet date.
This takes into consideration current interest rates, current exchange rates and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties.
The nominal value of swaps at 31 March 2003 was 2,146 million 2002 5,206 million.
Page 126 notes to the financial statements Forward exchange contracts The value of these contracts is the estimated amount which the Group would expect to pay or receive on the termination of the contracts.
This takes into consideration current interest rates and current exchange rates.
At 31 March 2003 the Group had 406 million of such contracts outstanding 2002 107 million.
Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging excluding hedges that have been accounted for by adjusting the carrying value of a xed asset recognised on the balance sheet, and on the underlying asset or liability, are as follows: Net gains Gains Losses losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges At 1 April 2002 88 72 16 Recognised during the year 53 4 49 Arising in the year that were not recognised during the year 32 64 32 At 31 March 2003 3 4 1 Of which: Expected to be recognised in less than one year 3 3 Expected to be recognised in after more than one year 1 1 The above net unrecognised loss is a reection of different market interest rates ruling at 31 March 2003.
27 Commitments and contingent liabilities Commitments Capital commitments at the end of the financial year, for which no provision has been made, are as follows: Group Company 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Contracted 135 367 The Group gures above exclude amounts payable for certain network assets to be ordered by August 2005 under a take or pay contract.
During the year this contract was re-negotiated.
The 16 million committed and payable under the amended contract has been provided for as at 31 March 2003.
In addition to the capital commitments above the Group has a number of operating commitments arising in the ordinary course of the Groups business.
The most significant of these relate to network operating and maintenance costs, and outsourcing arrangements in the UK and US for the provision of certain services including human resources and information technology systems management.
In respect of operating and maintenance costs, in the event of default of another party, the Group may be liable to additional contributions under the terms of the agreements.
Page 127 notes to the financial statements Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities at the end of the financial year for which no provision or disclosure has been made elsewhere in the financial statements are as follows: Group Company 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Trading guarantees 181 154 181 154 Other guarantees 489 547 181 154 670 701 Upon re-examination of the Groups trading guarantees the comparative for 2002 has been amended to 154 million.
Trading guarantees principally comprise performance bonds or contracts issued in the normal course of business guaranteeing the Group will meet its obligations to complete projects in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.
The guarantees also enable the customer to obtain repayment of any advance payment in the event of the relevant subsidiary failing to carry out its contractual obligations in full.
Some of these guarantees are uncapped.
The nature of contracts includes projects, service level agreements, installation of equipment, surveys, purchase of equipment and transportation of materials.
The guarantees contain a clause that they will be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the contract.
Other guarantees include guarantees in respect of the financial obligations of subsidiary undertakings principally in respect of leases, borrowings and letters of credit.
Pender Insurance Limited Pender, the Groups Isle of Man insurance subsidiary, has written policies in favour of the Group and third parties.
significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party policies.
Pender is currently taking legal advice and it intends to defend vigorously these claims, and has notied its reinsurers where appropriate.
The Board of Pender, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets determined that no provision was required in its financial statements for these claims for the year ended 31 March 2003.
As certain of the insurance claims have not yet been fully quantied or substantiated by the claimants, it is not currently practicable to estimate their financial effects.
Since 31 March 2003, Pender has ceased to write third party insurance.
Other matters In addition the Company has, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years.
Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given.
In relation to the sale of CWC ConsumerCo, the Company gave a number of standard warranties and indemnities.
There is no time limit or cap that applies generally.
The Company also gave warranties and indemnities in relation to facility sharing agreements.
The Directors do not expect any of these guarantees to result in a material loss to the Group or Company.

Included within liquid resources are amounts totalling 48 million 2002 47 million held by the Groups insurance subsidiary.
These assets are actively managed to meet insurance liabilities.
These assets are required to meet insurance solvency requirements and, as a result, are not all readily available for the general purposes of the Group.
Other short term deposits typically include bank deposits, excluding those which are repayable on demand, commercial paper and government securities.
These deposits have short maturities and a high turnover arising from rollover as part of the Groups treasury management activities.

34 Legal Proceedings Class action litigation against Cable and Wireless plc Between December 2002 and February 2003, ten shareholder class action lawsuits were led in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia naming Cable and Wireless plc and several of its ofcers and directors as defendants.
In March 2003, the court consolidated all of the cases into one action, styled as In re Cable and Wireless plc Securities Litigation, Civil Action No.
The Court has appointed Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board, an institutional investor located in Canada, and Alex Osinski, a U. S. citizen, as co-lead plaintiffs collectively lead plaintiffs to prosecute on behalf of all plaintiffs.
In May 2003, the lead plaintiffs led a consolidated complaint that alleges violations of certain sections of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder.
A central allegation is that the defendants made false and misleading statements about the Companys financial condition by failing to disclose on a timely basis the existence of a tax indemnity and a ratings trigger to place money in escrow until any liability which the Company may have had under the tax indemnity was nally determined.
The indemnity and ratings trigger appear in an agreement between the Company and Deutsche Telekom for the sale of the Companys interest in the mobile telephone company that operated under the name One2One.
In addition to the allegations relating to the tax indemnity, the consolidated complaint also alleges that the defendants made false and misleading statements by: 1 failing to disclose certain lease liability commitments and 2 improperly recognising revenue received from sales of capacity to other carriers.
The plaintiffs seek unspecified money damages in their complaints.
Cable & Wireless believes that it has meritorious defences to these claims and intends to vigorously defend itself in this litigation.
Page 131 notes to the financial statements Dispute with IBM UK Limited Disputes between 1 Cable and Wireless plc and IBM United Kingdom Limited, 2 Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and International Business Machines Corporation and 3 IBM Japan Limited and Cable & Wireless IDC Incorporated collectively Cable & Wireless and IBM respectively have arisen out of a Global Framework Agreement GFA dated 20 December 2000, and related agreements, pursuant to which IBM agreed to supply to Cable & Wireless information technology services.
In order to monitor the quality of the services provided by IBM, including price and service levels, the GFA contains benchmarking provisions, which set out the processes and procedures by which the services provided by IBM are to be assessed against a pre-determined objective.
In February 2002, the parties engaged Compass America Inc Compass to conduct a benchmark for the 14 month period from 1 January 2001 to 28 February 2002, the results of which revealed significant levels of overcharging by IBM.
Disputes arose as to whether the GFA obliged IBM to repay to Cable & Wireless the amounts that the benchmark established it has been overcharged and as to whether the Compass reports were valid both in terms of their substance and conformity with the GFA benchmarking requirements.
On 4 July 2002, the Company issued proceedings for a declaration that it is entitled to compensation from IBM UK for any period of overcharging, including past overcharging, and to compensation in respect of overcharging as identied by Compass.
After an inconclusive Court-ordered mediation that took place in December 2002, the Court ordered an expedited trial of all matters in issue between the parties.
Full pleadings were then exchanged.
Cable & Wireless seeks a declaration as to the meaning of certain overcharging related provisions of the GFA and compensation for overcharging by IBM.
From January 2001 to the date Cable & Wireless proceedings were issued, its claim in respect of overcharging by IBM amounts to approximately 115 million in respect of the United Kingdom and approximately US$22 million in respect of the United States.
For each month that IBM refuses to reduce its charges a further substantial overcharge arises.
IBM UK and IBM US seek the declaration in respect of the Compass reports referred to above and IBM UK has brought counterclaims in respect of work it alleges Cable & Wireless should have given to it under the GFA and claims damages to be assessed.
IBM Japan Limited seeks payment of certain charges allegedly due and payable to it by Cable & Wireless IDC Inc.
Subsequently, on 21 February 2003, the Court directed that Cable & Wireless claim as to the meaning of certain overcharging related provisions of the GFA should be heard separately from the other claims and counterclaims as a preliminary issue.
The preliminary issue has been set for trial in September 2003.
Cable & Wireless believes that it has meritorious defences to the counter claims asserted by IBM and intends to vigorously defend itself in this litigation.
Claim by APCC Services, Inc. and others On 30 March 2001, a complaint was led in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and was served on Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. on 25 June 2001.
The complaint was led by a group of billing and collection agents on behalf of hundreds of entities that own and operate public payphones throughout the United States.
The complaint alleges that Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. violated the US Communications Act and the rules, regulations, and orders of the Federal Communications Commission by not adequately compensating the independent payphone operators for toll free and access code calls that were made from the independent payphone operators payphones and carried over Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. s network.
The complaint seeks approximately US$5 million in monetary damages.
In August 2001, Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and the plaintiff entered into a tolling agreement whereby the obligations of the parties in litigation would be suspended until 1 November 2001, while the parties attempted to resolve the dispute informally.
Plaintiffs refiled their complaint which is now pending in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
The parties agreed to a condential, non-binding, thirdparty neutral evaluation for settlement purposes which is currently ongoing.
Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to the claims.
If the dispute is not resolved through the neutral evaluation process, Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. intends to vigorously defend the action.
Litigation against Digital Island, Inc. Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. As described in Business Description History, in 2002 Cable & Wireless acquired 100 per cent of Digital Island, which is now known as Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc.
Page 132 notes to the financial statements Akamai Technologies, Inc. Akamai and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT led a patent infringement suit against Digital Island on 13 September 2000 in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that a version of Digital Islands content delivery service infringes a patent owned by MIT and licensed exclusively to Akamai.
On 20 September 2000, Akamai and MIT led a further claim alleging infringement by Digital Island of a second Akamai patent.
On 21 December 2001, a jury invalidated three of the claims related to one of the Akamai patents.
The jury also found that Digital Island infringed one independent claim and three dependent claims of this patent.
Digital Island was found not to have infringed the other patent.
On 23 August 2002, the Court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting further infringement of certain of the surviving claims.
Cable & Wireless has revised its content delivery service at little cost to and with no other effect on its customers in such a way that Cable & Wireless believes that the infringement no longer exists and that the injunction is of no effect.
Nevertheless, on 17 September 2002, Akamai led a contempt motion with the Court asserting that Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. is violating the injunction by continuing to infringe the surviving Akamai claims.
The Court denied Akamais motion on 1 November 2002.
A damages trial has not yet been scheduled on the infringed claims.
On 22 January 2003, Akamai led a patent infringement suit against Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that the Cable & Wireless content delivery service infringes a recently-issued patent owned by Akamai.
Upon motion by Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. the case was transferred to the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
On 22 April 2003, Akamai led a patent infringement suit against Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the Cable & Wireless content delivery service infringes a patent issued to Akamai that same day.
Akamai has not yet effected service of the complaint in this case.
On 29 August 2002, Teknowledge Corporation Teknowledge led a patent infringement suit against Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. Akamai, and Inktomi Corporation in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that the content delivery service of each defendant infringes a patent owned by Teknowledge.
Upon motion by Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. the case was transferred to the District Court for the Northern District of California.
Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to the outstanding claims asserted in these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself in these cases.
Class actions against Digital Island, Inc. in connection with its initial public offering In August 2001, Digital Island became aware that two purported shareholder class action lawsuits were led in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York naming Digital Island as a defendant along with certain of its present and former ofcers and directors and alleging violations of certain sections of the Securities Act 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act 1934.
The actions which now include a third suit making virtually identical claims and allegations allege that the Registration Statement and Prospectus through which Digital Island conducted its initial public offering IPO in June 1999 was false and misleading because it failed to disclose, amongst other things, that: i the underwriters of the IPO allegedly had solicited and received excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors in exchange for which the underwriters allocated to those investors material portions of the restricted number of Digital Island shares issued in connection with the IPO: and ii the underwriters allegedly had entered into agreements with customers whereby the underwriters agreed to allocate Digital Island shares to those customers in the IPO in exchange for which the customers agreed to purchase additional Digital Island shares in the after market at pre-determined prices.
On 15 July 2002, Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. moved to dismiss all claims against it.
On 19 February 2003, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.
Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. is now engaged in settlement discussions with the plaintiffs.
Notwithstanding this Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to these claims and, should the settlement discussions prove unsuccessful, intends to vigorously defend itself in any such litigation.

Dali a former subsidiary of Cable & Wireless, and certain of the then present and former directors of Digital Island, have been named as defendants in six separate putative class action lawsuits alleging various claims arising out of Cable & Wireless acquisition of Digital Island in August 2001.
Three of the lawsuits were led in the US District Court for the District of Delaware and three were led in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The three federal lawsuits were consolidated into a single case, and, while the plaintiffs motion to consolidate the three state cases was granted on 24 April 2002, the plaintiffs have yet to le a consolidated, amended complaint.
The federal suit alleged that the defendants violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose on a timely basis that Digital Island had entered into certain business agreements with Bloomberg, L. P. and Major League Baseball.
It further alleged that compensation agreements with certain ofcers and or directors of the company violated the federal securities all-holders rule.
One state lawsuit alleged violations of Delaware law based upon similar allegations.
The other two state lawsuits alleged various violations of Delaware law against the same corporate defendants and the present and former Digital Island directors, including that they failed to disclose all material facts relating to Digital Islands relationship with Microsoft, and that they failed to obtain a fair price for Digital Island shares.
On 10 September 2002, a federal judge granted the defendants motion to dismiss the federal lawsuits with prejudice.
Plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Cable & Wireless believes that it and its subsidiaries have meritorious defences to the claims asserted in these lawsuits, and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in that litigation as well should the plaintiffs pursue those claims.
Litigation with Cibertec International, S. A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S. A. Cibertec International, S. A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S. A. initiated proceedings against Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. and Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited in Panama on 29 October 1999.
The claim is for approximately US$125 million and alleges breach of contract.
On 18 November 2002, the Panamanian Circuit Court handed down a decision against Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. awarding damages of US$67,255,000, including moral damages and costs.
The Court decided that Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. had failed to maintain in sufficient confidence certain of the proprietary information of the plaintiffs.
Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. appealed the judgement on 3 December 2002 and intends to pursue this appeal vigorously.
Pending the resolution of its appeal, Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. is not obliged to pay, and has not paid, any of the awards against it.
Claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy On 16 December 2002, a complaint was led at the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama against the Minister of Finance and Economy in Panama alleging that the Operating Agreement executed between Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited and INTEL, S. A. now Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. as part of the privatisation agreements was null and void ab initio, on the grounds that it had not been published in the Ofcial Gazette in Panama.
On 21 March 2003, the Court admitted the claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy.
Panamanian counsel consider this claim to be without merit and none of Cable and Wireless plc, Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. or Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited are parties to the complaint.
However, if the complaint were to be successful and the Operating Agreement declared null and void, then the complainants could le a complaint against Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited requiring the return of all management fees collected under the agreement since its execution.
This would amount to approximately 60 million.
In the event that this complaint is successful, Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries intends to vigorously pursue any legal recourse available to them.
Claim by Caribtel Caribbean Limited On 9 May 2003, Caribtel Caribbean Limited, a telecommunications operator specialising in calling cards, led a suit against Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in the Supreme Court of Judicature of Jamaica.
Caribtel has alleged that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited wrongfully disconnected Caribtels local access telephone services, resulting in a breach of contract and a violation of the Jamaican Fair Competition Act and the Telecommunications Act.
Caribtel is claiming US$50 million of lost income to its pre-paid local access calling card business for the period from 25 April 2003 to 25 April 2006.
Caribtel has also claimed aggravated and or exemplary damages of Jamaica $300 million approximately 2.94 million and is seeking injunctive relief to have Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited reinstate Caribtels local access telephone service.
Page 134 notes to the financial statements On 22 May 2003, Caribtel presented a petition for injunctive relief before the Supreme Court of Jamaica requesting that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited be required to reinstate Caribtels local access telephone service: be restrained from disconnecting any other telecommunications facility currently supplied to Caribtels business premises until trial: and be prevented from calling on a prior bank guarantee that Caribtel had provided to Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in conjunction with a settlement agreement entered into between the parties in February 2003 relating to breaches of contract by Caribtel in December 2002.
The injunctions were not granted by the court.
However, Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited gave an undertaking that it would not disconnect the direct internet access facility pending a hearing scheduled for 2 June 2003.
Prior to the hearing of 2 June 2003, Caribtel approached Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited with a view to arriving at a settlement.
The parties entered into negotiations as a result of which the matter was taken off the court list by consent of both parties.
A new court date will be set if the parties are unable to arrive at a settlement.
Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited believes that its actions were lawful and that it was entitled to disconnect Caribtels services under its contract with Caribtel.
If the settlement negotiations prove unsuccessful, Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.
Arbitration between Tilts Communications A S Cable and Wireless plc Sonera OY and Republic of Latvia Lattelekom SIA In September 2001, Cable and Wireless plc was joined as a party to an arbitration in connection with its former participation with Sonera OY Sonera in the joint venture Tilts Communications A S Tilts.
Through Tilts, Cable and Wireless plc and Sonera purchased a 49 per cent shareholding in a Latvian telecommunications company, Lattelekom SIA Lattelekom in 1994.
Cable and Wireless plc sold its interest in Tilts to Sonera in June 1998.
Tilts commenced arbitration proceedings in August 2000 against the Republic of Latvia alleging a number of breaches of an agreement signed in 1994 by Tilts, Lattelekom and the Republic of Latvia the Umbrella Agreement.
Tilts claims a total of approximately LVL87.6 million approximately 95 million from the Republic of Latvia as compensation for, amongst other things, losses sustained as a consequence of the shortening of the twenty year exclusivity period granted to Lattelekom as the provider of xed line telecommunications services.
The Republic of Latvia has asserted nine counterclaims for a total of approximately LVL599.5 million approximately 656 million against Tilts, alleging that Tilts has failed to comply with various obligations it assumed under the Umbrella Agreement including i to digitalise and otherwise improve Lattelekoms network in accordance with its contractual commitments, ii to meet certain quality of service and network performance commitments, and iii to procure that Sonera sell its shares in GSM operator Latvijas Mobilais Telefons to Lattelekom.
Tilts considers that the counterclaims asserted by the Republic of Latvia are unfounded.
Cable and Wireless plc was joined as a party to the arbitration by the Republic of Latvia because it and Sonera guaranteed the performance by Tilts of its obligations under the Umbrella Agreement to the Republic of Latvia by performance and parental guarantees.
However, as part of the arrangements relating to Soneras purchase of Cable and Wireless plcs shares in Tilts, Sonera provided Cable and Wireless plc with an indemnity for any liability incurred by Cable and Wireless plc under these guarantees.
Provided Sonera honours its obligations under the indemnity, Cable and Wireless plc will not be exposed to any liability under these guarantees.
Cable and Wireless plc has taken legal advice.
Based on this advice, Cable and Wireless plc believes that the indemnity is binding.
In addition, Sonera provided Cable and Wireless plc with a letter dated 11 December 2001, conrming that in its view all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by Cable and Wireless plc in connection with the arbitration fell within the scope of the indemnity.
Following the acquisition of Sonera in 2002, the successor entity to Sonera, TeliaSonera, provided Cable and Wireless plc with a further letter dated 23 February 2003, acknowledging Soneras obligations under the indemnity and stating that TeliaSoneras acquisition of Sonera did not alter the validity of the conrmations given by Sonera in its earlier letter of 11 December 2001.
Other than the above, there are no pending legal or regulatory proceeding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which the Company believes will if determined adversely to the Group have a material adverse effect on the Groups liquidity or results of operation.

The following is a summary of the significant differences applicable to the Group, and the adjustments necessary to present net income and shareholders equity in accordance with US GAAP are shown on pages 142 and 143.
UK GAAP US GAAP Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 was For acquisitions completed prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill eliminated directly against reserves.

If there is a requirement for future service, the company should accrue the liability over the future service period.
Employees are required to render future service if they must render service until they are terminated and the service period extends beyond a minimum retention period, limited to 60 days unless a contract or law mandates otherwise.

liabilities for remaining lease rentals are not recognised until the property is physically vacated.
If a property has been vacated, but the contract has not been terminated, a liability for the fair value of the future costs may be recognised but must be reduced by the estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained, even if the company has no intention of entering into a sublease.
Onerous contracts If an entity has a contract that is onerous, the present The costs of an onerous contract will be recognised as they obligation under the contract should be recognised and are incurred.

Adjustments to plan benets affecting current participants unrecognised prior service costs are also generally recognised over the average remaining service life of company employees.
When the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the excess must be recognised as an additional liability with an offsetting intangible asset.
However, any intangible asset recognised cannot exceed the amount of unrecognised prior service cost and the excess of the additional liability above the intangible asset is charged to other comprehensive income.

Cash ows The cash ow statement is prepared in accordance with the UK Financial Reporting Standard No 1 Revised, Cash ow statements FRS 1 Revised for UK GAAP reporting.
Its objective and principles are similar to those set out in SFAS 95 Statement of cash ows.
The principal difference between the standards is in respect of classication.
Under FRS 1 Revised, the Group presents its cash ows for: operating activities: returns on investments and servicing of finance: taxation: capital expenditure and financial investment: acquisitions and disposals: equity dividends paid: management of liquid resources: and nancing.

Other US Accounting Standards issued but not adopted In June 2001, the FASB issued FASB Statement No.
143, Accounting for asset retirement obligations.
The standard is effective for scal years beginning after 15 June 2002, with earlier application encouraged.
This standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred.
When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalises a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalised cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.
Management has not determined the effect of the adoption of FASB Statement No.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
148, Accounting of stock-based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No.
This statement amends SFAS No.
123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method on accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
148 requires prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
As Cable & Wireless continues to apply the provisions of APB No.
25 Accounting for stock issued to employees, the adoption of SFAS No.
148 will not impact reported net income or shareholders equity.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
149, Amendment of Statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
SFAS 149 amends and claries accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133.
SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modied after 30 June 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after 30 June 2003.
Management has not determined the effect of the adoption of SFAS 149.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
150, Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFAS 150 improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity.
SFAS 150 requires these instruments to be classied as liabilities in the balance sheet.
SFAS 150 is effective from 15 June 2003.
SFAS 150 is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements.
