The particular accounting policies adopted by the Directors, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, are described below.
a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
c Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, fair values are attributed to the Groups share of net separable assets.
Where the cost of the acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to such net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill and capitalised in the balance sheet in the year of acquisition.
Prior to the implementation of FRS 10 in the year ended 31 December 1998, purchased goodwill was written-off directly to reserves and has not been reinstated.
The profit or loss on the disposal of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill relating to that business not previously charged through the profit and loss account.
The results and cash ows relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated cash ow statement from the date of acquisition up to the date of disposal.
d Intangible assets goodwill For the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, purchased goodwill is capitalised in the year in which it arises and amortised over its estimated useful economic life up to a maximum of 20 years.
The Directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful economic life of goodwill since it is difficult to make projections exceeding this period.
Provision is made for any impairment.
The asset is deemed to be impaired to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The impairment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Capitalised purchased goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible assets.
Capitalised purchased goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill which arose on the acquisition of a business, prior to the implementation of FRS 10 which was written-off to the profit and loss reserve as a matter of accounting policy, remains eliminated in that reserve and will be charged or credited in the profit and loss account as appropriate on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
e Intangible assets intellectual property Intellectual property, including trademarks, for products with an immediate dened revenue stream and acquired for valuable consideration, is capitalised and amortised in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful life of the product generally not exceeding 20 years.
Intellectual property with no dened revenue stream is written-off on acquisition.
f Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
All other tangible xed assets are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write-off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 25 % per annum Ofce furniture and ttings 1025 % per annum Equipment and other 1025 % per annum g Investments Except as stated below, investments held as xed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
In the consolidated accounts, shares in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of pre-tax profits and attributable taxation of the joint ventures based on audited financial statements for the financial year.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the investment in joint ventures is shown as the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures.
In the Company balance sheet, for investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, advantage has not been taken of this relief and the share premium of the shares issued has been included in the cost.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
5766 shire SFS artwork 11. qxd 22 6 04 4:10 pm Page 35 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts 35 for the year ended 31 December 2003 h Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition is based on purchase costs calculated on a first-in, first-out basis, including transport.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
i Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
j Turnover The Group recognises turnover when: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered, the sellers price to the buyer is xed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenues are stated net of VAT and similar taxes, trade discounts and intra-Group transactions.
The principal components of the Groups turnover and their respective accounting treatments are set out below.
Revenue from the sales of products is recognised upon shipment to customers or at the time of delivery depending on the terms of sale.
Provisions for certain rebates, product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as reductions to net turnover in the same period as the related sales are recorded.
Licensing and development fees represent revenues derived from licence agreements and from collaborative research and development arrangements.
Initial licence fees are not considered to be separable from the associated research and development activities, even where such fees are non-refundable and not creditable against research and development services to be rendered.
Initial licence fees are deferred and recognised over the period of the licence term or the period of the associated research and development agreement.
In circumstances where initial licence fees are not for a dened period, revenues are deferred and recognised over the period to the expiration of the relevant patent to which the licence relates.
During the term of certain research and development agreements, the Group receives non-refundable milestones as certain technical targets are achieved.
Revenue is recognised on achievement of milestones.
The Group also receives non-refundable clinical milestones when certain targets are achieved during the clinical phases of development, such as the submission of clinical data to a regulatory authority.
These clinical milestones are recognised when receivable.
If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognised when earned.
No revenue is recognised for consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent on future events, future performance, or refund obligations.
k Research and development Research and development expenditure includes funded and unfunded expenditure and is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
l Pensions The Group contributes to personal dened contribution pension plans of employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
5766 shire SFS artwork 11. qxd 22 6 04 4:10 pm Page 36 36 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 m Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Groups investments in such operations, are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
n Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.
o Finance costs Finance costs of debt are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
p Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Convertible debt is treated as a liability as long as there is no genuine commercial possibility that the option to issue ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares will be exercised.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
q Government grants Government grants in respect of funded research and development expenditure are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
r Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Group's operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of xed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reected in the Group's accounts.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a xed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
s Employee share schemes In accordance with UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes, the cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares is recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account.
The amount recognised, which is the difference between the market value at date of grant and the underlying share and any exercise price, is charged to the profit and loss account over the period the shares are vested, with a corresponding credit to reserves.
t Related party transactions In accordance with the exemptions in FRS 8 related party disclosures, transactions between Group companies have not been disclosed since Group accounts are prepared and include the results of all subsidiary undertakings.
u significant accounting estimates Sales deductions primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid and other Government agencies, contractual rebates with healthmaintenance organizations HMOs, product returns, trade discounts and allowances for the coupon sampling program.
Statutory rebates to state Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with HMOs are based on price differentials between a base price and the selling price.
As a result, the rebates increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product.
Provision for rebates are recorded as reductions to turnover in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends.

The utilisation of operating loss carryforwards is restricted to the taxable income of the subsidiary generating the losses.
As at 31 December 2003, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, management believes it is more likely than not that the Group will realise the benets of the provided deferred tax assets.
However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realisable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.
Company The Company has an unprovided deferred tax asset of 10.3 million 2002: nil carried forward.
The amount shown above is the gross asset represented by non-current marketable securities.
A related liability of approximately 5.0 million is included within notes 20 and 21.

The notes bear interest of 2% per annum, paid semi-annually in arrears.
The convertible notes are guaranteed by Shire and are convertible into redeemable preference shares of the Issuer which upon issuance will be immediately exchanged for either i Shire ordinary shares or ii Shire ADSs, or iii at the Issuers option, a cash amount based upon the London Stock Exchange volume-weighted average prices of ordinary shares from the fourth to the eighth business days following conversion.
At the choice of investors, each $1000 of nominal value notes can be converted into 49.62 Shire ordinary shares subject to adjustment or 16.54 Shire ADSs subject to adjustment at any time up to 21 August 2011.
Alternatively, investors can choose to receive repayment of the nominal principal in cash either at the maturity date of 21 August 2011 or by exercising a put option on any of the three put dates being 21 August 2004, 21 August 2006 and 21 August 2008.
At the option of the Company, repayment can be made in the form of Shire ordinary shares or ADSs.
The number of ordinary shares that a note holder would receive would be based on the notional principal of the notes divided by 95% of the London Stock Exchange volume-weighted average price of ordinary shares on the five trading days after the Company gives notice of the exercise of its option.
Such notice will be on or before the tenth business day preceding the repayment put date.
On or after 21 August 2004, the Company may redeem, for cash, all or part of the notes provided the ordinary share price has exceeded $26.20 Sterling equivalent at the time for 20 of the 30 consecutive dealing days in the period prior to redemption.
During the second quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased 17.6 million $29.8 million of the $400 million 2% guaranteed convertible notes due 2011.
The decision as to whether a note holder would exercise a put option will depend on a number of factors particularly the price of Shire shares at the put date and the likelihood of Shires share price exceeding the conversion threshold price.
The conversion threshold price is 12.52 for ordinary shares.
If the price of Shire ordinary shares at the first put date of 21 August 2004 remains at a level similar to the year end price of 5.425, it is quite possible that note holders will choose to exercise their put options.
The Group currently has adequate resources from which it could satisfy repayment of the entire convertible debt principal of $370.2 million.
ii Canadian federal and provincial government loan The Group has a Canadian federal and provincial government loan outstanding of 0.8 million CAN$2.0 million.
This facility is non-interest bearing and is repayable in annual instalments of 0.4 million CAN$1.0 million in October of 2004 and 2005.

Issue of ordinary shares During the year ended 31 December 2003 the Company allotted 103,653 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 5,182 on the exchange of special ordinary voting shares exchangeable shares, which were issued following the acquisition of BioChem in 2001.
These shares were issued at a premium of 1,121,525.
Repurchase of ordinary shares During the year the Company repurchased a total of 7,592,778 ordinary shares for a total consideration of 31,627,815 representing an average price per share of 416.55p.
All of these shares were cancelled.
Any decision by the Company to acquire further ordinary shares in future will be dependent upon the level of its distributable profits, its financial condition, the terms of any then existing debt facilities, the renewal after 16 June 2004 of the authority given by shareholders and other relevant factors existing at that time.
Issue of special ordinary voting shares The Company exchanged 34,551 special ordinary voting shares during the year ended 31 December 2003.
Each of these shares is equivalent to 3 ordinary shares and is exchangeable into ordinary shares or ADSs, at a rate of one exchangeable share for three ordinary shares or one exchangeable share for one ADS, at any time at the request of the holder.
Only BioChem shareholders with Canadian residency had the option to receive exchangeable shares for their shares of BioChem at the time of acquisition.
The exchangeable shares were issued by Shire Acquisition Inc. a company incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Holders of the exchangeable shares are entitled to dividend and other rights that are economically equivalent to those of ordinary shares.
Through a voting trust and by means of special voting shares in Shire held by the trustee, holders of exchangeable shares are entitled to vote at shareholder meetings of the Company.
As at 31 December 2003 5,839,559 exchangeable shares remained unconverted.
The Company can redeem all outstanding exchangeable shares for ordinary shares after 11 May 2011, or earlier if the total number of exchangeable shares falls below 1 million.
The exchangeable shares are included as part of share capital in the consolidated balance sheet to present a true and fair view of the consolidated Groups capital structure, which differs from the Companies Act 1985 requirements to reect these amounts as minority interests, as they will become, and are equivalent, to ordinary shares.

If the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three years, they are thereafter tested quarterly by reference to share price growth over the extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of the options will become exercisable.
ii Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme vest six weeks prior to the expiry date.
Options granted under this scheme are subject to performance criteria.
In respect of any option granted prior to August 2002, if Shires share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, the option will be exercisable in full.
If it increases by at least 14.5% per annum over the same three-year measurement period, the option may be exercised on 60% of the shares covered by the option.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three-year measurement period, they will thereafter be tested quarterly by reference to compound annual share price growth over an extended period.
The performance criteria were reviewed in 2002 to ensure the criteria reected the market in which Shire operates.
Given Shires development it was considered appropriate that an EPS based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
Therefore, the performance criteria was amended so that an option would only become exercisable in full if Shires EPS growth over a three year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Price Index RPI on average a year for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 3% Directors, RPI plus 5% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 5% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 7% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 9% The new EPS performance criteria apply to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with some of its institutional shareholders, the Company has decided that for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the performance condition should be retested once only, at five years after the grant.
The retest will be applied only where Shires EPS growth has fallen short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant.
Hence the level of EPS growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.
The EPS used will be the fully diluted EPS calculated under US GAAP reporting.
iii These options have been granted over shares in Shire Laboratories Inc. SLI, formerly Pharmavene Inc. a US company acquired by the Group on 23 March 1997.
Exercise of these options results in the option holder receiving ordinary shares in the Company.
As a result of the acquisition of SLI, and in accordance with the terms of the original SLI Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to performance criteria.
iv These options have been granted over shares in Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, a US company acquired by the Group on 23 December 1999.
As a result of the acquisition of Roberts, and in accordance with the terms of the original Roberts Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to any performance criteria.
v Following the acquisition of BioChem on 11 May 2001, the BioChem Plan was amended such that options over BioChems common stock became options over ordinary shares of the Company.
All BioChem options, which were not already exercisable, vested and became exercisable as a result of the acquisition and were not subject to any performance conditions.
vi Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
The exercise of options under this Scheme is not subject to any performance criteria.
vii Under the Stock Purchase Plan options are granted with an exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the enrolment date the first day of the offering period or the exercise date the last day of the offering period, whichever is the lower.
The offering period is for 27 months.
The exercise of options under this plan is not subject to any performance condition.

c Letters of credit As at 31 December 2003 the Group had a number of irrevocable standby letters of credit totalling 24.5 million.
d Capital commitments i Interests in companies and partnerships The Group has undertaken to subscribe to interests in companies and partnerships for amounts totalling 25.0 million 2002: 23.9 million.

ii Government of Canada In 2001, the Group signed a ten-year non-cancellable contract with the Government of Canada GOC to assure a state of readiness in the case of an inuenza pandemic worldwide epidemic and to provide inuenza vaccine for all Canadian citizens in such an event hereinafter referred to as the Pandemic contract.
The concept of a state of readiness against an inuenza pandemic requires the development of sufficient infrastructure and capacity in Canada to provide for domestic vaccine needs in the event of an inuenza pandemic.
The Group is committed to provide 32 million doses of single-strain monovalent u vaccine within a production period of 16 weeks.
The Group has therefore begun a process of expanding its production capacity in order to meet this objective within a five-year period ending January 2006.
The Group is committed to approximately 7.8 million CAN$18.0 million of capital expenditure for the purpose of achieving the level of pandemic readiness required in the Pandemic contract.
The GOC has agreed to reimburse the Group 5.8 million CAN$13.5 million.
At the end of the contract, the Group is committed to buy back any unused and unexpired materials and capital assets reimbursed by the GOC at net book value that can be used for production of trivalent vaccine or other products.
As a condition of the Pandemic contract, Shire Biochem, a wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an irrevocable standby letter of credit of 10.6 million CAN$24.5 million.
The standby letter of credit is collateralised by an equivalent amount of cash.
iii Vaccine production facility In addition, under another GOC contract, the Group is required to supply the GOC with a substantial proportion of its annual inuenza vaccine requirements over a ten-year period ending March 2011.
Subject to mutual agreement, the contract can be renewed for a further period of between one and ten years.
The Group is also committed to the expansion of its vaccine production facility located in Quebec City.
A new building will be located alongside the existing vaccine production facility in the Quebec Metro High Tech Park for an estimated 21.0 million CAN$48.8 million.
Construction of this facility commenced in November 2003.
It is expected that this facility will be operational in 2006. iv TPC research facility In March 2000, the Group entered into a funding agreement with TPC, a Canadian governmental agency, hereinafter referred to as the TPC agreement relating to the research and development of recombinant protein vaccines.
The TPC agreement has as its objective the creation in Canada of skilled scientific and technological jobs in the research and development eld, the local manufacture of developed products, capital investment and financial return on investment.
The TPC agreed to a total contribution not to exceed 34.6 million CAN$80.0 million.
Such contribution is repayable to the TPC in the form of royalties on the net sales value gross invoiced amounts less discounts, taxes and delivery costs if the products become commercialised.
The Group is obligated to pay such royalties in the period to 31 December 2016.
No amounts have been accrued with respect to this obligation, as the conditions for repayment have not yet been met.
As a condition of the TPC agreement, the Group has an obligation to build a vaccine research facility in Canada.
The construction of the vaccine research centre in Laval, Canada will represent an investment of approximately 15.4 million CAN$35.6 million and should be completed in December 2004.
The TPC agreement requires the Group to comply with certain conditions as outlined in the agreement.
Any violation of such conditions allows the TPC to declare the Group in default and may result in repayment of all previous funding.
v METHYPATCH In connection with the Groups purchase of METHYPATCH in 2003, the Group has obligation to make certain payments on the achievement of milestones.
This will require up to 27.9 million $50.0 million on registration and a further 41.9 million $75.0 million dependent upon certain sales targets being achieved.

The milestone payments could reach an amount of 1.7 million CAN$4.0 million if no generic events have occurred for those products by 22 January 2007. e Contingent liabilities Shire is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including those set out below.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings referred to below, Shire believes that they will not have a materially adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
i Phentermine Shire US Inc. SUS, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a defendant in 429 lawsuits still pending in both US federal and state courts which seek damages for, among other things, personal injury arising from phentermine products supplied for the treatment of obesity by SUS and several other pharmaceutical companies.
SUS, formerly known as Shire Richwood Inc. has been sued as a manufacturer and distributor of phentermine, an anorectic used in the short-term treatment of obesity and one of the products addressed by the lawsuits.
The suits relate to phentermine either alone or together with fenuramine or dexenuramine.
The lawsuits generally allege the following claims: the defendants marketed phentermine and other products for the treatment of obesity and misled users about the products and dangers associated with them: the defendants failed adequately to test phentermine individually and when taken in combination with the other drugs: and the defendants knew or should have known about the negative effects of the drugs and should have informed the public about such risks and or failed to provide appropriate warning labels.
SUS has been named as a defendant in a total of 4,226 such phentermine lawsuits, in respect of which SUS has been dismissed as a defendant in 3,797 cases.
Shire is awaiting the furtherance of proceedings in the remaining 429 pending lawsuits.
SUS became involved with phentermine through its acquisition of certain assets of Rexar Pharmacal Corporation Rexar in January 1994.
In addition to SUS potentially incurring liability as a result of its own production of Oby-Cap, a phentermine product, the plaintiffs may additionally seek to impose liability on SUS as successor to Rexar.
SUS intends to defend vigorously all the lawsuits.
SUS denies liability on a number of grounds including lack of scientific evidence that phentermine, properly prescribed, causes the alleged side effects and that SUS did not promote phentermine for long-term combined use as part of the fen phen diet.
Accordingly, SUS intends to defend vigorously any and all claims made against the Group in respect of phentermine.
Legal expenses to date have been paid by Eon, the supplier to SUS, or Eons insurance carriers but such insurance is now exhausted.
Eon has agreed to defend and indemnify SUS in this litigation pursuant to an agreement dated 30 November 2000 between Eon and SUS.
"ii ADDERALL XR Shires extended release ""once daily"" version of ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR is covered by US patent No."
In January 2003 the Group was notied that Barr Laboratories, Inc. Barr had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic version of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the Groups 819 Patent.
The notication alleged that the 819 Patent is not infringed by Barr's extended release mixed amphetamine salt product, which is the subject of Barrs ANDA.
On 24 February 2003 Shire Laboratories Inc. Shire Laboratories led suit against Barr in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Barrs ANDA infringes the '819 Patent.
The Group is seeking a ruling that Barrs ANDA infringes the 819 Patent and should not be approved before the expiration date of the 819 Patent.
The Group is also seeking an injunction to prevent Barr from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 819 Patent, damages in the event that Barr should engage in such commercialisation, as well its legal fees and costs.
Barr has counterclaimed for a declaration that its ANDA product will not infringe the claims of the 819 Patent.
Barr is also seeking its legal fees, costs and expenses.
On 12 August 2003 Shire Laboratories was issued a new US patent No.
6,605,300 the 300 Patent covering ADDERALL XR.
In August 2003 Shire was notied that Barr had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic version of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the 300 Patent and alleging that the 300 Patent is invalid.
In September 2003 Shire Laboratories led a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Barr alleging that Barrs ANDA infringes the 300 Patent.
The Group is seeking a ruling that Barrs ANDA infringes the 300 Patent and should not be approved before the expiration date of the 300 Patent.
The Group is also seeking an injunction to prevent Barr from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 300 Patent, damages in the event that Barr should engage in such commercialisation, as well its legal fees and costs.
By way of a counterclaim Barr is seeking a declaration that the 300 Patent is invalid and Barr has also asked for its legal fees, costs and expenses.
The lawsuits against Barr with respect to the 819 and 300 Patents were consolidated in December 2003 and a trial date scheduled for January 2006.
5766 shire SFS artwork 11. qxd 22 6 04 4:10 pm Page 67 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts 67 for the year ended 31 December 2003 26 Guarantees, commitments and contingencies continued Barr may not launch a generic version of ADDERALL XR before it receives final approval of its ANDA from the FDA.
The lawsuits triggered stays of FDA approval of up to 30 months from the Groups receipt of Barrs notices to allow the court to resolve the suits.
Even if Barr receives a tentative approval from the FDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the latest stay February 2006 or a district court decision in its favour.
In the event that the Group does not prevail, then Barr could be in a position to market its extended release mixed amphetamine salt product upon FDA final approval of its ANDA following the expiry of the existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity in October 2004.
In November 2003 Shire was notied that Impax Laboratories Impax had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic version of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration dates of the 819 and 300 Patents and alleging that the 819 and 300 Patents are not infringed by Impaxs extended release mixed amphetamine salt product, the subject of Impaxs ANDA.
In December 2003, Shire Laboratories led suit against Impax for infringement of the 819 and 300 Patents.
The Group is seeking a ruling that Impaxs ANDA infringes the 819 and 300 Patents and should not be approved before the expiration dates of the 819 and 300 Patents.
The Group is also seeking an injunction to prevent Impax from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 819 and 300 Patents, damages in the event that Impax should engage in such commercialisation, as well its legal fees and costs.
Impaxs afrmative defences include noninfringement and invalidity of both the 819 and 300 Patents.
Impax is also requesting that costs be assessed against the Group.
Impax may not launch a generic version of ADDERALL XR before it receives final approval of its ANDA from the FDA.
The lawsuit triggered a stay of FDA approval of up to 30 months from the Groups receipt of Impaxs notice to allow the court to resolve the suit.
Even if Impax receives a tentative approval from the FDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the stay May 2006 or a district court decision in its favour.
In the event that the Group does not prevail, then Impax could be in a position to market its extended release mixed amphetamine salt product upon FDA final approval of its ANDA following the expiry of the existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity in October 2004 and upon expiry of any exclusivity that Barr may hold.
iii CARBATROL In August 2003 the Group was notied that Nostrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Nostrum had submitted an ANDA under the HatchWaxman Act seeking permission to market its generic version of the 300 mg strength of CARBATROL prior to the expiration date of the Groups US patents for CARBATROL, US patent No.
5,912,013 the 013 Patent and US patent No.
The notication alleges that the 013 and 570 Patents are not infringed by Nostrums 300 mg extended release carbamazepine product, the subject of Nostrums ANDA.
This dosage strength represents half of Shires current sales in epilepsy.
On 18 September 2003 Shire Laboratories Inc. served suit against Nostrum in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for infringement of these two patents.
The Group is seeking a ruling that Nostrums ANDA infringes the 013 and 570 Patents and should not be approved before the expiration date of the 013 and 570 Patents.
The Group is also seeking an injunction to prevent Nostrum from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 013 and 570 Patents, damages in the event that Nostrum should engage in such commercialisation, as well its legal fees and costs.
On 23 January 2004 the Group amended the complaint to delete the allegations with respect to the 013 Patent.
By way of counterclaims Nostrum is seeking a declaration that the 570 and 013 Patents are not infringed by Nostrums ANDA product as well as actual and punitive damages for alleged abuse of process by Shire.
Nostrum may not launch a generic version of CARBATROL before it receives final approval of its ANDA from the FDA.
The lawsuit triggered a stay of FDA approval of up to 30 months from Shires receipt of Nostrums notice to allow the court to resolve the suit.
Even if Nostrum receives tentative approval from the FDA for its ANDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the stay February 2006 or a district court decision in its favour.
In the event that the Group does not prevail, then Nostrum could be in a position to market its 300 mg extended release carbamazepine product upon FDA final approval of its ANDA.
iv Other matters In addition, the Group is involved in claims and lawsuits in the normal course of business.
It is not possible at this time to determine the ultimate outcome of any of these claims.
5766 shire SFS artwork 11. qxd 22 6 04 4:10 pm Page 68 68 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 27 Pension arrangements The Group has a number of dened contribution retirement plans that together cover substantially all employees.
The company contribution is xed as a set percentage of employees pay.
The pension cost charge for the dened contribution schemes for the year was 9,824,000 2002: 4,702,000.
The closing creditor in respect of pension premiums at 31 December 2003 is 605,000 31 December 2002: 306,000.
The dened benefit plan operated by the Group was a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP for certain US employees of the acquired company, Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, who met certain age and service requirements.
The plan was discontinued in 2000 and there were no contributions payable in respect of the years 2003 and 2002.
The Group paid a lump sum of 11.3 million $18.0 million into the SERP, which was accounted for as a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation to make good the deficit on this scheme at the time of acquisition.
This lump sum payment has led to the Group having no future liability under the SERP, which has been closed to new members with contributions no longer payable by existing members.
The asset and liability of 6.7 million and 5.0 million respectively are shown in notes 18, 20 and 21 respectively.

Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 53 In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 1 Description of operations Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Shire and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as the Company is a global pharmaceutical company with a strategic focus on meeting the needs of the specialist physician.
The Company has a particular interest in innovative therapies that are prescribed by specialist doctors as opposed to primary care physicians.
The Company is focusing on the development of late stage projects and marketing products in the areas of central nervous system CNS, gastrointestinal GI and renal.
Geographically, the Company has operations in the worlds key pharmaceutical markets, namely North America and Europe.
The Companys corporate head ofce is based in Basingstoke, UK.
The Companys business is organized across five operating segments: US, International covering territories outside of the US, Research & Development R&D, Biologics and Corporate.
Revenues are derived primarily from three sources: sales of products by the Companys own sales and marketing operations, royalties where Shire has out-licensed products to third parties and licensing and development fees.
In May 2001, Shire merged with BioChem Pharma, Inc. BioChem, an international pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Canada.
This brought anti-infective projects to Shire as well as a royalty stream on sales of 3TC and ZEFFIX, out-licensed to GlaxoSmithKline GSK.
In September 2002, Shire acquired APS, subsequently renamed Shire US Manufacturing Inc. SUMI, which includes a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Owings Mills, Maryland.
It is expected that the SUMI facility will become a primary or secondary manufacturer for ADDERALL XR, CARBATROL, PENTASA and DEXTROSTAT in 2004.
This will mitigate Shires supply risk in the US, in line with the Companys policy of dual sourcing key products.
In February 2003, the Company acquired the worldwide sales and marketing rights to METHYPATCH, a methylphenidate transdermal delivery system for the once-daily treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD from Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. Also during 2003, the Company acquired five products for the Canadian market from DRAXIS Health Inc. and certain international rights to VANIQA from Women First Healthcare, Inc.
Following a detailed strategic review conducted in 2003, the Company has revised its strategic priority.
Shire will search, develop and market but will not invent.
The Company will seek to acquire products with substantive patent protection rather than just three years Hatch-Waxman exclusivity.
The Company will also focus its in-licensing and merger and acquisition M&A efforts on the US market, and obtain European rights whenever possible.
Shire has refocused its Research and Development R&D efforts and technology to concentrate on areas where it has a commercial presence and is creating the exibility to add new therapeutic areas based on product acquisition opportunities.
The strategic review thoroughly evaluated the Groups pipeline and refocused resources on four projects, which are currently in Phase II and III of development.
This approach aims to deliver the combined benefit of increased returns and lower risks.
The implementation of these actions has resulted in: the exit from early stage therapeutic research, which was completed in the third quarter of 2003: the planned exit from the vaccines business, which Shire is targeting to achieve around mid-year 2004.
These changes have implications for both the Groups organizational structure and operating sites.
The Company has a new global management structure aimed at close interaction between development, marketing and sales, and new people in key positions reporting directly to the Chief Executive officer.
In addition, the Company has advanced its plans to reduce the number of North American sites from fourteen to four, including the opening of a new US headquarters ofce on the East Coast.
Pennsylvania is currently being considered in this regard.
The Company will close its sites in Newport, Kentucky and Rockville, Maryland.
Shires world headquarters will continue to be located in Basingstoke, UK.
The cost of the planned reorganization in 2004 is estimated at approximately $55 million split between retaining and relocating key staff to the new US headquarters, and site closure costs and other relocation expenses.
The majority of these costs will be charged as part of operating expenses.
It is anticipated that these changes will improve both the efficiency of operation and the cost structure of the Group going forward.
54 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 1 Description of operations continued The Companys principal revenues in the relevant markets include: in the US, ADDERALL XR and ADDERALL for the treatment of ADHD, AGRYLIN for the treatment of elevated blood platelets, PENTASA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, CARBATROL for the treatment of epilepsy and PROAMATINE for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.
In addition, the Company receives royalties on sales of REMINYL for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, marketed by Janssen, and on EPIVIR, COMBIVIR and TRIZIVIR for the treatment of HIV AIDS and EPIVIR-HBV for the treatment of hepatitis B, each marketed by GSK: in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the CALCICHEW range, used primarily as adjuncts in the treatment of osteoporosis, and REMINYL, which is co-promoted by Janssen-Cilag: in Canada, 3TC for the treatment of HIV AIDS, COMBIVIR and HEPTOVIR all marketed in partnership with GSK : AMATINE and FLUVIRAL S F, a vaccine for the prevention of inuenza: and in the Rest of the World, royalties on the sales of ZEFFIX for the treatment of hepatitis B, marketed by GSK, and royalties on sales of REMINYL marketed by Johnson & Johnson.
In addition, the Company has a number of projects in later stage development including: FOSRENOL for the treatment of high blood phosphate levels associated with kidney failure.
The Company submitted the first regulatory submission for FOSRENOL under the European Mutual Recognition procedure on March 13, 2001 and a New Drug Application NDA with the US FDA on April 30, 2002.
The Company received an approvable letter from the US FDA on March 3, 2003: XAGRID in the EU which is the trade name of AGRYLIN in the EU.
On July 25, 2003, the Company received a positive Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products opinion: Adult indication for ADDERALL XR.
The Company received an approvable letter from the US FDA on October 20, 2003: METHYPATCH, a transdermal delivery system for the once daily treatment of ADHD.
Shire and Noven are working closely to supply the FDA with appropriate Phase III data requested in their non-approvable letter issued on April 28, 2003: BIPOTROL SPD417 for bipolar disorder.
In February 2004 Shire led an NDA for this indication: SPD503 guanfacine for ADHD, in Phase III: and SPD476 for ulcerative colitis in Phase II.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Shire and all of its subsidiary undertakings after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
b Use of estimates in consolidated financial statements The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to provisions for product returns, valuation of intangible assets, contingent liabilities and sales deductions.
c Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when: there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement: delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered: the sellers price to the buyer is xed or determinable: and collectability is reasonably assured.
The Companys principal revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below: i Product sales Revenue for the sales of products is recognized upon shipment to customers or at the time of delivery i. e. FOB destination depending on the terms of sale.
Provisions for rebates, product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded.
The Company monitors and tracks the amount of rebates, product returns and discounts to customers based on historical experience to estimate the amount of reduction to revenue.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 55 In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued ii Licensing and development fees Licensing and development fees represent revenues derived from product out-licensing agreements and from contract research and development agreements.
Initial license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements, even where such fees are non-refundable and not creditable against future royalty payments, are deferred and recognized over the period of the license term, or the period of the associated collaborative assistance.
In circumstances where initial license fees are not for a dened period, revenues are deferred and recognized over the period to the expiration of the relevant patent to which the license relates.
During the term of certain research and development agreements and licensing agreements, the Company receives non-refundable milestones as certain technical targets are achieved.
Revenues are recognized on achievement of milestones.
The Company also receives non-refundable clinical milestones when certain targets are achieved during the clinical phases of development, such as the submission of clinical data to a regulatory authority.
These clinical milestones are recognized when received.
Revenue from contract research and development agreements is recognized as the services are performed.
iii Royalty income Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognized when the licensee sells the underlying product.
The Company receives sales information from the licensee on a monthly basis.
For any period that the information is not available, the Company estimates sales amounts based on the historical product information.
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added tax and similar taxes, and trade discounts.
No revenue is recognized for consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent on future events, future performance, or refund obligations.
d Research and development Research and development expenditures include funded and unfunded expenditures and are charged to operations in the period in which the expense is incurred.
e Leased assets The costs of operating leases are charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are not made on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the balance sheet as tangible xed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease payments are recorded as liabilities, while the interest element is charged to operations over the period of the lease to produce a level yield on the balance of the capital lease obligation.
f Finance costs of debt Finance costs of debt are recorded as a deferred asset and then amortized to the statement of operations over the term of the debt, using the effective interest rate method.
Deferred nancing costs relating to debt extinguishments are written off and reected in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
g Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS No.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Income tax expense is computed as the tax payable or refundable for the period, plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
h Earnings per share Earnings per share EPS is computed in accordance with SFAS No.
128, Earnings per Share SFAS No.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing consolidated net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing consolidated net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares that might be issued upon exercise of ordinary stock options.
Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to increase earnings per share or reduce a loss per share.
56 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued i Advertising expense The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred.
Advertising costs amounted to $40.7 million, $45.6 million and $21.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.
j Foreign currency Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Transaction gains and losses are recognized in arriving at operating net income.
The results of overseas operations, whose functional currency is not US dollars, are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The cumulative effect of exchange rate movements is included in a separate component of other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses on an after-tax basis included in consolidated net income in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, pursuant to SFAS No.
52, Foreign Currency Translation, amounted to a $6.7 million loss, $0.3 million loss and $0.5 million loss, respectively.
k Employee stock plans The Company accounts for its stock options using the intrinsic-value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No.
Accordingly, compensation cost of stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Shires stock at the measurement date over the option exercise price and is charged to operations over the vesting period.
For plans where the measurement date occurs after the grant date, referred to as variable plans, compensation cost is re-measured on the basis of the current market value of Shire stock at the end of each reporting period.
Shire recognizes compensation expense for variable plans with performance conditions if achievement of those conditions becomes probable.
123, Accounting for Stock Based on Compensation SFAS No.
123, the Company has included in these financial statements the required pro forma disclosures as if the fair-value method of accounting had been applied.

Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 57 In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued n Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of nished goods, are stated at the lower of cost including manufacturing overheads, where appropriate or net realizable value.
Net realizable value is based on estimated normal selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
o Investments The Company has certain investments in equity securities.
Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives the Company the ability to exercise significant inuence, but not control over, the investee.
significant inuence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investees Board of Directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate.
Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its investments in equity-method investees in the consolidated balance sheet as Investments Equity method investments and its share of the investees earnings or losses together with other-than temporary impairments in value as Equity in losses earnings of equity method investees in the consolidated statement of operations.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant inuence, are accounted for under the cost method or at fair value.
Investments in private companies are carried at cost, less provisions for other than temporary impairment in value.
For public companies that have readily determinable fair values, the Company classies its equity investments as available-for-sale and, accordingly, records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, net of any related tax effect.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense, net see note 23.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specic identication method.
Interest and dividends on securities classied as available-for-sale are included as interest income.
p Goodwill and other intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Periods ending on or before December 31, 2001 For periods ending on or before December 31, 2001, goodwill recognized in respect of each significant business combination was amortized over a period of 5 to 30 years weighted average: 19 years on a straight line basis depending on the nature of the goodwill, and was evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicated, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Impairments of goodwill were recognized if expected undiscounted cash ows were not sufficient to recover the goodwill.
If a material impairment was identied, goodwill was written down to its estimated fair value.
Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected net cash ows to be generated by the business, discounted using a rate commensurate with the risks involved.
Periods commencing January 1, 2002 Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No.
142, which applies to all goodwill and other intangible assets, recognized in the balance sheets at that date, regardless of when the assets were initially recognized.
This statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives no longer be amortized to operations, but instead be reviewed for impairment, at least annually.
The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
The Company annually examines the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether there are any impairment losses and has determined that for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, there are no such losses.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, which comprise intellectual property including trade marks for products with a dened revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval, are recorded at cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the related product, which ranges from 5 to 40 years weighted average 23 years.
Intellectual property with no dened revenue stream, where the related product has not yet completed the necessary approval process, is written off to operations on acquisition.
58 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued The following factors are considered in estimating useful lives.
Where an intangible asset is a composite of a number of factors, the period of amortization is determined from considering these factors together: expected use of the asset: regulatory, legal or contractual provisions, including the regulatory approval and review process, patent issues and actions by government agencies: the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing products and other economic factors, including the stability of the market, known technological advances, development of competing drugs that are more effective clinically or economically: and actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies or others that may eliminate current competitive advantages.
q Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Cost of significant assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction period.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to writeoff the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 20 to 50 years Ofce furniture, ttings and equipment 4 to 10 years Warehouse, laboratory and manufacturing equipment 4 to 10 years The cost of land is not depreciated.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
The costs of major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
At the time property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts.
The profit or loss on such disposition is reected in operating income.
r Valuation and impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and investments The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets other than goodwill and investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
When such a determination is made, managements estimate of undiscounted cash ows to be generated by the assets is compared to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether an impairment has occurred.
If an impairment is indicated, the amount of the impairment recognized in the consolidated financial statements is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
This fair value is usually estimated based on estimated discounted cash ows.
s Assets held for sale An asset is classied as held for sale when, amongst other things, the Company has committed to a plan of disposition, the asset is available for immediate sale, and the plan is not expected to change signicantly.
t Rebates Rebates primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with health-maintenance organizations HMOs.
Provision for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends.
u Common stock The authorized common stock of the Company as of December 31, 2003 was 799,999,965 ordinary shares and 17,500,000 special ordinary voting shares.
The special ordinary voting shares are entitled to dividend and other rights that are economically equivalent to those of the ordinary shares.
During the second quarter of 2003, the Company initiated a planned re purchase of its common stock.
During that period, the Company repurchased 7,592,778 of its ordinary shares at an average price of $6.78 per share.
v Concentration of risk Revenues are mainly derived from agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and relationships with pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy chains.
significant customers are disclosed in note 21.
Such clients have significant cash resources and therefore any credit risk associated with these transactions is considered minimal.
Excess cash is invested in bank and building society term deposits and commercial paper from a variety of companies with strong credit ratings.
These investments typically bear minimal credit risk.
A significant proportion of revenue is derived from ADDERALL XR and 3TC.
During 2003, revenues from these products were $474.5 million and $144.6 million respectively, representing 38% and 12% of total revenues respectively.
As a result, factors affecting the sale or production of ADDERALL XR or 3TC would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operation.

x New accounting pronouncements i Adopted in the current year In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
145, Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.
13 and Technical Corrections SFAS No 145.
The principal change reected in this pronouncement is that gains or losses from extinguishment of debt which were classied as extraordinary items by SFAS No.
4 are no longer classied as such.
The Company adopted SFAS No.
When adopted, prior extraordinary items relating to the extinguishment of debt were reclassied.
This resulted in extraordinary items of $2.6 million $4.1 million before taxes and $1.5 million of income taxes in 2001 being reclassied to interest expense and income taxes, respectively.
ii To be adopted in future periods In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No.
46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No.
FIN 46R claries the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51 Consolidated Financial Statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.
FIN 46R requires the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities, by the primary beneciary of the entity.
The primary beneciary is the entity, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses or receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both.
Among other changes, FIN 46R a claried some requirements of the original FIN 46 which had been issued in January 2003, b eased some implementation problems and c added new exceptions.
FIN 46R deferred the effective date of the Interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period after March 15, 2004 except that all public companies must, at a minimum, apply the provisions of the Interpretation to all entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under the FASB literature prior to the issuance of FIN 46R by the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003.
The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on its financial position, cash ows or results of operations.
y Statutory accounts The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the UK Companies Act 1985.
Statutory accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales.
The auditors report on those accounts was unqualied.
3 Business combinations and reorganizations Year ended December 31, 2003 a Closure of Lead Optimization On July 31, 2003, Shire announced its decision to close Lead Optimization as a result of a strategic review.
The closure resulted in: the severance of approximately 135 Lead Optimization employees.
As of December 2003, 130 had left the Company, and the remaining employees left by January 31, 2004.
Severance payments are being made to the former employees over a fifteen-month period, as required by local regulations: a $6.0 million write-off of associated tangible xed assets.
These assets, primarily laboratory equipment, were used by Lead Optimization for research and development and have no alternative use: and the cancellation, to the extent possible, of contracts directly relating to Lead Optimization.

As a result of this initial process, the Company decided to dispose of its building in Laval, Canada and will relocate the employees based in Laval to another site or enter into a lease agreement with an ultimate buyer.
The Company also decided to sell its building in Buffalo Grove.
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had obtained valuations of the properties and entered into sale negotiations with third parties on the Laval property and is actively seeking buyers for its Buffalo Grove facility.
Based on these negotiations, the valuations obtained, the limitations on use of the building in its current state and the overall real estate market, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of $10.7 million, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations: in addition, the Company has reclassied to prepaid expenses and other current assets the assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.
Year ended December 31, 2002 a SUMI acquisition On September 27, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of SUMI from Niro Inc. for cash consideration of $17.3 million, including $0.3 million costs of acquisition.
This transaction provided the Company with an in-house facility in which to manufacture several key US products.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method and goodwill of $10.2 million was recorded.
The results of operations of SUMI have been included in the consolidated results of the Company since the date of acquisition.

b Divestment of OTC products division On December 27, 2002, the Company completed its divestment of a group of non-strategic US products, known collectively as the Over-The-Counter OTC products.
The Company received sale proceeds of $71.0 million and recorded a gain on disposal of $2.1 million.
Further details of this discontinued operation are provided in note 4 below.
4 Discontinued operations In December 1999 the Company acquired a group of products, collectively referred to as the OTC portfolio, through its merger with Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation Roberts.
The OTC portfolio consisted of non-prescription laxatives and dietary supplements sold by the Companys US operating segment.
As a pharmaceuticals company that focuses on prescription only products, this part of the business was not considered to be a core part of the Companys long-term strategy and hence the decision was made to divest the OTC portfolio.
On December 27, 2002, the Company completed its divestment of the OTC business.
The historical consolidated financial statements have been restated to reect the OTC business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarized below.
The amounts include income tax provisions based on the stand alone results of the OTC business.
There have been no allocations of general and administrative corporate costs or interest expense related to corporate credit facilities to the discontinued operation.
As the OTC business functioned within Shire US, which itself essentially functions as an independent entity, no corporate costs were eliminated upon discontinuance of the operation.
Within Shire US, the OTC business had few dedicated resources.
All of the products were manufactured and packaged by third party contract manufacturers.
The products were distributed through a shared warehouse facility and sold through a small sales team.

Throughout the year the Company continuously assesses the carrying value of its other intangible assets.
This involves consideration of, among other things, the direction of the business and the marketability of the underlying products.
The Company recorded asset impairments of $12.1 million 2002: $18.8 million and wrote down $15.4 million 2002: $nil of assets during the year ended December 31, 2003.
The asset impairments of $12.1 million resulted from a decline in product prices, which decreased the estimated future cash ows and the $15.4 million resulted from a decision not to renew product licenses that were not core to the business.
The impairments and write-downs totalling $27.5 million have been reected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations $11.7 million 2002: $10.8 million in the US segment and $15.8 million 2002: $8.0 million in the International segment.
During 2002 the Company reviewed its existing product base.
On completion of this review, management decided to cease supporting certain products that were not considered to be core to the business and to redirect investment toward other more profitable products.
Intangible assets associated with these products, namely product rights and licenses, were written down to their fair value based on discounted cash ow analyses.
This resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss of $18.8 million $10.8 million in the US segment and $8.0 million in the international segment, which has been reected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
Amortization charged for the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $26.4 million, $23.5 million and $31.4 million, respectively.
Goodwill was no longer amortized with effect from January 1, 2002 following the adoption of SFAS No.
66 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets, net continued Adoption of SFAS No.
142 As described in note 2, the Company adopted SFAS No.
A transitional assessment of goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2002 was completed by June 30, 2002.
Management concluded that the fair value of the Companys individual reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the net assets including goodwill, and hence this process did not result in any impairment being recorded on adoption of SFAS No.
A reconciliation table is provided below to exclude the effect of goodwill amortization in accordance with the transitional disclosures relating to SFAS No.

The convertible notes are guaranteed by Shire and are convertible into redeemable preference shares of the Issuer which upon issuance will be immediately exchanged for either i Shire ordinary shares, ii Shire ADSs or iii at the Issuers option, a cash amount based upon the London Stock Exchange volume-weighted average prices of ordinary shares on the fourth through eighth business days following conversion.
At the choice of investors, each $1,000 of nominal value notes can be converted into 49.62 Shire ordinary shares subject to adjustment or 16.54 Shire ADSs subject to adjustment at any time up to August 21, 2011.
Alternatively, investors can choose to receive repayment of the nominal principal in cash either at the maturity date of August 21, 2011 or by exercising a put option on any of the three put dates being August 21, 2004, August 21, 2006 and August 21, 2008.
On or after August 21, 2004, the Company may redeem, for cash, all or part of the notes providing the ordinary share price has exceeded $26.20 British pound equivalent at the time for 20 of the 30 consecutive dealing days in the period prior to redemption.
The decision as to whether a note holder should exercise a put option will depend on a number of factors, particularly the price of Shire shares at the put date and the likelihood of the Companys share price exceeding the conversion threshold price.
The conversion threshold price is equivalent to $20.15 or 12.52 at the closing exchange rate for 2003 for Shire ordinary shares and $60.46 for Shire ADSs.
If the price of Shire ordinary shares at the first put date of August 21, 2004 remains at a level similar to the 2003 year-end price of 5.42 $29.06 for Shire ADSs, it is quite possible that note holders will choose to exercise their put options.
The Company currently has adequate resources from which it could satisfy repayment of the entire convertible debt principal of $370.2 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company repurchased $29.8 million of the convertible notes due 2011, recording a gain of $0.5 million which is reected in other expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations.
The interest expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2003 was $7.5 million 2002: $8.0 million, 2001: $2.9 million.

Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts.
The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the Companys intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of financial instrument: Marketable securities commercial paper and institutional and managed cash funds the carrying value approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
Investments the carrying value of non-current investments with readily determinable market values equals the fair value as such instruments are marked to market.
Long-term debt the fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the discounted future cash ows using currently available interest rates or, where the debt instrument is traded, by reference to the market price.
The carrying amounts and corresponding fair values of financial instruments, were as follows as of December 31, 2003 and 2002: Carrying Amount Fair Value $000 $000 December 31, 2003 Financial assets: Commercial paper 120,872 120,872 Institutional and managed cash funds 183,257 183,257 Investments 22,057 22,057 Financial liabilities: Long-term debt 376,781 378,769 December 31, 2002 Financial assets: Commercial paper 87,843 87,843 Institutional and managed cash funds 228,283 228,283 Investments 14,129 14,129 Financial liabilities: Long-term debt 408,190 376,883 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

5, Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.
5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss.
Where the estimated loss lies within in a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount is recorded.
In other cases management's best estimate of the loss is recorded.
These estimates are developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are rened each accounting period in light of additional information being known.
In instances where the Company is unable to develop a best estimate of loss, no litigation loss is recorded at that time.
As information becomes known a loss provision is set up when a best estimate can be made.
The best estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised.
Any outcome upon settlement that deviates from the Companys best estimate may result in an additional expense in a future accounting period.

This plan resulted in the decision to terminate 57 employees and to dispose of Shires existing manufacturing facility.
All of the planned terminations were completed by December 31, 2001, at a cost of $8.8 million.
The Company paid $8.0 million of this during the year ended December 31, 2001 and the remaining $0.8 million over the following year.
ii Asset impairments Asset impairments consist of the write-off of approximately $6.3 million of patents, $6.8 million of licenses and $7.8 million of distribution rights, which were held by BioChem at the time of the merger.
Upon consummation of the BioChem merger, the Company reviewed the carrying value of all intangible assets of the combined organization in an attempt to identify any intangible assets that were duplicative, inconsistent with the strategic direction of the Company, or where management did not perceive any ongoing value that would be derived from these assets.
This review resulted in the write-off of certain patents and licenses that were related to products and know-how that would not be utilized by the combined organization and that had no residual sales value.
In addition, it resulted in the write-off of distribution rights related to a specic product for which BioChem management was pursuing sales in the United States.
The combined organization did not intend to sell this product in the United States: additionally, the distribution rights had no residual sales value.
iii Merger transaction expenses The merger transaction expenses represent direct costs incurred by the Company in connection with the merger with BioChem.
These costs include bank and other advisory fees, taxes associated with the transaction and other direct incremental costs associated with the merger.
iv Loss on disposition of facility As described above, the Company made the decision to close its existing manufacturing facility in Toronto and to dispose of the facility.
The Company incurred a loss of $8.1 million upon the disposition.

In addition, the Company recorded an impairment of $4.5 million due to a decrease in the market value of its investment in private companies.
The assessment of market value was based on the projected value of an anticipated share offering in early 2004 by the Company at a value less than the current price per share recorded by the Company.
The impairments were recorded in the International segment.
December 31, 2002 The Company recorded an impairment of $5.5 million against its investments in the GeneChem funds during 2002 due to an other than temporary impairment in the investment portfolio.
In addition, the Company recorded an impairment of $3.2 million due to a decrease in the market value of its investment in private companies, based on changes in estimates in value from the prior year.
December 31, 2001 Following the merger with BioChem in 2001, management of the combined organization determined that it should review the carrying value of all cost method investments held by the combined organization, considering, amongst other things, a the combined organizations strategic direction and re-prioritization of investments, b the Companys knowledge of certain developments in 2001 with regards to the US Food and Drug Administrations approval process of certain products, and c a strategic re-evaluation of the risks that the combined organization was willing to retain, relating to certain ventures and guarantees.
As a result of this review, the Company determined that it was necessary to record impairment charges totaling $55.7 million related to certain of these investments.
The impairment consisted of the write-off of an investment in Qualia, of $18.7 million, the write-off of the investment in a Biovector of $6.2 million and a write-down of the net assets of Immunosystems by $30.8 million.
a Qualia BioChem held a 14.1% equity interest in common stock and an investment in preferred shares of Qualia, which, at the time of the merger, owned, amongst other development projects, the rights to a product that was approved for sale in Europe and Canada.
This product was in development for a planned submission to the FDA for approval to sell in the United States.
The Company reviewed the status of the product and the estimated timing of submission to the FDA, its estimate of the future cash ows from royalties which would be received upon sale of the product without such registration and Qualias access to additional funding.
Based on the assessment of these factors, the Company determined that the investment should be written off as 1 approval by the FDA, originally expected in June 2001, had not occurred, creating doubt relative to the timing of an eventual approval of the product by the FDA, 2 Shire management believed that without registration with the FDA the projected royalties generated from the sale of this product could not generate cash ows sufficient to recover the investment and 3 Shire anticipated the efforts necessary to obtain approval from the FDA as significant.
BioChem management assessed the carrying value of the Qualia investment at the end of 2000.
Based on the projected operating results at that time, the initial sales of the product in Canada and Europe, and, most importantly, their expectation of FDA approval by June 2001, BioChem management concluded that an other than temporary impairment did not exist.
In February 2002, FDA approval was received to sell the product into the United States.
Subsequent to the approval, structural changes were made to the Companys holding in Qualia and the Companys distribution rights for the product, which resulted in the Company owning a 50% interest in a combined structure and releasing the Company from any future funding obligations.
Qualia has continued to incur operating losses since the approval of the product by the FDA, and the Company has recorded its portion of those losses.
b Biovector In late 2000, BioChem management noted that Biovector Therapeutics S. A. Biovector, a privately held French company in which it held a 9.6% interest, had begun to experience financial and operational difficulties.
At that time, management considered whether there was an other than temporary impairment and determined there was not, based on its estimate of the future operations, the historical financial information available and publicly available information.
However, in April 2001, Biovector formally informed its investors that it was experiencing financial difficulties, principally because of an inability to attract additional research and development collaboration partners and an inability to identify additional sources of nancing.
Following the merger with BioChem, the Company made a decision not to invest further money in this entity and to take steps to cancel any contracts therewith.
Based on this decision and the financial difficulties being experienced by Biovector, the Company determined that it was appropriate to write-off this investment.
In February 2002, Biovector went into liquidation.
80 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 23 Other expense, net continued c Immunosystems In January 1999, BioChem adopted a formal plan to dispose of its diagnostic operations and at that time recorded an impairment of $8.8 million to reect the net assets at the estimated realizable value.
In March 2000, BioChem made the decision to divest of certain of its diagnostics operations Immunosystems to a management-led group.
It did so in exchange for a debenture of $35.8 million and an agreement that BioChem would act as a guarantor of certain long-term debt of Immunosystems, in the amount of 37.3 million Italian Lira $18.1 million as of December 31, 2000.
As the risk and rewards of ownership had not transferred to the management group, BioChem continued to carry the assets on its balance sheet.
The assets, classied as net assets of a business transferred under contractual arrangements, had a carrying value of $35.8 million the same value of the debenture at the time of the merger between Shire and BioChem.
On consummation of the merger, Shire management was concerned as to the recoverability of the debenture the repayment terms of which were contingent on the future cash ows of the underlying Immunosystems business.
Additionally, they were also concerned that they would be required, at some stage, to make a cash payment pursuant to the third-party guarantee.
While the liability related to the third-party guarantee was in substance already recognized by Shire i. e. it formed part of the carrying value of the net assets of $35.8 million, the Company was concerned over a potential cash outow of $18.1 million, combined with the legal fees necessary to pursue collection on the debenture.
This concern was substantial, resulting in Shire managements revisiting all agreements with the management-led group which bought the Immunosystems operations.
As a result of these negotiations, the following was agreed: The debenture was eliminated in full: Shares representing a 19.9% interest in Immunosystems were legally transferred back to the Company: and Shire was released from the guarantee of the third-party debt.
Based on these negotiations, the Company recorded an impairment of $28.7 million, i. e. 80.1% of the carrying value of the assets classied as Net assets of a business transferred under contractual arrangement.
The remaining balance of $7.1 million was reclassied to cost investments.
The Company subsequently recorded an impairment of $2.1 million against the carrying value of the retained interest of 19.9% based on its estimate of the fair value thereof.
24 Retirement benets a Personal dened contribution pension plans The Company makes contributions to dened contribution retirement plans that together cover substantially all employees.
For the dened contribution retirement plans, the level of the Companys contribution is xed at a set percentage of employees pay.
Company contributions to personal dened contribution pension plans totaled $16.1 million, $6.8 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and were charged to operations as they became payable.
b Dened benefit pension plan Roberts, a company with whom the Company merged in December 1999, operated a dened SERP for certain US employees, which was established in 1998.
This plan was available to former employees of Roberts who met certain age and service requirements.
As part of the restructuring of the Company following the Roberts merger, the SERP was closed to new members and contributions ceased being paid into the plan for existing members.
As part of this arrangement, the Company paid a lump sum contribution into the plan of $18.0 million, the result of which is that the Company has no future contributions under the plan.
In accordance with EITF 97-14, the asset and liability of $12.0 million and $8.9 million, respectively, are shown on the balance sheet within the categories Other non-current assets and Other non-current liabilities.

The valuation allowance relates to the deferred tax assets arising from overseas tax operating loss carry-forwards and capital loss carry-forwards, which have no expiration date.
The utilization of operating loss carry forwards is, however, restricted to the taxable income of the subsidiary generating the losses.
In addition, capital loss carry-forwards can only be offset against capital gains.
As of December 31, 2003, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, and reasonable and feasible tax-planning strategies, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benets of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances.
However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.
The Company recognizes a deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments.
The Company does not, however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries located outside the UK, where, in management's opinion, such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in these operations, will be remitted in a tax free liquidation, or will be remitted as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits.

The fair value of stock options used to compute pro forma net income and per share disclosures is the estimated present value at grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 Year ended December 31, $000 $000 $000 Risk-free interest rate 1.89 - 3.40% 1.90 - 5.33% 3.43 - 5.22% Expected dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Expected life 5 years 5 years 5 years Expected volatility 60.0% 55.2% 59.5% Directors and employees have been granted options over ordinary shares under the following eight stock option plans: i Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive Share Option Scheme - Parts A and B Executive Scheme Options granted under the Executive Scheme are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless Shires share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period.
If Shires share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
On February 28, 2000, the Remuneration Committee of the Board exercised its powers to amend the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme so as to include a cliff vesting provision.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the Executive Scheme.
ii Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 Executive Scheme Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme vest six weeks prior to the expiry date.
If it increases by at least 14.5% per annum over the same three year period, the option may be exercised up to 60% of the shares covered by the option.
Given Shires development, it was considered appropriate that an earnings per share EPS based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
Therefore, the performance criteria was amended so that an option would only become exercisable in full if Shires fully diluted EPS growth over a three year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Prices Index RPI on average a year for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 3% per annum directors, RPI plus 5% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 5% per annum Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 7% per annum Over 301% of salary RPI plus 9% per annum 84 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements In thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 27 Stock incentive plans continued The new EPS performance criteria apply to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
The retest will be applied only where Shires EPS growth has fallen short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three year period from grant.
