Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2003 1.
Accounting policies Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
No profit and loss account is presented for Celltech Group plc, as provided by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The results of businesses acquired are included in the Group accounts from their date of acquisition unless they are held for immediate disposal.
Income recognition Revenue from product sales is recorded as turnover at the invoiced amount excluding sales and value added taxes less estimated provisions for product returns, wholesale chargebacks and rebates given to Medicaid, managed care and other customers.
Cash discounts for prompt payment are also deducted from sales on an accrual basis.
Revenue is recognised when title passes, which is usually either on shipment or on receipt of goods by the customer, depending on local trading terms.
Royalties are recorded as turnover and recognised on a time accrual basis unless there remains uncertainty over their collection, in which case recognition is deferred until such uncertainties are removed, which is typically on cash receipt.
Revenue under research and development reimbursement contracts, where there is no obligation to repay such amounts, is recognised as the related costs are incurred and is recorded as a credit to research and development expenditure.
Income associated with performance milestones is recognised based upon the occurrence of the event that triggers the milestone payment, as defined in the respective agreements, and is recorded as Other income.
Other payments received, such as licence fees, are assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature of the payment and the ongoing collaboration, if any, with the third party and any possible related continuing obligations.
Depending on the nature of the arrangement, amounts received may be recognised immediately as a component of Other income or deferred over the development or other appropriate period.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net separable assets acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill arising after 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, normally not exceeding 20 years, on a straight-line basis.
Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves and upon disposal would be charged to the profit and loss account.
Intangibles Intangible assets represent acquired licences, patents, platform technologies and marketing rights, where these relate to specific compounds, products or know-how that are being developed or used for commercial applications.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business are capitalised separately where their value can be measured reliably: otherwise they are treated as part of goodwill acquired with that business.
Separately capitalised intangible assets are stated at cost less provision for amortisation.
Intangible assets in relation to licences, patents and marketing rights are amortised over their estimated useful lives to match the sales of the related products or, where this is not readily identifiable, on a straight-line basis.
Estimated useful lives are reviewed annually and are generally presumed not to exceed 20 years.
Platform technologies supporting the Groups discovery research strategy are considered to have an indefinite life and consequently are subject to annual reviews and amortised as necessary if impairment is considered to have taken place.
Research and Development Research and development expenses include related salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities and allocations of appropriate administrative overheads.
Research and development costs also include activities such as product registration and regulatory costs.
All such costs are charged to research and development expenditure as incurred.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on all fixed assets at rates calculated to write the cost of each asset down to estimated residual values evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Leasehold properties and improvements the shorter of 20 years or the lease term Freehold buildings 50 years Freehold land no depreciation Plant and machinery 2 to 10 years Celltech Annual Report 2003 53 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Stocks Stock of material for use in scheduled clinical trials is written off to investment in research and development upon use or at termination of the trial.
Other stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leased assets Assets acquired under finance leasing arrangements are capitalised at cost upon inception and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Outstanding future lease obligations are shown in Creditors.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Foreign currencies The profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange, other than substantial exceptional items which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
The adjustment to closing rates for the year is taken to reserves.
Balance sheets are translated at closing rates.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation at closing rates of the opening balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are taken to reserves, less exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Tax charges and credits arising on such items are also taken to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related foreign currency contract.
Monetary amounts denominated in a foreign currency are translated at closing rates at the year end.
Preference share dividends Accumulated unpaid preference share dividends have been accounted for as a reserves accrual.
During the year ended 31 December 2003 the preference shares in existence were redeemed see note 24.
Pensions The Group operates contributory and non-contributory defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees.
The scheme funds of the defined benefit plans are administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid to the schemes in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries.
The Groups contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
As permitted by SSAP 24, and as indicated in note 27, the defined benefit schemes of certain overseas subsidiaries are accounted for under local GAAP due to the difficulties and cost of obtaining the necessary actuarial information.
Payments to defined contributions schemes are expensed as incurred.
Equity investments Current asset equity investments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining net realisable values, market values are used in the case of listed investments and Directors estimates are used in the case of unlisted investments.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except as otherwise required by FRS 19 on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which future reversals of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Contingent liabilities The Group is involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business, as discussed in the contingent liabilities note to the financial statements see note 28.
Provision is made in the accounts for all liabilities which might be reasonably expected to materialise from these claims.
Financial instruments The Group uses financial instruments, in particular forward exchange contracts, to manage the financial risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the financing of those foreign activities.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
A discussion of how the Group manages its financial risks is included in the Financial Review and in note 21.
The primary financial instruments used by the Group are forward exchange contracts which are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts in foreign currencies.
As the hedges are not absolutely matched to specific receivables, gains and losses are not recognised until such time as they have been realised.
The aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed in note 21 to the accounts.
Analysis of turnover, profit and net assets Turnover is represented by product sales and royalties receivable during the year.
Income receivable as milestones arising from research and development collaborations is treated as other operating income.
2003 2002 i Turnover by geographical destination m m USA 243.7 231.8 UK 51.1 41.9 Rest of Europe 51.1 48.5 Rest of world 7.4 7.4 Total 353.3 329.6 Turnover comprises 259.2 million 2002: 252.9 million of product sales and 94.1 million 2002: 76.7 million of royalty income.
Royalty income includes 10.5 million of forward hedging exchange gains.
In the year ended 31 December 2002 foreign exchange gains of 3.7 million are included in cost of sales.
The Group considers that the revised 2003 presentation reflects more appropriately the nature of the hedging transaction.

Other income 2003 2002 m m Pfizer CDP870 milestone 6.4 Other milestone income 1.5 1.7 Disposal of product licences 0.5 Other collaboration income 0.5 Total 2.5 8.1 During the year Pfizer gave notice of their intention to terminate their participation in the development of CDP870 from February 2004, consequently no further income will be received from Pfizer with regard to this collaboration.
An amount of 4.8 million 2002: 5.4 million is held on the balance sheet within accruals and deferred income, in respect of Pfizers upfront contribution to the development of CDP870 in the Crohns disease indication.
This amount has been deferred and is being taken to income over the remaining development period, in order to match the revenue with the associated cost.
Research and development expenditure in 2003 is shown net of the 0.6 million 2002: 3.7 million of the upfront contribution utilised during the year.

In addition in 2002, there was a provision release of 3.1 million note 20 and a 0.9 million loss on the disposal of equity investments note 16.
Fees paid to auditors The following summarises the audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor, KPMG Audit Plc: 2003 2002 m m Audit services 0.4 0.3 Further assurance services 0.3 0.1 Tax services compliance 0.2 0.2 Tax services advisory 0.1 0.2 Total 1.0 0.8 The Company audit fee amounted to 25,000 2002: 25,000.
There are no fees charged to the Company for other services.
Exceptional items 2003 2002 m m European sales force restructuring 9.0 Write-off CDP571 stocks 7.5 Development restructuring 1.5 Thiemann asset write-down 0.9 Operating exceptional charge 18.9 Loss on the termination of operations 14.6 Provision against fixed asset investment 7.0 Exceptional items before taxation 40.5 Exceptional tax items note 8 31.7 Exceptional items 8.8 Of the total exceptional charge of 40.5 million before taxation, 20.0 million will result in a cash outflow for the Group and 20.5 million represents asset write-downs.
The non-cash items are the write-off of the investment in Neogenesis and CDP571 stocks together totalling 14.5 million, tangible fixed asset impairments of 4.5 million see note 12 and 1.5 million of inventory write-downs at the Santa Ana manufacturing facility.
The total cash expenditure on exceptional items in the year ended 31 December 2003 was 8.9 million 8.7 million of items booked in the current year and 0.2 million of prior year items, leaving a balance of 11.3 million to be spent primarily during 2004.
The total cash cost of 20.0 million includes 14.5 million of redundancy and related costs.
Operating exceptional items European sales force restructuring During the year the UK, French, German and Spanish sales forces have been restructured from primary care to specialist focus.
The majority of the costs in all locations relate to provisions for redundancy and related expenditure.
As at 31 December, 2003, 4.8 million of this provision remained to be utilised.
Exceptional items continued Write-off of CDP571 stocks Following a review of CDP571 undertaken during 2003, it was determined that the commercial opportunities for this product, including its use on a named patient basis, would not be actively pursued.
Consequently, the stock of CDP571 held as at 31 December 2002 7.5 million has been written down to nil.
Development restructuring These costs relate primarily to the Groups announced reorganisation of the development functions of the Group based in Slough and Cambridge.
The charge relates to provision for redundancy costs and external consulting costs.
As at 31 December 2003, 0.9 million of the total provision remained to be utilised.
Thiemann asset write-down With the acquisition of Thiemann in 2001, the Group inherited a freehold building in Waltrop in north-east Germany.
During 2002, Celltechs German operations relocated to new leased offices in the Essen area of Germany.
The charge in 2003 reflects a write-down to net realisable value of the Waltrop site.
Loss on termination of operations The table below sets out the loss on termination of operations: m Closure of Seattle research operations 5.6 Closure of Santa Ana manufacturing facility 4.5 OGS closure costs 4.5 Total 14.6 Closure of Seattle research operation Following a review of Celltechs long-term research and development needs, the decision was made to close its Seattle research facility.
This closure has resulted in an exceptional charge of 5.6 million, reflecting provision for redundancy costs, short-term lease commitments and writing down the remaining book value of the facility to nil.
As at 31 December 2003, 3.4 million of the provision remained to be utilised.
Closure of Santa Ana manufacturing facility On 3 June 2003 Celltech announced the closure of its manufacturing facility in Santa Ana, California.
The site produced various methylphenidate products.
Production associated with the tableting and packaging of these products has been transferred to the Groups facility in Rochester, New York.
The provision for closure costs relates primarily to redundancies, lease commitments and asset write-downs.
As at 31 December 2003, 0.5 million of the provision remained to be utilised.
OGS closure costs Following Celltechs acquisition of OGS, a substantial restructuring of the operations was undertaken.
The charge relates primarily to provision for redundancy costs for staff and development spend on projects to be discontinued.
As at 31 December 2003 1.7 million of the provision remained to be utilised.
Provision against fixed asset investment Neogenesis investment write-off In view of the current environment for biotechnology IPOs, the Directors have determined that the estimated net realisable value of Celltechs investment in Neogenesis in the event of a trade sale is nil, leading to a write-down of 7.0 million see note 13.

Taxation 2003 2002 m m UK corporation tax at 30% 2002: 30% 1.3 0.7 Utilisation of tax losses 1.3 0.7 UK corporation tax Overseas federal and state tax 7.6 4.7 Overseas deferred tax 31.5 2.9 Overseas taxation 23.9 7.6 Deferred tax credit on goodwill 4.7 5.1 Taxation charge 28.6 2.5 The table below reconciles the actual current tax charge to the expected tax rate, computed by applying the UK tax rate of 30% 2002: 30% to the loss on ordinary activities before taxation: 2003 2002 m m Expected tax credit at UK corporation tax rate 24.8 13.0 Permanent difference on goodwill 24.5 23.3 Restructuring costs see below 9.5 4.7 Difference in local tax rates 0.1 0.3 Utilisation of losses 1.3 Other 1.5 0.1 Current taxation charge 7.6 4.7 The deferred taxation provision at the end of the year is set out below: 2003 2002 m m Accelerated capital allowances 2.2 3.6 Goodwill deferred tax asset 4.7 Other non-current tax liabilities 22.8 53.7 Deferred taxation provision 20.3 57.3 58 Celltech Annual Report 2003 8.
Taxation continued The movement in the provision in the year is set out in note 20.
There are taxation losses of approximately 289 million 2002: 291 million which have not been recognised.
Exceptional and goodwill items 2003 m Tax credit on exceptional items 3.2 Release of other non-current tax liabilities 28.5 Total exceptional tax items 31.7 FRS 19 deferred tax credit on goodwill 4.7 Exceptional tax and goodwill items 36.4 Tax credits on exceptional items arising during the year are primarily in respect of restructuring charges outside the UK.
Where restructuring charges have led to an increase in taxation losses, the benefit of such losses have not been recognised.
In addition, as a result of the Group resolving a number of outstanding tax issues with various tax authorities during the course of the year, an amount of 28.5 million held primarily by Medeva at January 2000 has been released as an exceptional credit.
FRS 19 Deferred Tax requires that the Group recognises deferred tax assets in respect of the timing difference associated with goodwill.
This has resulted in the Group recognising a deferred tax asset of 4.7 million in the year.
It is anticipated that additional deferred tax assets will be recognised in subsequent years before reversing in accordance with the nature of the timing difference.
Earnings per share The basic loss per share is based upon a loss of 54.0 million 2002: loss of 46.0 million after deduction of preference share dividends of 0.1 million 2002: 0.2 million and a weighted average number of shares in issue of 276.4 million 2002: 275.4 million.
The earnings per share before goodwill and exceptional items is provided based on a profit of 44.3 million 2002: profit of 42.6 million.
This is reconciled to the loss of 54.0 million 2002: loss of 46.0 million as set out below: 2003 2002 m m Attributable loss 54.0 46.0 Goodwill amortisation note 11 94.2 93.7 Exceptional items note 5 40.5 Tax on goodwill and exceptional tax items note 8 36.4 5.1 Adjusted profit 44.3 42.6 The Directors believe that earnings per share based on the adjusted profit provides useful additional information for shareholders.
The diluted earnings loss per share takes into account the dilutive effect of share options and convertible preference shares.
A reconciliation between the number of shares used in the calculation of the basic and diluted earnings loss per share is shown in the table below: 2003 2002 Number Number m m Basic weighted average number of shares 276.4 275.4 Share options 1.1 0.6 Convertible preference shares 0.5 1.9 Diluted number of shares 278.0 277.9 Due to the loss-making position of the Group, the exercise of share options and conversion of preference shares do not increase the basic loss per share and therefore, according to FRS 14 the basic and diluted loss per share remain the same.
The 2003 and 2002 earnings per share before goodwill and exceptional items and the preference share dividend have been adjusted for the dilutive effect.
Profit attributable to members of the holding company In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The profit in the financial statements of the Company was 4.9 million 2002: profit 6.8 million.

Intangible fixed assets Goodwill Intangible assets Group m m m Cost At 1 January 2003 1,011.7 48.1 1,059.8 Additions 1.8 1.8 Acquisition of OGS 8.1 8.1 Exchange 1.0 1.0 At 31 December 2003 1,019.8 48.9 1,068.7 Provisions for amortisation At 1 January 2003 618.9 1.0 619.9 Amortisation charged in the year 94.2 3.2 97.4 At 31 December 2003 713.1 4.2 717.3 Net book value At 31 December 2003 306.7 44.7 351.4 At 31 December 2002 392.8 47.1 439.9 The goodwill amortisation charge reflects a full year of ownership of Medeva 88.3 million, Cistron 0.7 million and Thiemann 4.7 million and an eight-month charge in respect of OGS of 0.5 million see note 22.
Medeva and Thiemann goodwill is being amortised over seven years.
Cistron and OGS goodwill is being amortised over 10 years.
Included within intangible assets is a payment of 11.8 million to Abgenix for extensive access to its SLAM Selective Lymphocyte Antibody Method technology.
Amortisation has not been charged on this in the year as the Directors consider that it has an indefinite life.
As required by FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, the Directors have undertaken an impairment review to support the carrying value.
The SLAM technology has been combined with the Groups existing antibody technologies in order to expand the breadth of the antibody pipeline and extend the repertoire of drug targets.
The technology is seen as core to Celltechs research activities and will continue to benefit the Group for the foreseeable future, accordingly Celltech has rebutted the presumption that useful economic life should be no longer than 20 years as permitted by FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
As required by FRS 10, this matter will be kept under review and SLAM technology will be subject to an annual impairment review.
In July 2002, the Group announced that it had entered into arrangements with Pharmacia now part of Pfizer to access its product Dipentum in the US and European markets.
The European product rights were acquired outright for $20 million.
The US agreement provided Celltech with exclusive sales, marketing and distribution rights until January 2005, at which time Celltech can acquire the product outright at its option for $5 million.
The substance of the US transaction is that of an outright acquisition settled through a series of payments which are capital in nature over the period to January 2005, followed by the $5 million exercise element.
In accordance with FRS 5, Reporting the Substance of Transactions, the Group has capitalised the total of these payments of $35.4 million.
The total capitalised for the European and US rights is thus $55.4 million 35.3 million.
The total capital payments made during 2003 amounted to 11.7 million.
The Dipentum asset is being amortised over 15 years, which is based on the Directors estimate of the products useful economic life.
In estimating the useful life the Directors have had regard to market projections, barriers to entry and risk of generic products and substitutes.
Dipentum sales recorded by the Group in 2003 are 17.1 million 2002: 4.6 million part year only.
The Group has assets in the course of construction or commissioning which are not depreciated of 9.6 million 2002: 18.4 million.
Of the 9.6 million, 6.2 million are included within the long leasehold category and 3.4 million are within plant and machinery.
The assets in the course of construction relate primarily to the expansion of the laboratory facilities at Slough and an upgrade to the manufacturing facility at Ashton.
Capital expenditure of 16.2 million in the year took place principally on the UK Research and Development facilities based in Slough 7.7 million, the Ashton manufacturing site 1.3 million and the Rochester manufacturing site 3.1 million.
The freehold land and building addition of $2 million 1.1 million relates to the property acquired from Dr Ando in a related party transaction note 25.
Of the total expenditure of 16.2 million, 1.2 million was accrued at the year end relating to spend at Slough and Ashton.
Transfers relate to certain assets in the course of construction which were initially capitalised within freehold buildings, but which have been transferred to plant and machinery once commissioned.
On the disposal of fixed assets no material profit nor loss arose.

The net figure of 106.1 million is the Group investment in OGS as shown in note 22.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings have been subordinated by Celltech Group plc in favour of any third party liabilities that may accrue.

Investments continued Movements in investments during the year are as follows: Group Company m m At 1 January 2003 40.2 292.9 PowderJect loan notes repaid 31.0 Acquisition of own shares 1.4 1.4 Accrual for deferred bonus scheme 0.8 0.8 Write-down of Neogenesis investment 7.0 Movement in loans to subsidiary undertakings 89.3 Acquisition of OGS 107.3 At 31 December 2003 2.8 311.5 ESOPs Employee share schemes set up as trusts hold Celltech Group plc ordinary shares to meet potential obligations under the schemes.
Options are satisfied by the transfer of shares held in trust where newly issued shares are not used.
The Chiroscience 1994 Share Ownership Plan Trust holds 255,346 shares at 31 December 2003, of which 43,806 are to meet options vested but not yet exercised under the Chiroscience 1997 All Employee Share Option Scheme.
It is the Groups intention that the shares over and above those required to meet the 43,806 granted and vested options will be used to meet obligations under other schemes in the future.
On 13 January 2003, the Celltech Group Employee Share Trust purchased 400,000 shares with funds gifted by Celltech Group plc.
At the year end the Celltech Group Employee Share Trust holds 551,756 shares, of which 77,718 are to meet options granted under the Deferred Bonus Plan which have not been exercised but have vested, and 377,632 which have not yet vested.
The book value of all Company shares held in trust has been written down by 0.3 million, being the cost of shares over which options have vested.
The cost of shares over which options have been granted but not vested at 31 December 2003 is accrued over the period to vesting.
At the year end the accrual is 0.5 million.
In total, the amount accrued or written down is 0.8 million, as shown in the table above.
The total market value of the Companys shares held in trust at 31 December 2003 is 3.1 million, based on the year-end price of 3.78.
Other investments As at 31 December 2003, the Group has one remaining loan note due from Tillotts Pharma AG.
This loan note was issued to Medeva PLC on 26 April 1999.
The loan note bears interest at 4% per annum and is repayable in annual instalments dependent on the underlying adjusted profits of Tillotts Pharma AG, or at the latest by 31 December 2011.
In 2001, Celltech acquired a minority interest in Neogenesis for $10 million 7.0 million.
With the acquisition of OGS the Group inherited a further 4.3 million stake in Neogenesis.
The total investment has been written down to nil as at 31 December 2003, based on the expected realisable value.
This is due to the shareholder structure which allows series A-D shareholders to recover their investment before series E investors.
Both the initial Celltech holding and that inherited with OGS are part of the series E shares.
Celltech and other series E shareholders would only recover their investment if the sales proceeds of Neogenesis exceeded $33.0 million.
For the reasons set out in note 5, the Celltech Directors do not consider this likely.
The existing Celltech holding has been charged as an exceptional item in the period, whereas the OGS holding was written off as a fair value adjustment to the acquired assets of that company.

The investment was inherited as part of the OGS acquisition.
The market value of the Groups holding as at 31 December 2003 was 1.1 million.
During 2002, the Group completed the process of disposing of the equity investments which had been inherited as part of the Medeva acquisition and which had been held by that company due to its research and development relationships.
In total during 2002 the Group disposed of 937,000 shares in Targeted Genetics Corporation and 207,500 shares in Matrix Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The disposals generated cash of 1.1 million and resulted in a loss of 0.9 million which was recorded within research and development expenditure.
Cash and liquid resources Celltech manages its funds in a portfolio of cash, short-term bank deposits and liquid resources, with maturities chosen to meet its shortand medium-term requirements.
The liquid resources are in fully negotiable instruments, including treasury bills, certificates of deposit, bills of exchange and commercial paper, and are managed by Royal London Cash Management and Royal Bank of Scotland.

Following termination of the alternative financing arrangements for methylphenidate during 2003, the Group received 2.7 million in respect of the insurance deposit 2002: 2.7 million included as a liquid resource.
This amount was returned to the Group net of interest and fees.
In addition, an amount of 4.5 million has been released from a segregated fund previously held in the name of the Company and managed by one of the Groups fund managers in respect of the alternative financing arrangement.

The opening provision of 3.0 million included 2.0 million relating to ML Laboratories see below and other provisions of 1.0 million.
The profit and loss account charge is the cash element of the exceptional items see note 5.
The utilisation is the spend on exceptional items of 8.9 million, along with 2.0 million paid to ML Laboratories and 0.1 million of other.
In 2002, Celltech negotiated a settlement to terminate certain co-development relationships with Innovata Biomed, a subsidiary of ML Laboratories which had been inherited with the Medeva acquisition.
The terms of the termination included a 4.0 million payment to ML Laboratories of which the final 2.0 million was paid in January 2003.
In total, the settlement of this liability resulted in a credit of 3.1 million to the Group profit and loss account taken in the year ended 31 December 2002. ii Since 20 September 2001, the Group has been required to increase its levels of self insurance in respect of methylphenidate.
In addition, the Group has decided to retain a level of self insurance in respect of all product liability up to an annual limit of $13.5 million, as well as self insurance in respect of methylphenidate of up to $20 million.
Whilst no methylphenidate claims have been received since 20 September 2001, as at 31 December 2003 the Group has provided 5.4 million based on an external review of the likely liability associated with incidents that may arise from past sales of methylphenidate prior to 20 September 2003 and across all products after 19 September 2003.
A further 0.5 million has been provided for product recall and other liabilities for which the Group has no external insurance.
iii On the acquisition of OGS the Group provided for certain onerous obligations.
These relate primarily to lease obligations, committed development spend on non-valuable projects and other contractual obligations see note 22.
There are no provisions for liabilities and charges in the Company.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The disclosures below, with the exception of currency exposures, exclude short-term debtors and creditors where permissible under FRS 13.
The following categories of short-term creditor are included below: borrowing and leasing obligations and foreign currency denominated deferred consideration.
The main risks arising from the Groups use of financial instruments and the strategy for managing these are set out below: Interest rate risk The Group repaid the private placement fixed borrowings of 31.2 million US$50 million in December 2003.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient long-term funding and committed bank facilities to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
As at 31 December 2003 the Group had 75 million of committed facilities 2002: 107.2 million of which 75 million were undrawn 2002: 76.0 million see section iv of note below.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 23% 2002: 50% of the Group net assets excluding goodwill are in the US.
The Group does not currently actively hedge against the effect of exchange rate differences resulting from the translation of foreign currency earnings, but does, where appropriate, seek to hedge significant transaction exposures, which includes hedging material surplus balances not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit.
The Group uses financial derivatives, in particular forward currency contracts, to manage the financial risks associated with the Groups underlying business activity.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Credit risk A large number of major international financial institutions are counterparties to the foreign exchange contracts and deposits transacted by the Group.
Counterparties for such transactions entered into during the year have a long-term credit rating of A or better.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties, together with their credit ratings, and, by policy, limits the amount of agreements or contracts it enters into with any one party.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Cash at bank and liquid resources principally comprise money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
The investments are with counterparties having strong credit ratings.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty or the non-payment of an account receivable to be unlikely, other than as already provided for in the accounts.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Floating rate financial assets comprise cash deposits in the money market, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
These include deposits where the interest rate is fixed until maturity but, as the original maturity is less than one year, they are classified as floating rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate deposits comprise 1.9 million 2002: 32.9 million of convertible loan notes see note 13 for duration carrying a weighted average interest rate to maturity of 4% 2002: 6.8%.
The interest-free assets relate to long-term debtors see note 15.
In 2002 the interest-free assets related to the investment in Neogenesis see note 13 and long-term debtors see note 15. ii Currency exposures The table below shows the Groups transactional currency exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses in the profit and loss account.

Neogenesis is an unlisted company and the total investment has been written down to nil as at 31 December 2003 see note 13.
The market value of the Groups holding in BioInvent as at 31 December 2003 is 1.1 million see note 16.
In 2002, the Groups share price as of 31 December 2002 was used to determine the fair value of the preference shares.
Other amounts are determined to be equal to their book values.
vi Gains and losses on hedges No financial instruments were held for the purposes of dealing or other financial instrument trading activities.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings OGS Fair value On 26 February 2003, Celltech announced the terms of a Cash Offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of OGS.
On 11 April 2003, the Board of OGS recommended that shareholders accept the Offer by Celltech and by the 14 April 2003 the Group held more than 50% of the shares of the entity.
The Offer of 1.82 for each OGS share, valued the company at 102.3 million 56 million issued shares at the date of acquisition, plus a further 0.9 million of subsequent option exercises at 1.82, less 1.2 million in option receipts.
On 4 June 2003, Celltech announced that it had purchased or received valid acceptances in respect of 90.3% of the issued share capital of OGS, and had commenced the procedure for the compulsory acquisition of the remaining OGS shares.
On 18 July 2003, the process was completed, and OGS was fide-listed from the London Stock Exchange on 21 July 2003.
The total cost of the OGS acquisition was 106.1 million which includes 3.8 million of expenses.
The assets and liabilities of OGS acquired are as follows: Business held Fair value Total fair Book value for resale adjustments value m m m m Fixed assets a 13.6 8.0 5.6 Investments b 11.3 5.8 4.7 0.8 Stocks 0.2 0.2 Debtors c 9.4 2.9 2.9 3.6 Cash and liquid resources 126.6 126.6 Creditors d 8.5 0.7 3.5 4.3 Provisions e 34.2 34.2 Deferred income 8.2 8.2 Businesses held for resale and acquisition of Confirmant f 8.0 2.5 5.5 Net assets acquired 144.4 46.4 98.0 Total consideration 106.1 Goodwill 8.1 Fair value adjustments have been made to the book value of the assets and liabilities to adjust, where applicable, the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
The above fair values are preliminary and will be further reviewed based on additional information available at 30 June 2004 and 31 December 2004.
Based on the preliminary fair value, 8.1 million of goodwill arises on this transaction.
The goodwill has been capitalised and is being amortised over 10 years, which is based on the Directors estimate of useful economic life.
Celltech Annual Report 2003 69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22.
Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings continued The material fair value adjustments to the net assets of OGS were determined as follows: a Tangible fixed assets have been written off, as they will not be used by Celltech and recoverable values are considered to be negligible.
Intangible assets have not been capitalised separately from goodwill as the value of the business is considered to be primarily in early-stage oncology research projects.
Celltech does not consider that a reliable valuation can be made of such projects suitable for capitalisation separate from goodwill.
b Investments have been written down to recoverable value based on market value and have been classified on the Celltech balance sheet as equity investments.
OGS investments included a 4.3 million stake in Neogenesis which has been written down to nil see notes 5 and 13. c Debtors have been written down to recoverable value.
A significant proportion of the OGS debtors were prepayments for activities and projects which were discontinued by Celltech.
Consequently these had no value to Celltech.
d OGS creditor and accrual balances inherited were adjusted in the light of the actual settlements made post-acquisition.
e Fair value provisions have been established for onerous obligations inherited with the acquisition.
These relate primarily to lease obligations, committed development spend on non-valuable projects and other contractual obligations, including payments to former senior executives who had change of ownership termination clauses in their service contracts.
f The proteomics business of OGS was held for resale.
The fair value represents the estimated result of the business prior to any disposal together with the anticipated net proceeds from the assets inherited.
The table below sets out the material balance aggregated on to the businesses held for resale line on acquisition.
m Net receipt from termination of Confirmant Limited joint venture see note 23 6.4 Other proteomics 0.9 Business held for resale 5.5 At the half year, the businesses held for resale line was reported as being 8.0 million, the adjusted fair value at 31 December 2003 reflects the unsuccessful outcome of efforts to dispose of the business see note 23.
Due to the businesses no longer being held for disposal as at 31 December 2003 the remaining assets and liabilities of the proteomics business and Confirmant Limited are included within the usual statutory headings.
Information on OGS pre-acquisition results The last financial statements of OGS were prepared for the year to 31 December 2002, and were audited by Ernst & Young.
The summarised profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses for OGS for the period from 1 January 2003 to the end of April, the period prior to the effective date of acquisition, and for the preceding year are as follows: 1 Jan to 30 Apr unaudited 31 Dec 2002 m m Turnover 3.7 14.0 Net operating costs 16.8 54.8 Operating loss 13.1 40.8 Share of joint venture loss 1.6 4.4 Interest receivable 1.9 6.4 Amount written off investments 2.4 Loss on ordinary activities before taxation 12.8 41.2 Tax on loss on ordinary activities 3.3 Loss on ordinary net activities after taxation 12.8 37.9 Due to the significant restructuring undertaken on OGS, the above results are not indicative of the impact of the acquisition on Celltechs result.
The turnover and operating losses of the business, before restructuring and goodwill items, consolidated by the Group for the period since acquisition are nil and 3.9 million respectively.
In addition, a charge of 4.5 million is included within exceptional items for OGS in respect of integration and products that are being discontinued.
Both these amounts are reflected in the cash flow analysis of the impact of the acquisition of OGS shown below.
Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings continued Impact of OGS acquisition on cash flows OGS contribution to the Group cashflow since the date of acquisition can be summarised as follows: m Operating result 3.9 million operating loss, integration costs 4.5 million 8.4 Cashflow on fair value provisions 22.5 Working capital movements 4.4 Net cash outflow from operating activities 35.3 Interest received 2.1 Taxation 3.6 Cash funding in respect of businesses held for resale 0.9 Cash outflow before use of liquid resources 30.5 The total impact on cash and liquid resources, including acquisition flows for the year ended 31 December 2003 but excluding the cost of continuing activities, is set out below: m Cost of shares 102.3 Transaction costs 3.8 106.1 Cash and liquid resources inherited with OGS 126.6 Cash outflow since date of acquisition 30.5 Net Confirmant cash acquired 6.4 Costs in relation to continuing activities 3.9 Total inflow for the year ended 31 December 2003 0.3 23.
Businesses held for resale On acquisition of OGS, Celltech identified the proteomics business as being held for immediate disposal.
After significant initial interest the last potential buyer for the proteomics business withdrew from negotiations in late November 2003.
At that point, a decision was taken to terminate the operations immediately.
Consequently, from that date onwards, it was no longer appropriate to treat the business as a business held for disposal and, therefore, as part of the OGS closure costs a charge of 0.5 million was made in respect of proteomics redundancies.
OGS was party to a 50:50 joint venture with Marconi, in a company known as Confirmant Limited Confirmant.
The purpose of the joint venture was to integrate and leverage Marconis broadband data transmission capabilities with OGS proteomics database.
Confirmant had initial funding of 30 million contributed equally by Marconi and OGS.
Confirmant operated with a separate management and sales team.
Following the failure to dispose of the proteomics business, agreement was reached with Marconi to terminate the joint venture and distribute the remaining cash.
This resulted in a payment to Marconi of 4.1 million and OGS then acquired full rights over the remaining 10.5 million of cash and liquid resources within Confirmant.
This net 6.4 million receipt has been included in determining the value of businesses held for disposal in note 22 above.
The payment to Marconi took account of amounts owed to OGS and its share of the Confirmant closure costs.

Related party transaction During the year, Celltech entered into a related party transaction with its new Chief Executive, Dr. Gran Ando.
The transaction involved the acquisition by Celltech on 22 October 2003 of Dr. Andos home in Mendham Borough, New Jersey, USA.
The purpose of the transaction was to expedite Dr. Andos relocation to the United Kingdom.
The agreed acquisition price for the property was $2 million 1.1 million which was based on the mid-point of two independent valuations.
The total cost to Celltech including acquisition-related expenditure amounted to $2,026,842.
The transaction involved full transfer of the rights to the property to Celltech: no further amounts become payable to or from Dr. Ando.
Full settlement of the amounts due to Dr. Ando was made on 22 October 2003.
As at 31 December 2003 the property is still held by Celltech and is included within freehold tangible fixed assets, see note 12.
Financial commitments i Capital expenditure 2003 2002 m m Contracted 7.8 1.2 ii Manufacturing capacity The Group has entered into significant manufacturing capacity arrangements as discussed below: Sandoz formerly Biochemie GmbH Celltech has contracted Sandoz, a subsidiary of Novartis, as a long-term source for the manufacture of its microbially produced antibody products including CDP870.
Celltech has reserved manufacturing capacity beginning 1 January 2004 and ending 31 December 2010.
Celltech has potential take or pay obligations, which are subject to mitigation, under this agreement of approximately 41 million.
Lonza Celltech has contracted Lonza as a long-term manufacturing source and has reserved manufacturing capacity until 31 December 2010.
Under the contract there are varying sums payable each year under take or pay obligations.
The total obligations over the period of the contract, which are subject to mitigation, amount to 14 million.
BioReliance Celltech has a contract with BioReliance enabling the Group to reserve manufacturing capacity.
The current minimum commitment is 2.2 million based on forecast requirements which have been submitted to BioReliance.
iii Leasing Operating and finance lease commitments are disclosed in note 19.
Celltech Annual Report 2003 73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27.
Pension arrangements The Group operates a number of pension schemes, the majority being defined benefit arrangements.
Details of the Groups schemes are as follows: i Pension schemes under SSAP 24 2003 2002 The charge for the year comprises: m m Celltech Pension and Life Assurance Scheme and Medeva Plans 1.6 2.2 US qualified scheme 1.1 US non-qualified scheme 0.2 0.2 Thiemann plan 0.6 0.5 Defined contribution schemes US and UK 3.3 1.6 Total 5.7 5.6 The defined contribution schemes relate primarily to the Celltech Group Personal Pension Plan CGPPP and US 401K plans.
The CGPPP was introduced as of 1 January 2000 for all new UK employees of the Group.
The Celltech Pension and Life Assurance Scheme CP&LAS, the Medeva UK Pension Plan and the Medeva Senior Executive Pension Plan are all closed to new members.
Under the CGPPP the Group contributes 8% of salary to individual plans for employees.
The contribution accrued at the end of the financial year in respect of the Groups UK pension scheme was 0.1 million.
This was paid in accordance with trust rules in January 2004.
Details of the Groups defined benefit schemes are set out below: UK defined benefit Scheme The last full actuarial valuation of the UK schemes for SSAP 24 purposes was undertaken as at 30 September 2002.
However, an actuarial review has been carried out as at 30 September 2003.
The main financial assumptions for the 30 September 2003 review were as follows: Rate of return 6.8% Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% LPI pension increases 2.5% Revaluation in deferment 2.5% Asset valuation method Market value Liability valuation Attained age The assets and liabilities of the scheme were as follows: 30 Sep 2003 m Assets 39.6 Liabilities 44.6 Deficit in the scheme 5.0 The CP&LAS is thus funded at 89% of the liabilities.
The attained age methodology is used to obtain the actuarial valuation for liabilities.
The attained age methodology is the most appropriate in the circumstances of this scheme, which has been closed to new members.
The cash cost of the scheme is identical to the profit and loss charge and consequently there is no SSAP 24 prepayment nor provision.
On the basis of the actuarial reviews, the current average contribution rate paid by the Group is 14.7% of pensionable salaries 2002: 14.7%.
Pension arrangements continued US Qualified Scheme The most recent valuation of the plan under US accounting standards was carried out on 31 December 2003.
At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the plan was 8.9 million and the liabilities were 11.9 million.
Thus the assets of the plan represented 75% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members.
The projected unit method was used to derive the valuation above and the key actuarial assumptions are broadly in line with those set out in ii below.
The US Qualified Scheme was frozen as at 31 December 2002 and, as such, no further benefits accrue to the members.
US Unqualified Scheme The most recent valuation of the plan under US accounting standards was carried out on 31 December 2003.
The liabilities of this unfunded scheme at this date were valued at 2.6 million.
However, the Group is carrying a liability in creditors of 2.5 million against this obligation, and also holds a RABBI account of 2.0 million for this liability see ii below.
The US Unqualified Scheme was frozen as at 31 December 2002 and, as such, no further benefits accrue to the members.
German Thiemann Plan The most recent valuation of the plan was carried out as at 31 December 2003 under IAS 19.
At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the plan was 6.1 million and the liabilities were 12.2 million.
Thus the assets of the plan represented 50% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
However, the Company also holds separate insurance assets of 6.0 million outside of the scheme to cover the deficit.
Thus in total there are assets of 12.1 million available to cover the liability of 12.2 million as set out in the FRS 17 disclosures.
The key actuarial assumptions that were used are as set out in ii below.
ii FRS 17 disclosures The Group has adopted FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, to the extent of the mandated disclosure requirements for the year ended 31 December 2003.
FRS 17 is more prescriptive than SSAP 24 in the assumptions and methodology that must be used in order to assess actuarial liabilities.
In particular, FRS 17 prescribes the use of the projected unit method of valuation and a discount rate obtained from corporate bonds rather than equities.
Because of the low average age of the members of the CP&LAS, the Group considers the SSAP 24 valuation to be more relevant.
The results of the FRS 17 review are presented below.
Qualified independent actuaries updated the actuarial valuations of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2003.
The main financial assumptions used in this update were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 UK US Germany UK US Germany UK US Germany Assumptions %%% %%%%%% Inflation assumptions 2.8 n a 2.0 2.3 3.0 2.0 2.6 3.0 2.0 Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 n a 3.0 3.8 4.1-4.6 3.0 4.1 5.0 3.0 Rate of increase in pension payment 2.1-2.7 1.5 1.9-2.3 2.0 2.0-2.6 2.0 Discount rate 5.4 6.0 5.3 5.5 6.7 6.0 5.9 7.0 6.0 Long-term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 7.8 9.2 n a 7.5 9.0 n a 7.2 10.0 n a Bonds 5.4 6.0 n a 4.5 6.7 n a 5.0 7.0 n a Insurance 4.8 n a 4.5 4.5 n a 3.5 n a n a 3.5 Pension fund deficit The pension fund deficit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard were fully applied.
However, under the current accounting methodology SSAP 24 there are assets and provisions within the balance sheet at 31 December 2003 that would offset the effect on net assets see below of this deficit in the event of a restatement under FRS 17.
If FRS 17 had been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2003, the Groups net assets per the balance sheet would be reduced by 24.2 million 2002: 18.4 million.
Further explanation of this adjustment is included below.
The assets and liabilities of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2003 as calculated in accordance with FRS 17 are shown on page 76.

This account can only be used by the Group to pay the pension liabilities of the US Unqualified Scheme, except in the case of bankruptcy when it would become part of the general pool of assets and pensioners would rank as ordinary creditors.
Included within the insurance assets held in Germany are 6.0 million of insurance arrangements in the Companys own name which were written in order to cover the pension deficits that would otherwise exist in the pension scheme.
There is no intention to use these assets for any purpose other than to cover the deficit and, accordingly, they have been shown as part of the available assets.

Contingent liabilities a The Group has unsecured and undrawn overdraft facilities of 10 million 2002: 11 million net see note 21.
The Company has provided guarantees to finance companies in respect of finance leases to Celltech R&D Limited not exceeding 2.5 million 2002: 2.5 million, of which 1.0 million 2002: 1.4 million has been utilised.
The Company has also provided guarantees to XL Winterthur International of $13.5 million in respect of reinsurance liabilities and 8 million to Sandoz in respect of manufacturing capacity arrangements.
b The principal litigation in which the Group has been involved in 2003 is discussed below.
In common with most trading companies, Celltech and various of its subsidiary undertakings are the subject of a number of legal claims or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot at present be determined.
Provision has been made in these accounts for all liabilities which might be reasonably expected to materialise from these claims.
i Ionamin In July 1997, significant health concerns were raised over the use of the so-called fen-phen diet co-prescription of fenfluramine and phentermine.
These concerns resulted in the voluntary withdrawal from the market of fenfluramine and a related drug dexfenfluramine in September 1997.
These withdrawals were followed by the commencement of a significant number of lawsuits in the US against manufacturers and prescribers of fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine and phentermine.
The most common allegation is that the fen-phen diet caused heart valve problems, neurological dysfunction and, much less frequently, primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs.
Celltech has been named in close to 7,000 of these cases, approximately 1,500 of which were pending as at 31 December 2003.
The Groups involvement derives from the sale by a Celltech subsidiary, since 2 July 1996, of lonamin, the phentermine prescription pharmaceutical acquired from Fisons Corporation Fisons on that date.
At 12 February 2004, the Group had been formally dismissed from approximately 5,370 of these cases without payment of any sums by way of damages or costs to third parties, and dismissals of more than 700 additional cases, also without payment, were agreed to or filed but were not yet effective.
Celltech denies liability on a number of grounds, including, fundamentally, that Ionamin does not cause the health conditions complained of.
Ionamin has been marketed since 1959 and the FDA did not request that Ionamin or any other phentermine be withdrawn from the market.
Moreover, Celltech believes it will be indemnified for any unanticipated liability by Fisons for Ionamin sold prior to 2 July 1996 and by Celltechs product liability insurance carriers for Ionamin sold after 2 July 1996.
Celltechs defence costs are being paid by Fisons and its insurance carriers as required by their contractual indemnities.
Fisons indemnity obligations are guaranteed by Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc, now part of Aventis Pharmaceuticals.
Based on the merits of its defences and based on the third party insurance coverage benefiting Celltech discussed above, Celltech believes that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of the operations.
ii MedImmune Litigation relating to Synagis In 1998 Celltech granted to MedImmune Inc a worldwide non-exclusive licence to use certain of its patents in relation to its humanised antibody preparation, palivizumab sold by MedImmune under the trade name Synagis.
Celltech believe that MedImmunes Synagis product comes within the scope of its patents and that accordingly MedImmune owes significant royalties to Celltech.
MedImmune disputes this and have refused to pay any royalties.
Accordingly Celltech commenced two legal actions against MedImmune one in respect of the US patent the major market for Synagis and the other in respect of the German patent where Synagis is manufactured.
Both actions are subject to the jurisdiction of the UK Courts.
The claim with respect to the US patent was dismissed by the High Court in November 2002.
Celltechs appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed by a majority decision in July 2003 with an Order that Celltech pay MedImmunes legal costs.
As at 31 December 2003, MedImmunes claim for legal costs had been settled and paid by Celltech.
The claim with respect to the German patent is scheduled for hearing in the High Court at the end of March 2004.
On 14 October 2003, Celltech obtained the grant of a further US patent which also falls within the scope of the licence granted to MedImmune.
In January 2004, MedImmune filed a declaratory action in the US District Court for the District of Columbia in respect of this patent seeking a declaration that its Synagis product does not infringe the patent and that the patent is invalid.
This matter also forms the subject of further litigation in the UK.
Since the scope of MedImmunes claims are limited to seeking a declaration that it owes no royalties in respect of Synagis, Celltech has no potential liability under any of this pending litigation save in respect of MedImmunes legal costs should Celltechs claim in the UK Courts fail.
Litigation relating to Boss Cabilly patent interference settlement On 23 December 2003, the US District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgement in favour of Celltech and Genentech that the settlement of the Boss Cabilly patent interference between Celltech and Genentech was immune from claims brought in a lawsuit by MedImmune under antitrust and unfair competition laws.
On 19 February 2004 the Court granted final judgement in favour of Celltech and Genentech on those causes of action.
Claims by MedImmune against Genentech that the Cabilly patent is invalid and not infringed are pending in the same matter, but those claims were not asserted against Celltech.
MedImmune has indicated its intention to 78 Celltech Annual Report 2003 appeal the judgement.
Should MedImmune appeal and ultimately prevail in its claims, Celltech would be liable to pay damages, a reasonable estimate of which cannot be made at this time.
iii 69kD Celltech is the owner of patents for 69kD, the Bordetella pertussis protein also known as Pertactin.
Celltech has granted GlaxoSmithKline an exclusive worldwide licence to use the patents.
Under the terms of the licence, Celltech has the first option to take proceedings to enforce the patents.
Litigation has arisen in Europe involving Celltechs patents and acellular pertussis vaccines owned by Chiron and its subsidiaries.
On 23 July 1998, Celltech issued infringement proceedings in Italy against Chiron for infringement of one of Celltechs patents relating to the 69kD antigen and is seeking an injunction to prevent Chiron from marketing its product.
Chiron is defending that action, and has counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity of the patent.
Court experts have been appointed, but the date when their report will be provided is not known.
This patent is also subject to opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office brought by Chiron on 22 January 1997.
The European Patent Office has determined, in a decision issued in November 2000, that the patent should be revoked.
This decision of the EPO is the subject of an appeal by Celltech which will be heard on 19 March 2004. iv Lonza On 14 July 2003, Celltech announced that it had entered into a long-term supply agreement with Lonza, under which Lonza will manufacture PEGylated antibody fragment based drugs for Celltech at its microbial production facility.
At the same time, Celltech and Lonza announced a settlement for the termination of the CDP571 manufacturing agreement.
The Group had provided as at 31 December 2002 for managements best estimate of the amounts expected to materialise from the termination of this agreement.
The terms of the settlement have not resulted in any additional charge to the profit and loss account.
v Alpharma During 2002 Celltech sold its Armstrong business to Andrx.
This operation had a product supply contract with a customer, Alpharma.
During 2003, Alpharma voluntarily withdrew the product from sale claiming that an element of the production process did not have the required FDA approval.
They have filed a suit against Andrx and Celltech has recently been included as a co-defendant in respect of liabilities arising when Celltech owned the Armstrong business.
Based on the merits of its defence, Celltech believes that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of the Company.
However, if the Company were ultimately held liable, the damages that would be payable could have a material adverse effect a reasonable estimate of which cannot be made at this time on the financial position and results of operations of the Company.
c Self insurance Since 20 September 2001, the Group has been required to increase its levels of self insurance in respect of methylphenidate.
In addition, the Group has decided to retain a level of self insurance in respect of all product liability up to $13.5 million, as well as self insurance in respect of methylphenidate of up to $20 million.
Whilst no methylphenidate claims have been received since 20 September 2001, the Group has provided 5.4 million based on an external review of the likely liability associated with incidents that may arise from past sales of methylphenidate prior to 20 September 2003 and across all products after 19 September 2003.
