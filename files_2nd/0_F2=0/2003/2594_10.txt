Auditors remuneration for the Companys statutory audit was 0.3m 2002: 0.3m.
All of the fees for further assurance services related to due diligence and other duties carried out in respect of acquisitions and disposals of businesses.
The Company believes that, given their detailed knowledge of the Groups operations, its structure and accounting policies and the importance of carrying out detailed due diligence as part of the acquisition process, it is appropriate for this additional work to be carried out by the Companys auditors rather than another firm of accountants.
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit work which the auditors perform, including the fees paid for such work, thus ensuring that their objectivity and independence is not compromised.

24 Bunzl plc 22 Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The funds of the principal schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes in April 2003 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
The most recent actuarial valuations have incorporated the requirements of FRS17 Retirement Benefits in assessing scheme liabilities at 31 December.
Scheme assets for the purpose of FRS17 are stated at their market value at 31 December.
The Group accounts for pension costs in accordance with FRS17.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the Company treats contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme in accordance with the exemption permitted by FRS17.
The Group operates other schemes overseas in accordance with local practice and legislation.
Some of these schemes are externally funded, while others are internally funded.
