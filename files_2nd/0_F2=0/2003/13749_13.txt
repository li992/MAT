64 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements present the financial record for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002.
The subsidiary and associated undertakings in the group operate in the local currency of the country in which they are based.
From a functional perspective, the group regards these operations as being US dollar-based as the transactions of these entities are, insofar as is possible, evaluated in US dollars.
In management accounting terms all companies report in US dollars.
The directors of the company regard the US dollar as the functional currency of the group, being the most representative currency of its operations.
Therefore the consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars.
The exchange rates of rand to US dollar used in preparing the consolidated financial statements were as follows: Weighted Closing average rate rate Year ended 31 March 2002 9.71 11.40 Year ended 31 March 2003 9.50 7.91 The weighted average exchange rates have been calculated based on an average of the exchange rates during the relevant year and weighted according to the turnover of the groups businesses.
Accounting policies Accounting convention The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important group accounting policies is set out below.
Changes in accounting presentation Segmental analyses have been expanded to report in accordance with the basis on which the businesses are managed.
The Miller business is disclosed in the 2003 numbers as an additional segment, namely North America.
Future UK accounting developments The full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement benets has been delayed.
The disclosures as required by FRS 17 in the current year, which give an indication of the possible impact on the financial statements when fully implemented, are set out in note 34.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of the subsidiary and associated undertakings of the relevant businesses owned by SABMiller plc, as outlined in note 1.
The results of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired are included in the consolidated profit and loss account up to, or from, the date control passed or in the case of associated undertakings, the date significant inuence ceased or commenced.
Details of the principal subsidiary and associated undertakings are given on pages 119 to 123.
Where the groups interest in subsidiary undertakings is less than 100%, the share attributable to outside shareholders is reected in minority interests.
Some of the SABMiller businesses have a local statutory accounting reference date of 31 December, but since 31 March 1999 these have been consolidated in the financial statements on a basis coterminous with the groups accounting reference date.
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 65 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued In addition, the associated undertaking, Distell Group Ltd, has a statutory accounting reference date of 30 June.
In respect of the year ended 31 March 2003, this company has been included based on financial statements drawn up to 31 December 2002, but taking into account any changes in the subsequent period from 1 January 2003 to 31 March 2003 that would materially affect the results.
Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identiable separable assets and liabilities acquired.
Fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined by reference to market values, where available, or by reference to the current price at which similar assets could be acquired or similar obligations entered into, or by discounting expected future cash ows to present value, using either market rates or the risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash ows.
Where the fair value of the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identiable separable assets and liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Where the fair value of the separable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration given, the difference is treated as negative goodwill.
Both purchased and negative goodwill are accounted for as indicated below.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging or crediting the gross amount of any related goodwill to the extent that it has not previously been taken to the consolidated profit and loss account.
Associated undertakings An associated undertaking is an entity, other than a subsidiary undertaking, in which the group has a long-term interest of not less than 20% and in respect of which the group exercises a significant inuence over the operational and financial policies.
The results of associated undertakings have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associated undertaking is accounted for as indicated below.
Goodwill The consolidated financial statements adopt the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets which was effective for financial accounting periods ending on or after 23 December 1998.
Prior to 31 March 1998, purchased and negative goodwill was set off directly against shareholders funds in the acquisition period.
This adjustment will be charged or credited in the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the businesses to which they relate.
In respect of years subsequent to 31 March 1998, the purchased goodwill that arose has been capitalised.
The Companies Act, 1985, requires that capitalised goodwill be subject, normally, to systematic amortisation.
In the case of goodwill which is regarded as having a limited useful economic life, the groups accounting policy is to amortise the goodwill through the consolidated profit and loss account over the directors estimate of the useful life, being 20 years for the goodwill that has arisen to date.
The directors assessment of the useful life of this goodwill is based on the nature of the business acquired, the durability of the products to which the goodwill attaches and the expected future impact of competition on the business.
Where goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite useful life, the directors believe that the policy of not providing amortisation, until any permanent impairment is identied, is necessary in order that the consolidated financial statements show a true and fair view.
The directors undertake an annual impairment review of the carrying value and useful economic life of such goodwill and any amortisation or provision for permanent impairment would be charged against the profit for the period in which the impairment arose.
Goodwill previously written off against shareholders funds is not subjected to an annual impairment review and any impairment arising would therefore only be recognised upon disposal of the undertaking which originally gave rise to such goodwill.
66 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Trademarks The fair value of businesses acquired includes trademarks which are recognised in the balance sheet where the trademark has a value which is long-term.
Acquired trademarks are only recognised where title is clear, the trademark could be sold separately from the rest of the business and the earnings attributable to it are separately identiable.
Where the acquired trademark is seen as having a nite useful economic life, it is subject to amortisation, which in respect of trademarks currently held is ten years, being the period for which the group has exclusive rights to those trademarks.
Turnover Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties.
It includes excise duties and taxes levied on casino winnings but excludes value added tax.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, and net realisable value, as follows: Raw materials, consumables and goods for resale: Purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis FIFO.
Finished goods and work in progress: Raw material cost plus direct costs and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
Tangible xed assets and depreciation Land and buildings, which have been adapted to specialised functions, are recorded at historical cost.
All other land and buildings, which are used for general purposes, were previously revalued every three years on the basis of open market value for existing use by recognised professional valuers.
On adoption of FRS 15 Tangible xed assets in a prior year, the group resolved to retain the book value of land and buildings which were revalued at 1 April 1998, but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future.
These values are retained subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill.
All buildings are depreciated as indicated below.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
In respect of all other tangible xed assets depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less the estimated residual value of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 20 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant, vehicles and systems 2 30 years Containers, including returnable bottles 1 10 years The group regularly reviews its depreciation rates to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
profit or loss on the sale of an asset is the difference between the disposal proceeds and the net book value, including any revaluation, of the asset.
Any amount in the revaluation reserve relating to such an asset is transferred directly to shareholders funds and is not included in the profit for the financial year.
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 67 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Impairment In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill xed assets are subject to an impairment review if circumstances or events change to indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
The review is performed by comparing the carrying value of the xed asset to its recoverable amount, being the higher of the net realisable value and value in use.
The net realisable value is considered to be the amount that could be obtained on disposal of the asset.
The value in use of the asset is determined by discounting, at a market based pre-tax discount rate, the expected future cash ows resulting from its continued use, including those arising from its final disposal.
When the carrying values of xed assets are written down by any impairment amount, the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which incurred.
Should circumstances or events change and give rise to a reversal of a previous impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it occurs and the carrying value of the asset is increased.
The increase in the carrying value of the asset will only be up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, income producing units are considered to be groups of assets and liabilities that generate income, and are largely independent of other income streams.
They also include those assets and liabilities directly involved in producing the income and a suitable proportion of those used to produce more than one income stream.
Investments Fixed asset investments, other than subsidiary and associated undertakings, are stated individually at the lower of cost and their recoverable amount which is determined as the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Current asset investments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining net realisable values, market values are used in the case of listed investments and directors estimates used in the case of unlisted investments.
Capitalisation of interest and other costs Financing costs and certain direct costs incurred, before tax, on major capital projects during the period of development or construction are capitalised up to the time of completion of the project.
Deposits by customers Bottles and containers in circulation are recorded within xed assets and a corresponding liability is recorded in respect of the obligation to repay the customers deposits.
Deposits paid by customers for branded returnable bottles and containers are reected in the balance sheet under creditors due within one year.
Any estimated liability that is anticipated may arise in respect of deposits for unbranded containers and bottles is shown in provisions for liabilities and charges.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
68 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The financial statements denominated in US dollars have been prepared on the basis that transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in US dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate where the transaction is covered by a forward foreign exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the consolidated profit and loss account with the exception of differences on long-term foreign currency instruments, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, in which case they are taken directly to shareholders funds together with any exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related asset.
The profit and loss accounts and cash ow statements of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the relevant reporting period, other than material exceptional items which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction and assets including goodwill and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the relevant balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of opening net assets together with differences between profit and loss accounts translated at average and closing rates, are shown as a movement in shareholders funds and in the consolidated statements of total recognised gains and losses.
Leasing commitments Assets held under finance leases which result in group companies receiving substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are capitalised as tangible xed assets and depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital element of future obligations under the leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet classied, as appropriate, as a creditor due within or after one year.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account over the period of the lease term to reect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each financial year.
Rentals paid on operating leases are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions A number of dened contribution and dened benefit pension schemes are operated by the group in accordance with local regulations.
The assets of each scheme are held separately from those of the group and are administered by trustees.
Contributions to the dened benefit schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives.
The regular cost is attributed to individual years using the projected unit credit method.
Variations in pension cost, which are identied as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees in proportion to their expected payroll costs.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the consolidated profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Contributions to dened contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
Post-retirement medical benets Certain group companies provide post-retirement medical benets to qualifying employees.
The expected costs of these benets are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries and contributions are made to the relevant funds over the expected service lives of the employees entitled to those funds.
The estimated cost of providing such benets is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the employees working lives within the group.
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 69 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Capital instruments Capital instruments, other than equity shares, are classied as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benets and otherwise are included in shareholders funds.
The finance costs recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares are allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Provisions A provision is recognised when there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments Financial assets are recognised when the group has rights or other access to economic benets.
Such assets consist of cash, equity instruments, a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset, or a contractual right to exchange financial instruments with another entity on potentially favourable terms.
Financial liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation to transfer benets and that obligation is a contractual liability to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial instruments with another entity on potentially unfavourable terms.
When these criteria no longer apply, a financial asset or liability is no longer recognised.
If a legally enforceable right exists to set off recognised amounts of financial assets and liabilities, which are in determinable monetary amounts, and the group intends to settle on a net basis, the relevant financial assets and liabilities are offset.
Interest costs are charged against income in the year in which they are incurred.
Premiums or discounts arising from the difference between the net proceeds of financial instruments purchased or issued and the amounts receivable or repayable at maturity are taken to net interest payable over the life of the instrument.
Where the fair value of an asset falls below its carrying value, any difference is, in the case of xed assets, provided for if it is regarded that impairment exists.
In the case of current assets, provision is only made to the extent that it is considered as resulting in a lower net realisable value.
Derivative financial instruments The derivative instruments used by the group, which are used solely for hedging purposes i. e. to offset foreign exchange and interest rate risks, comprise interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Such derivative instruments are used to alter the risk prole of an existing underlying exposure of the group in line with the groups risk management policies.
Interest rate differentials under swap arrangements and forward rate agreements used to manage interest rate exposures are recognised by adjustment to net interest payable.
Premiums or discounts arising on the purchase of derivative instruments are amortised over the shorter of the life of the instrument and the underlying exposure.
Currency swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at closing rates of exchange.
Resulting gains and losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related borrowings or, where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs and shown within debtors or creditors as appropriate.
Where the instrument ceases to meet the criteria of being a hedge transaction or the underlying exposure which it is hedging is sold, matures, or is extinguished, then the instrument is valued at the appropriate market rate, after having taken account of selling costs.
Any resultant gains and losses are reected in operating income in the consolidated profit and loss account.
A similar treatment is applied where the hedge is of a future transaction and that transaction is no longer likely to occur.

Total brewery closure costs amount to US$35 million and include the impairment of the tangible xed assets to net recoverable value US$20 million and rationalisation costs, including redundancy and associated closure costs US$15 million.
The amalgamation of Miller Brewing Company with the rest of the groups business has given rise to integration costs amounting to US$23 million.
These costs include consultancy fees, ofce closure costs and expenses related to the reorganisation of the Miller and Pilsner Urquell international businesses, including severance costs and international brand realignment costs.
Following the groups acquisition of brewing and soft drink bottling interests in Central America towards the end of 2001, US$12 million of reorganisation costs have been incurred.
These consist of retrenchment costs US$6 million, consultancy fees US$3 million and other associated costs US$3 million.
Following SABMillers acquisition of Bere Timisoreana, an operating review resulted in management announcing, in March 2002, the rationalisation of the Pitesti brewery and a fair value adjustment impairment of the Ursus brewery, ahead of merging the two legal entities.
Closure costs and asset impairment totalled US$19 million.
In 2002, the PU group Czech reversed an impairment provision of US$11 million in respect of Velke Popovice, made at the date of acquisition.
The reversal was occasioned by more resilient than expected volumes, and therefore improved capacity utilisation at the brewery following national integration of the three subsidiaries in the country.

Effectively, the transaction has reduced the groups holdings in the Hotels division from 100% to 49%, and in the Gaming division from 50% to 49%.
The groups investment in TSH is being equity accounted.
The partial disposal of the Hotel and Gaming interests has resulted in a gain of US$12 million, which consists of profit on the transaction, after taking into account costs of disposal.
In addition, goodwill of US$8 million which had been written off against reserves has been taken into account.

The acquisition of Miller Brewing Company resulted in US$4,673 million goodwill and other acquisitions within Europe, Central America and Africa and Asia added a further US$60 million.
Goodwill arising from the acquisitions is being amortised over 20 years, with the exception of purchased goodwill in ABI, which the directors believe has an indefinite life.
This is consistent with the treatment of goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Suncrush, which was acquired by ABI on 8 June 1998.
The directors consider the goodwill to be supported by the existence of bottlers agreements with Coca-Cola Southern Africa Proprietary Limited CCSA.
ABI has similar bottlers agreements in respect of other regions within South Africa.
These bottlers agreements, which are based on the Coca-Cola system, establish performance obligations as to production, distribution and marketing arrangements to maximise long-term growth in volume, cash ow and shareholder value of the bottler company.
The Coca-Cola system came into being during 1899 and has had a consistent history of growth and success since that date.
The Suncrush agreements with CCSA were established in 1955 and have been in place since then.
The current agreements are for a period of ten years, with an extension of five years, expiring on 30 September 2007 and contain provisions for renewal at no cost.
ABI has had similar agreements since 1976 and they have always been renewed prior to expiry.
In the view of the directors, the bottlers agreements reect a long and ongoing relationship between the respective managements of ABI and CCSA.
80 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued The directors have given due consideration to financial forecasts in respect of the ABI business, the history of dealings of ABI with CCSA and the established international practice of The Coca-Cola Company in relation to its bottlers agreements.
In light of the above factors, the directors believe that the Suncrush agreements will continue to be renewed at the end of their legal expiry dates and the commercial value of the Coca-Cola product will be maintained.
Accordingly, the directors are of the view that the goodwill of US$238 million 2002: US$165 million, as underpinned by the bottlers agreements, currently has an indefinite economic life.
The directors have performed a review for impairment at 31 March 2003 and are of the opinion that no provision is required.
The amount of cumulative goodwill in respect of purchased subsidiary and associated undertakings which has been set off against shareholders funds prior to 31 March 1998 was US$167 million at 31 March 2003 2002: US$151 million, after resurrecting goodwill amounting to US$8 million on the partial disposal of the groups interests in the Hotels and Gaming division.

During the year ended 31 March 2002, US$5 million was further utilised in regard to the disposal of SAB Ltds remaining retail interests.
The residual US$20 million relates mainly to the disposal of OK Bazaars 1929 Ltd to Shoprite Holdings Ltd Shoprite.
As disclosed in previous annual reports, a number of claims were made by Shoprite in relation to the valuation of the net assets of OK Bazaars at the time of the sale and for alleged breaches by SAB Ltd of warranties contained in the sale agreements.
These claims are being contested by SAB Ltd and have been submitted for dispute resolution to independent accountants acting as experts and not as arbitrators.
In March 2000 an opinion was received from the experts but subsequent to that Shoprite has instituted action against the independent experts and SABMiller indicating an intention to refute the expert opinion.
While full provision for all claims has already been made on the basis of prudence, the actual outcome of the dispute cannot be estimated by the directors at this time.
The further information ordinarily required by FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets has not been disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the dispute.
Post-retirement benets The provision for post-retirement benets represents the provision for medical benets for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa, for post-retirement medical and life insurance benets to eligible employees and their dependants in North America, and pension provisions for employees in North and Central America, South Africa, Europe and Africa and Asia.
The principal assumptions on which these provisions are based are disclosed in note 34.
Insurance Insurance provisions of US$35 million represent amounts provided in respect of claims made by employees for workrelated accidents.
Management estimates that the provision will be substantially utilised in the next one to two years.

Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Other provisions At 31 March 2003 the group retained US$60 million 2002: US$30 million of other provisions.
The principal individual components of this amount are as follows: The group has provided for brewery closure costs in Tumwater USA totalling US$15 million.
The group has recognised various provisions, totalling US$11 million at 31 March 2003 2002: US$7 million, in relation to taxation exposures it believes may arise.
The provisions principally relate to corporate taxation in respect of a number of group companies and are not individually significant.
Any settlement in respect of these amounts will occur as and when the assessments are nalised with the respective tax authorities.
US$8 million 2002: US$7 million of provisions in respect of outstanding litigation within various operations have been retained, none of which are expected to have adverse material consequences to the group.
Payroll related provisions of US$8 million 2002: US$10 million include provisions amounting to US$8 million 2002: US$4 million within Central America to comply with labour legislation relating to employee service terminations and rewards.

Financial instruments The group purchases or issues financial instruments in order to finance its operations and to manage the interest rate and currency risks that arise from those operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial balances, for example trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments, arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations through a mixture of retained reserves, bank revolving credit borrowings, long-term bank loans and corporate bonds.
In respect of its South African businesses, the group manages overnight cash ows centrally through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sabn Pty Ltd.
Long-term bank nancing is arranged locally by the South African entities.
Project finance and term borrowing are negotiated directly with the banking industry by group operating subsidiaries, but subject to internal group treasury policies.
Outside South Africa, the groups treasury is managed by SABMiller Finance BV which is responsible for cash, the central borrowing portfolio, and foreign exchange management for the non South African businesses.
The group also enters into derivatives transactions, principally forward foreign currency contracts, forward rate agreements and interest rate swaps in order to manage the currency and interest rate risk arising from the groups operations.
The group does not write interest rate or currency options and currency options are only purchased as a cost-effective alternative to forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is group policy that no trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Compliance with the groups policies and exposure limits is reviewed at quarterly meetings of the board of directors.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year ended 31 March 2003.
Interest rate risk The group nances its operations through a mixture of retained reserves, bank and corporate bond borrowings.
The group borrows principally in rand, Polish zloty, Czech krone and in US dollars at both xed and oating rates of interest.
The interest rate characteristics of new borrowings and the renancing of existing borrowings are positioned according to expected movements in interest rates.
In order to hedge specic exposures in the interest rate repricing prole of existing borrowings and anticipated peak additional borrowings the group makes use of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest prole and to manage the groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
The groups policy is to maintain a level of xed rate borrowings measured on a rolling basis intended to limit the impact of a 1% change in interest rates to 1% of group operating profit excluding exceptional items.
As at 31 March 2003 32% 2002: 71% of the groups borrowings were at xed rates after taking account of any interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The changes in the xed rate percentage between the two years is analysed further in this note under the interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities and financial assets.
Liquidity risk In order to mitigate any liquidity risk that the group may face, the groups policy has been, throughout the year ended 31 March 2003, to maintain substantial unutilised banking facilities and reserve borrowings capacity, as indicated by the level of undrawn facilities.
Foreign currency risk The group seeks to mitigate the effect of structural currency exposures by borrowing, where cost effective, in the same currencies as the functional currencies of its main operating units.
It is not the groups policy to hedge foreign currency translation exposures.
The group also has transactional currency exposures which principally arise from sales or purchases, in currencies other than the units functional currency.
The groups policy is to limit the aggregate uncovered net transaction exposure to US$60 million 2002: US$80 million being intended to limit the impact on group operating profit to 1% for every 10% movement in exchange rates against the US dollar.
The actual position as at 31 March 2003 was US$14 million 2002: US$30 million.

Interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities and financial assets After taking into account the groups interest rate and currency swaps and forward rate agreements the currency and interest rate exposures of the borrowings of the group as at 31 March 2003 were: Financial Floating liabilities rate Fixed rate where no financial financial interest is liabilities liabilities Total paid Currency US$m US$m US$m US$m SA rand 92 64 156 US dollars 168 926 1,094 Central European currencies 99 98 197 Euro 16 16 Other currencies 68 4 72 At 31 March 2002 443 1,092 1,535 SA rand 13 78 91 US dollars 2,148 933 3,081 11 Central European currencies 142 117 259 Euro 22 22 2 Other currencies 67 1 68 At 31 March 2003 2,392 1,129 3,521 13 Based on the above oating rate borrowings at 31 March 2003, a 1% change in interest rates would impact group pre-tax profits, over a 12 month period, by approximately US$24 million, which is 3% of group operating profit.
Debt of US$2 billion at Miller Brewing Company is intended to be renanced with xed rate debt early in the next financial year repositioning interest rate variability within the policy of 1% of group operating profit.
The percentage of xed rate borrowings at 31 March 2003 was 32% 2002: 71%.

Financial instruments continued Floating rate borrowings are mainly bank sourced and bear interest at various money market rates which include overnight call, and up to the 12 month term rates in respect of SA rand activities.
US dollar oating rate borrowings are xed in advance for periods ranging from 30 to 180 days and are mainly priced by reference to LIBOR.
Central European borrowing rates vary signicantly between the various functional currency areas comprising this region, but are priced by reference to a combination of local market rates or LIBOR depending on the practice of the various markets.
The group held the following financial assets, as part of the nancing arrangements of the group as at 31 March 2003: 2003 2002 US$m US$m SA rand short-term deposits 1 1 US dollar short-term deposits 43 Other short-term deposits 1 1 SA rand cash 97 78 US dollar cash 349 81 Other cash 113 86 561 290 The above financial assets are all priced at oating rates with interest rates reset and or maturity dates within one year.
Rand assets attract interest rates at the overnight money market call rate, and US dollar assets attract LIBOR related interest rates at various margins.
Other currencies include those of Central European countries and the African continent.
Rand cash and short-term deposits are subject to South African exchange control regulations.
South Africas exchange control regulations provide for restrictions on exporting capital from South Africa, other than normal dividends.
Undrawn borrowing facilities The group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to it: Expiring Expiring between Expiring within one and in more than one year two years two years Total US$m US$m US$m US$m Group Central Treasury 25 600 625 Africa and Asia 55 2 57 Europe 35 76 58 169 Americas 40 10 50 South Africa 206 18 224 At 31 March 2002 361 676 88 1,125 Group Central Treasury 700 700 Africa and Asia 46 46 Europe 254 4 98 356 Americas 69 2 71 South Africa 417 417 At 31 March 2003 786 704 100 1,590 The facilities expiring within one year are of a general banking nature and thus subject to review at various dates usually on an annual basis, and it is expected that this prole will continue relative to core working capital and seasonal peak borrowing requirements.
The facilities expiring beyond two years are of a project and structured finance nature, and mostly are utilised to finance capital expenditure.
106 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 30.
Financial instruments continued Currency exposures The group seeks to mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments by borrowing as far as possible in the same currencies as the operating currencies of its main operating units.
Gains and losses arising on net investments and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
The table below shows the groups transactional or non-structural currency exposures that could give rise to net currency gains and losses which are recognised in the profit and loss account.

Certain subsidiaries have open forward contracts to manage short-term foreign currency exposures to expected future trade imports and exports.
These activities are predominantly centered in South Africa and take place between the SA rand, US dollar, and the euro.
Based on the above net transaction exposure position at 31 March 2003, a simultaneous 10% change in all foreign exchange rates against divisional reporting currencies would impact group operating profit by approximately US$1 million, which is well within the policy limit of 1% of group operating profit.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the groups financial instruments as at 31 March 2003.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The estimated net fair values have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, as detailed below, but are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the group could realise in the normal course of business.

Borrowings the fair values of the groups xed rate loans are estimated using quoted prices or, where such prices are not available, discounted cash ows analysed using the appropriate yield curve.
The book values of oating rate borrowings approximate their fair value.
Forward instruments the fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on discounted cash ow analysis and comprise contracts with xing dates after 31 March 2003.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are determined using the relevant market forward foreign exchange rates.
Hedging The groups policy is to hedge on a cost effective basis the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate derivatives: Currency transaction risk using forward foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency creditors.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used to hedge currency exposures on future expected transactions.
Under the groups accounting policy, foreign currency balances which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the relevant asset or liability effectively has the gain or loss on the hedging instrument embedded in its carrying value.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred until the underlying position matures: and Commodity price risk commodity contracts are purchased from time to time to hedge the underlying price risks inherent in the aluminium component of can purchases.

In addition, Miller has various long-term supply contracts with unrelated third parties to purchase certain materials used in its production and packaging process.
The terms of these contracts generally stipulate that Miller must use the designated suppliers for expected minimum percentages of its annual purchase requirements of the specified materials.
However, Miller is not obliged to make any purchases unless it requires supplies of such materials.

Staff loans and pension guarantees above primarily relate to the present value of Miller pension guarantees.
Miller and Pabst Brewing Company Pabst are responsible for the Milwaukee Brewery Workers Pension Plan.
In connection with Pabsts closure of its Milwaukee, Wisconsin brewery and their contract brewing agreement with Miller, Pabst entered into a withdrawal liability settlement agreement, which requires annual payments by Pabst to this pension plan of approximately US$4 million until 2013.
In the event that Pabst is unable to full its pension plan obligation, the plan would have recourse to all the assets of Pabst and its parent company.
If such assets do not satisfy Pabsts remaining pension obligation, Miller would be required to fund the remaining Pabst withdrawal liability until 2013.
SABMiller and Altria entered into a tax matters agreement the Agreement on 30 May 2002, to regulate the conduct of tax matters between them with regard to the acquisition of Miller and to allocate responsibility for contingent tax costs.
SABMiller has agreed to indemnify Altria against any taxes, losses, liabilities and costs that Altria incurs arising out of or in connection with a breach by SABMiller of any representation, agreement or covenant in the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
The company has a maximum exposure of US$1,000 million in respect of warranty claims under the Transaction Agreement with Altria excluding the indemnities given under the Agreement in respect of the purchase of Miller Brewing Company.
The group has exposures to various environmental risks.
Although it is difficult to predict the groups liability with respect to these risks, future payments, if any, would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material to the groups financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
110 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 33.
Contingent liabilities continued The group has a number of activities in a wide variety of geographic areas and is subject to certain legal claims incidental to its operations.
In the opinion of the directors, after taking appropriate legal advice, these claims are not expected to have, either individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect upon the groups financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
