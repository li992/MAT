Until conversion formally takes place by amendment of the Articles of Association the entitlements to dividends and voting rights are based on the underlying Dutch guilder amounts.
The 7%, 6% and 4% preference shares of NV are entitled to dividends at the rates indicated.
The 0.05 preference shares of NV are entitled to a dividend of 65% of the six months Euribor interest rate on their notional value of 6.580 each.
A nominal dividend of 14% is paid on the deferred stock of PLC.
The 4% cumulative preference capital of NV is redeemable at par at the companys option either wholly or in part.
NV has agreed that it will not buy back the 5 euro cents cumulative preference shares of the company before 9 June 2004.
At any time after this date, at NVs option, 6.534 of the notional value of the preference shares is convertible into ordinary NV shares and the remaining notional value is then redeemable.
NV expects to exercise the conversion right if any preference shares remain outstanding after 1 December 2004.
The other classes of preferential share capital of NV and the deferred stock of PLC are not redeemable.
