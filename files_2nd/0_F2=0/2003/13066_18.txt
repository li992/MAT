c Share-based remuneration The following unaudited disclosures are provided voluntarily in accordance with the proposals of FRED 31, Share Based Payment, to show the charge to the Groups profit and loss account in respect of share options if the proposals were adopted in these financial statements.
For completeness, the cost in respect of restricted shares, which has been charged to the profit and loss account in 2003, is also shown under a separate heading below.
In the period between 7 November 2002 the issue date of the exposure draft and 31 December 2003, the Company made grants under the following share-based payment arrangements: Share Options 1999 Share Option Plan UK SAYE US SAYE 2003 2004 2004 2004 Grant date 22 November 2002 8 December 2003 25 September 2003 8 December 2003 Scope Top 400 Management Top 400 Management All UK Staff All US Staff Exercise price 11.186 12.76 9.48 9.48 Contractual life years 10 10 3, 5 or 7 3, 5 or 7 Performance criteria EPS growth EPS growth None None Performance period 20032005 20042006 n a n a EPS growth required for vesting at: 40% 6% 6% n a n a 60% 7% 7% n a n a 80% 8% 8% n a n a 100% 9% 9% n a n a Black-Scholes model assumptions Share price on grant date 10.96 12.80 12.00 12.80 Volatility 27% 26% 26% 26% Dividend yield 2.24% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% Life years 5533 Risk-free interest rate 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% Basic fair value of one option 2.60 2.93 3.63 4.12 Adjustment factor 0.86 0.86 0.86 0.86 Adjusted fair value of option 2.24 2.52 3.12 3.54 Options outstanding at 1 January 2003 6,914,000 Granted 4,817,500 180,109 651,043 Lapsed 697,250 6,595 Options outstanding at 31 December 2003 6,216,750 4,817,500 180,109 644,448 Total fair value of grant m 15.5 12.1 0.6 2.3 Annual profit and loss account charge which would be applied over the performance period m 5.2 4.0 0.2 0.8 50 Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report 2003 4 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED c Share-based remuneration continued Fair value of options granted which would be charged in: 2004 2003 m m Grants during 2002 5.2 5.2 Grants during 2003 5.0 10.2 5.2 All grants are conditional on the employees remaining in the Group employment for three years from the date of grant.
The fair value of all options was measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model.
An adjustment factor of 0.86 was applied to take into account any outcome of the performance criteria of less than 100% and lapse of options over the performance period.
The expected volatility of 26% 2002 27% is based on the historical volatility over the previous 24 months.
The contractual life of the share options granted under the 1999 share option plan is ten years, but the Company expects that, once vested, five years is a more reasonable expected life.
The risk-free interest rate is equal to the yield on UK government bonds available at the grant date, with a term equal to the life of the options.
Restricted shares 1999 Restricted Share Plan The Company has issued a number of tranches of restricted shares to date.
These are treated as share options with a nil exercise price for accounting purposes.
Accordingly, under UITF 17, the intrinsic value at grant date is charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period.
The total charge to the profit and loss account in 2003 in respect of previous restricted share grants was 19m 2002 15m.
On 8 December 2003, the Company granted 2,410,750 restricted shares in total to approximately 400 employees at senior management level under the terms of the 1999 Restricted Share Plan.
None were forfeited or exercisable at 31 December 2003.
The fair value of the restricted shares is taken as the intrinsic value at the grant date, being 12.80.
The cost of this award, 31m, will be charged to the profit and loss account in accordance with UITF 17 over the performance period 2004 to 2006, equivalent to an annual charge of approximately 10m in those three years.
d Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world which are principally of the funded type.
The Groups two most significant defined benefit schemes are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The principal data for these schemes are as follows: UK US Date of last actuarial review 5 April 2001 1 January 2003 Valuation method used Projected unit Projected unit Amortisation method used Straight line Straight line Number of years over which surplus is spread 12 13 Market value of scheme assets 609m 97m Assumptions: Annual rate of return on investments discount rate 7.3% 6.5% Annual earnings increases 4.5% 5.0% Annual pensions increases 2.5% n a Annual dividend increases 3.5% n a Annual rate of inflation 2.5% 4.0% Level of funding 114% 85% The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account, calculated in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified independent actuaries, is made up as follows: UK US 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Regular cost 6 6 3 4 Variations from regular cost 4 4 3 Net pension cost 2 2 3 1 Debtors due after more than one year includes a prepayment of 55m 2002 57m in respect of the excess funding of the UK scheme and 8m 2002 5m in respect of other schemes.

In July 2003, holders of bonds amounting in value to 1,214,822 2002 244,043 exercised their right of conversion into 244,880 2002 49,168 ordinary shares of Reckitt Benckiser plc, giving a cumulative 9,100,318 of bonds which have now been converted into shares.
The terms of the issue, adjusted for the 1994 rights issue, allow the holders to convert the bonds into Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares on 31 July in each of the years 1993 to 2004 at the exchange price of 496p per share equivalent to 20.161 Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares per 100 bonds of 1 each.
Bondholders will also have the right at maturity to convert their bonds into Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares on similar terms as apply on each annual conversion opportunity.
Insofar as these rights are not exercised and if no other action is taken, the bonds outstanding at maturity currently 31 March 2005 will be converted into preference shares in Reckitt & Colman Capital Finance Limited and such preference shares will immediately be redeemed at 100p per bond.
Reckitt Benckiser plc may make arrangements for some or all of the ordinary shares which would otherwise arise on any conversion at maturity to be placed or purchased and for bondholders to receive out of the proceeds the same amount of cash as they would have received on a redemption of the underlying preference shares on the basis that Reckitt Benckiser plc shall bear any shortfall, but may retain any excess, in the actual proceeds of such placing or sale as compared to such redemption amount.
The trustee of the issue may also at maturity require all then outstanding bonds to be converted into Reckitt Benckiser ordinary shares and sold on behalf of bondholders if it is satisfied or advised that bondholders are likely to receive a greater cash amount on maturity as a result.
In accordance with the terms of the issue, Reckitt & Colman Capital Finance Limited may elect to give bondholders the option to extend the life of their bonds.
In addition, and if it so chooses, Reckitt & Colman Capital Finance Limited may, at the same time, make arrangements for the purchase by a third party of some or all of those bonds in respect of which such option is not exercised by bondholders on the basis that relevant bondholders would receive the same amount of cash as they would have done on redemption, with the issuer bearing any shortfall but retaining any excess.
Save in certain circumstances, Reckitt Benckiser plc also has the right to exchange all outstanding bonds for Reckitt Benckiser plc redeemable preference shares with similar terms as to redemption and conversion into Reckitt Benckiser plc ordinary shares as the bonds.

In December 2003, the Group acquired an additional 20% interest in Reckitt Benckiser Pakistan Limited, for consideration of 6m cash.
The reduction in minority interest was 1m, and the fair value of all assets and liabilities approximated to book value.

The above acquisitions were accounted for under acquisition accounting.
25 PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT The prior year adjustment relates to the implementation of FRS 5 Application Note G Revenue Recognition.
The adoption of FRS 5 Application Note G has resulted in a reduction in net revenues for 2002 of 77m, primarily due to the reclassification of coupons from a marketing expense within net operating expenses to a deduction from net revenues.
The following reconciliation shows the effect on the previously reported 2002 numbers and the 2003 numbers.
