2 Discontinued operations Discontinued operations disclosures in 2002 relate to the disposal of the general insurance businesses in Australia and New Zealand.
The results of all other operations are described as Continuing operations.
The Groups consolidated profit and loss account incorporates the following financial information in respect of the Australia and New Zealand general insurance businesses: Abridged statement of operating and investment gains 2003 2002 m m Net premiums written 692 Change in the provision for unearned premiums 38 Earned premiums, net of reinsurance 654 Allocated investment return transferred from the non-technical account 71 Claims incurred, net of reinsurance 452 Other charges 195 Balance on the general business technical account Underwriting result 7 Longer-term investment return 71 Operating profit 78 Amortisation of goodwill 2 Short-term fluctuation in investment returns and other items 40 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 36 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 6 Profit for the financial year 30 3 Changes in accounting policy a Additional value of internally-generated in-force business In November 2003, the Association of British Insurers issued a revised version of its Statement of Recommended Practice on accounting for insurance business ABI SORP.
One of the amendments is that insurance companies are no longer allowed to recognise the internally-generated additional value of in-force business AVIF on their balance sheets, either as an asset or as part of shareholders funds.
The Group has therefore changed its accounting policy in this area.
The effects of implementing this change are that equity shareholders funds at 31 December 2003 have been reduced by 4,611 million 2002: reduced by 3,832 million: 2001: reduced by 5,268 million and minority interests have been reduced by 133 million 2002: reduced by 85 million: 2001: reduced by 81 million.
b Presentation changes i In December 2003, the Urgent Issues Task Force issued UITF Abstract 38 which requires shares held by employee share trusts to be deducted from capital in arriving at shareholders funds rather than being held as assets.
The effects of implementing this change are that equity shareholders funds at 31 December 2003 have been reduced by 1 million 2002: reduced by 1 million: 2001: reduced by 10 million.
ii The Groups wealth management result was previously shown separately but is now shown as part of the result from non-insurance operations.
The result reclassified in 2003 is nil 2002: loss of 30 million.

In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.

20 Investments in joint ventures a As part of their investment strategy, the UK long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships PLPs through a mix of capital and loans.
The PLPs are managed by general partners GPs, in which the UK long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs.
Most of the PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios.
The lenders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both interest and principal, to the extent that there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any company in the Aviva Group.
Accounting for the PLPs as subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or other financial investments depends on the shareholdings in the GPs and the terms in each partnership agreement.
Where the Group exerts control over a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated.
Where the partnership is managed by a contractual agreement such that no one party exerts control, notwithstanding that the Groups partnership share in the PLP including its indirect stake via the relevant GP may be greater than 50%, such PLPs have been accounted for as joint ventures.
Here, the Groups share of the respective PLPs gross assets and gross liabilities are shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with the requirements of FRS9 Associates and joint ventures.
Where the Group holds minority stakes in PLPs, with no disproportionate influence, the relevant investments are included in other financial investments at their market value.

Aviva plc 83 Accounts and notes Notes to the accounts continued 23 Securitised mortgages and related assets Other financial investments include loans secured by mortgages, subject to non-recourse finance arrangements, in a UK long-term business subsidiary and in a Dutch subsidiary.
Details of the relevant transactions are as follows: a In a United Kingdom long-term business subsidiary, Norwich Union Equity Release Limited NUER, the beneficial interest in three portfolios of equity release mortgages has been transferred to three special purpose securitisation companies, Equity Release Funding No.
1 plc ERF1, Equity Release Funding No.
2 plc ERF2 and Equity Release Funding No.
3 plc ERF3 together the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the noteholders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments.
No gain or loss was recognised on the transfer to ERF1 and ERF3, and a gain of 5.2 million was recognised on the transfer to ERF2.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed rate, floating rate and index linked notes by the ERF companies.
The ultimate effective holding company of each of the ERF companies is Equity Release Funding Holdings Limited, whose shares are held on trust.
NUER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent company.
NUER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where NUER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
NUER has indemnified the ERF companies for any losses they may suffer should its customers set off any shortfall in their annuities purchased from another Aviva Group company against amounts they owe to the ERF companies, and any shortfall due to negative equity not insured elsewhere.
NUERs liability under these indemnities, estimated as 6 million 2002: 5 million, is included in other creditors in the consolidated balance sheet, whilst the linked liabilities figure has been reduced by the same amount to show the Groups net interest in these securitisations.
NUER has purchased 12.5 million of subordinated fixed rate notes in ERF1, which are repayable in 2031 and has granted a 14 million floating rate subordinated loan to ERF3.
These are included in debt securities and other fixed income securities within other financial investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
NUER receives payments from the ERF companies in respect of fees for loan administration and cash handling purposes.
Income of 3 million 2002: 2 million has been included in investment income, relating to the securitisation of the mortgage portfolios.
b In a Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering NV DLL, the principal benefits of four portfolios of mortgage loans have been transferred to four special purpose securitisation companies, Arena 2000-1 BV, Arena 2001-1 BV, Arena 2002-1 BV and Arena 2003-1 BV, the Arena companies, which were funded primarily through the issue of fixed rate notes.
No gains or losses were recognised on these transfers.
All the shares in the Arena companies are held by independent trustees, respectively Stichting Security Trustee Arena 2000-1 BV, Stichting Security Trustee Arena 2001-1 BV, Stichting Security Trustee Arena 2002-1 BV and Stichting Security Trustee Arena 2003-1 BV.
DLL does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the Arena companies or their parent companies.
DLL has no right, nor any obligation, to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where DLL is in breach of warranty.
At 31 December 2003, DLL held 23 million of fixed rate notes in the Arena companies, which are repayable at various dates between 2053 and 2062.
These are included in debt securities and other fixed income securities within other financial investments in the consolidated balance sheet at their market value of 24 million 2002: 5 million.
DLL received interest of 2 million in 2003 2002: 2 million on the loan notes it holds in the Arena companies.
It also receives payments under the terms of interest rate swaps written between DLL and these companies to hedge their respective exposures to movements in interest rates arising from these transactions.
In each case, the effect of the swaps is that the Arena companies convert all or part of the interest flows receivable from customers in respect of the securitised mortgage loans into fixed interest flows which are designed substantially to match the interest payable to the noteholders.
DLL has written further interest rate swaps with a bank to hedge its own interest rate risk under these contracts.
Included in investment income is 25 million 2002: 7 million relating to these swaps.
c In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that noteholders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that noteholders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.
Total mortgage assets and non-recourse funding in the above quasi-subsidiaries at 31 December 2003 were 3,149 million 2002: 2,104 million and 3,143 million 2002: 2,099 million respectively.
As permitted by FRS5 Reporting the substance of transactions, these balances are accounted for in the consolidated Group balance sheet using a linked presentation.
Interest receivable and payable on the above items in 2003 totalled 195 million 2002: 121 million and 166 million 2002: 106 million respectively.
Apart from the administration fees payable to other Group undertakings, described above, there are no other material profit and loss items in these companies.
The majority of the securitisations relate to long-term business.
Cash inflows from non-recourse funding on non-long-term business were 478 million in 2003 2002: 219 million.

37 Long-term business a The Group underwrites long-term business in a number of countries as follows: i In the United Kingdom mainly in with-profit funds of CGNU Life, Commercial Union Life, Norwich Union Life & Pensions and the Provident Mutual fund, where the with-profits policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance: non-profit funds of Norwich Union Annuity, Norwich Union Life & Pensions and Norwich Union Linked Life, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by Norwich Union Life & Pensions and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
ii In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
iii In the Netherlands, where the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits which are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
iv In other overseas operations, using methods similar to those described above.
b The directors have been advised by the Groups reporting actuary that the assets of each of the long-term operations were at least sufficient to meet their respective liabilities at 31 December 2003.
Aviva plc 89 Accounts and notes Notes to the accounts continued 38 Long-term business provision a Methodology There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
b Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where there is discretion over these.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whilst those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision, as detailed in note 8.
The principal assumptions in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands are: i United Kingdom The net premium method is used for most contracts except term assurances in the Norwich Union Life & Pensions and Norwich Union Linked Life funds, business in the with-profit funds of CGNU Life and Commercial Union Life, and non-profit deferred annuity and with-profit business in the Provident Mutual Fund.
For term assurances in the Norwich Union Life & Pensions and Norwich Union Linked Life funds, business in the with-profit funds of CGNU Life and Commercial Union Life, and non-profit deferred annuity and with-profit business in the Provident Mutual Fund, the provisions are valued using the gross premium method.
All contracts are assumed to continue for the contractual term and, for consistency with the discount rates, no future regular bonuses are assumed to be added to with-profit business.
For unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued initially by determining the lower of the current non-guaranteed surrender value and the bid value of units.
This result is then compared with a prospective valuation and the higher result is taken.
The prospective valuation projects future benefits on the assumption that future premiums cease and regular bonuses are decreased to the guaranteed rate or nil, at a rate consistent with policyholder reasonable expectations.
Allowance for persistency is based on actual experience and takes into account the likelihood of a significantly greater lapse experience on those occasions on which the life company guarantees not to apply a Market Value Reduction charge.
For unit-linked business, the provisions are valued initially by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cashflows on the assumption that future premiums cease.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The changes in the valuation discount rates since 2002 reflect the changes in the yields on the supporting assets.

ii France The majority of provisions arise from a single premium savings product and are based on the accumulated fund value, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
There have been no changes in the assumptions since 2002.

The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
39 Provisions for outstanding claims a The ultimate cost of general business outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
Such methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred claims, average costs per claim and ultimate claim numbers for each accident year, based upon the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that past claims development experience can be used to project ultimate claims costs.
Judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, for example to reflect public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions or varying levels of claims inflation.
The approach adopted takes into account, inter alia, the nature and materiality of the business and the type of data available.
Large claims are usually separately assessed, either by being measured at case estimate face value or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
Additional qualitative input, such as allowance for one-off occurrences or changes in legislation, policy conditions or portfolio mix, is also used in arriving at the estimated ultimate cost of claims, in order that it represents the most likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
Provisions are calculated allowing for reinsurance recoveries and a separate asset is recorded for the reinsurers share, having regard to collectability.

The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims and related reinsurance recoveries.
40 Equalisation provision An equalisation provision has been established in the Group accounts as explained in accounting policy T on page 58.
This had the effect of reducing Group and Company shareholders funds by 364 million at the year end 2002: 314 million.
The change in the equalisation provision during the year comprised a reduction of 49 million 2002: 57 million in the balance on the general business technical account and the profit on ordinary activities before tax.
In 2002, the reduction of 57 million included a partial offset of 15 million representing the equalisation provision of a subsidiary company sold during that year.

The only material defined benefit schemes are in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the United Kingdom scheme is by far the largest.
The assets of the main United Kingdom, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds and, in the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
An actuarial report has been submitted for each of the defined benefit schemes within the last three years, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
The substantial falls in stock markets worldwide over the last few years have affected the funding position of the schemes.
In the United Kingdom scheme, the employing companies have agreed to pay additional contributions.
b The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 and the disclosures given in section c below are those required by that accounting standard.
FRS17 Retirement Benefits was issued in November 2000 and differs from SSAP24 in a number of ways.
These are principally in the choice of assumptions, and that the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities is immediately recognised in the balance sheet under FRS17, whereas changes in assets and liabilities are recognised on a smoothed basis under SSAP24.
The accounting provisions of FRS17 were not expected to be mandatory for the Group until the year ending 31 December 2003 but, in the transitional period, certain disclosures were required in the notes to the accounts.
In November 2002, the Accounting Standards Board issued an amendment to FRS17 which extended the transitional period through to, in the Groups case, the year ending 31 December 2005.
The transitional disclosures, to the extent not given in section c, are set out in section e below.
c In the United Kingdom, the Group operates one main pension scheme, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme.
New entrants join the defined contribution section of the scheme, as the defined benefit section is generally closed to most new employees.
The scheme was valued as at an effective date of 1 April 2002, on a market value basis using the Projected Unit Method.
The main financial assumptions used were a pension increase rate of 2.5%, a salary increase rate of 4.25% and an interest rate of 6.4%.
The scheme had an asset value of 4,639 million, projected accrued liabilities of 4,010 million and a funding level of 116%.
The employer cost of future service benefits in respect of defined benefit members for 2003 was 21.2% of pensionable salaries which, after allowing for interest on the prepayment held in the balance sheet and the additional surplus since, led to a net pension cost for the period to 31 December 2003 of 8.6% of pensionable salaries.
The pension cost was then increased to allow for the amounts credited to members accounts under the defined contribution section of the scheme.
The employing companies contributions to the defined benefit section of the scheme throughout 2003 were 25% of employees pensionable salaries and, for members of the defined contribution section, were 8% of pensionable salaries together with further contributions up to 4% where members contribute and the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
The employers contribution rate for 2004 for members of the defined benefit section have been maintained at 25% of pensionable salaries together with an additional payment of 50 million, while the contribution rates for members of the defined contribution section are the same as for 2003.
In the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland, regular actuarial valuations of the main schemes are made in accordance with local funding and or accounting standards.
Total pension costs for the schemes in these countries have been taken as equal to the locally determined accounting costs or contributions paid to the plans as, at a Group level, these are not considered to be materially different from charges calculated under a detailed application of SSAP24.
The Group also operates a variety of smaller pension arrangements in these and other countries, where costs have also been based on those calculated locally.
d The pension costs of the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2003 2002 m m UK defined benefit schemes 39 50 UK defined contribution schemes 34 27 Overseas defined benefit schemes 33 34 Overseas defined contribution schemes 10 6 116 117 There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2003 or 2002. e FRS17 defined benefit plan disclosures i The valuation used for FRS17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the requirements of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the major schemes at 31 December 2003.
The updating was made by actuaries in each country, with overall co-ordination by external consultants, Watson Wyatt.
Other than the actuary of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, the actuaries making the calculation were independent of the Group.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31 December 2003.
The details for the main defined benefit schemes are shown below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.

In the United Kingdom, the value of the liabilities has increased due to lower corporate bond yields, which are used to set the valuation discount rate, and a higher assumed inflation rate.
The increase in asset values is primarily due to a strong improvement in equity values since the previous year end.
vii The effect on the Groups net assets and retained profits at 31 December 2003 of substituting the FRS17 figures for the corresponding SSAP24 balance sheet entries would be as follows: Net assets Profit and loss account reserve Restated 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Totals included in the Group accounts 7,365 6,494 1,932 1,126 Less: pension asset on SSAP24 basis 251 175 251 175 Totals excluding pension asset 7,114 6,319 1,681 951 Less: pension liability on FRS17 basis 583 456 583 456 Totals including pension liability on FRS17 basis 6,531 5,863 1,098 495 46 Assets under management The total Group assets under management are: Restated 2003 2002 m m Total assets included in the balance sheet 208,680 181,005 Additional value of internally-generated in-force long-term business 4,744 3,917 Third party funds under management Securitised mortgages gross of non-recourse funding 3,143 2,099 Unit trusts, Oeics, Peps and Isas 4,460 3,636 Segregated funds 19,355 16,955 Total assets under management 240,382 207,612 47 Cash flow statement The cash flow statement reflects long-term business activities only to the extent that cash is transferred between long-term and non-long-term operations.

Note 39 gives details of the estimation techniques used in determining the general business outstanding claims provision.
Both are estimated to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed for long-term business, or assumptions over general business claims inflation may alter in the future, there is uncertainty in respect of this liability.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Aviva Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and South Africa.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, the Groups exposure to such liabilities is not significant and, on the basis of current information and having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
In the United Kingdom, in common with other pension and life policy providers, the Group wrote individual and group pension policies in the 1970s and 1980s with a guaranteed annuity rate option GAO.
Since 1993, such policies have become more valuable to policyholders, and more costly for insurers, as current annuity rates have fallen in line with interest rates.
Reserving policies for the cost of GAOs varied until a ruling by the House of Lords in the Equitable Life case in 2000 which effectively required full reserving by all companies.
Prior to the ruling, consistent with the Groups ordinary reserving practice in respect of such obligations, full reserves for GAOs had already been established.
No adjustment was made, or was necessary, to the Groups reserving practice as a result of the ruling.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions are sufficient.
d Pensions mis-selling The Pensions Review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA, has largely been completed.
A provision of some 65 million 2002: 68 million remains to meet the outstanding costs of the few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS.
The provision reflects the significant increases in levies expected over the next two to three years, as advised by the FSCS.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
Aviva plc 99 Accounts and notes Notes to the accounts continued 48 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued e Endowment reviews In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.
A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least as well as they would have done without an endowment.
Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Groups UK mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specific letters advising them whether their investment was on track to cover their mortgage.
In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity.
The Group will continue to send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment holders, in accordance with FSA requirements.
The Group has made provisions totalling 80 million 2002: 50 million to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups liability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
f Split capital investment trusts The Groups fund management subsidiary, Morley Fund Management Limited, acts as fund manager for a number of split capital investment trusts.
In May 2002, the FSA launched extensive and industry-wide investigations into allegations of collusion by fund managers, mis-selling by intermediaries, and the production and distribution of misleading marketing material.
In July 2003, the FSA announced that it had broadened the coverage of the collusion investigations to cover a larger number of firms and individuals.
As part of these investigations, Morley Fund Management Limited has been asked to supply information to the FSA.
These investigations are ongoing and are likely to continue for some time.
The FSA is expected to publish its findings in due course.
g Other The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain subsidiary and associated undertakings.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiary and associated undertakings to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
49 Capital commitments In carrying on the business of investment, the Group has entered into future commitments, including property development, after 31 December 2003.
These amounts are not reflected in the consolidated Group balance sheet on pages 64 and 65.
The Group has in hand a number of property developments which, under contracts already signed, will require expenditure of 181 million 2002: 344 million for long-term business operations.

Approved by the Board on 24 February 2004 Philip Twyman Group Executive Director Notes 1 The analysis between the Groups and the minority interest share of the additional value of internally-generated in-force long-term business is as follows: Movement in 2003 2002 the year m m m Groups share included in shareholders funds 4,611 3,832 779 Minority interest share 133 85 48 4,744 3,917 827 2 Analysis of net assets on an achieved profit basis is made up as follows: 2003 2002 m m Long-term business net assets on an achieved profit basis 12,373 10,379 Comprises: Embedded value of life operations 12,155 10,148 RBSG goodwill 218 231 Aviva plc 104 Alternative method of reporting Basis of preparation achieved profit basis The achieved profit statement includes the results of the Groups life operations reported under the achieved profit basis combined with the modified statutory basis results of the Groups non-life operations set out on pages 56 to 100.
In the directors opinion, the achieved profit basis provides a more accurate reflection of the performance of the Groups life operations year on year than results under the modified statutory basis.
The achieved profit methodology used is in accordance with the guidance on Supplementary reporting for long-term insurance business the achieved profit method circulated by the Association of British Insurers in December 2001.
Further details on the methodology and assumptions are set out on pages 107 to 109.
The results of the Groups life operations under the modified statutory basis, which is the basis used in the annual statutory accounts, can be found on pages 56 to 100.
The contribution from the Groups share of the alliance with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG is incorporated within the achieved operating profit.
Goodwill amortised in the year in respect of the Groups holding in the associated company, RBS Life Investments Limited, is included within the Amortisation of goodwill line in the Summarised consolidated profit and loss account.
The results for 2003 and 2002 have been audited by the auditors Ernst & Young LLP.
Their audit report in respect of 2003 is on page 110.
Components of total life achieved profit Total life achieved profit, including the Groups share from the alliance with RBSG, comprises the following components, the first three of which in aggregate are referred to as life achieved operating profit: new business contribution written during the period including value added between the point of sale and end of the period: the profit from existing business equal to: the expected return on the value of the in-force business at the beginning of the period, experience variances caused by the differences between the actual experience during the period and expected experience based on the operating assumptions used to calculate the start of year value, the impact of changes in operating assumptions including risk margins: the expected investment return on the shareholders net worth, based upon assumptions applying at the start of the year: investment return variances caused by differences between the actual return in the period and the expected experience based on economic assumptions used to calculate the start of year value: and the impact of changes in economic assumptions in the period.

The impact of this change was 24 million.
In 2002, operating assumptions included the impact of reducing risk margins in the US.
The impact of this change was 13 million.

The contribution generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after-tax distributable profit from that business.
Contribution before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution after-tax at the full corporation tax rate for UK business and at appropriate rates of tax for other countries.

New business contributions have been calculated using the same economic assumptions as those used to determine the embedded values as at the beginning of each year and operating assumptions used to determine the embedded values as at the end of the period.
The effect of solvency margin represents the impact of holding the minimum European Union EU solvency margin or equivalent for non-EU operations and discounting to present value the projected future releases from the solvency margin to shareholders.

The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the modified statutory basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Distributable profits from long-term businesses arise when they are released to shareholders following actuarial valuations.
These are carried out in accordance with statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality and administration costs.
Using realistic assumptions of future experience, we can project releases to shareholders arising in future years from the business in-force and associated minimum statutory solvency margin.
The life achieved profit reflects current performance by measuring the movement, from the beginning to the end of the year, in the present value of projected releases to shareholders from the business in-force and associated minimum statutory margin, together with the movement in the net assets of the long-term operations, adjusted for any amounts released from or invested in life operations.
The present value of the projected releases to shareholders is calculated by discounting back to the current time using a risk discount rate.
The risk discount rate is a combination of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from the assumptions referred to above.
Achieved profit reporting takes account of the cost of maintaining local provisions.
In addition, a significant allowance for the expected cost of guarantees is implicitly allowed for in the risk margin inherent in the risk discount rate consistent with the principles of the achieved profit guidance.
The calculations are carried out on an after-tax basis and the profits are then grossed up for tax at the full rate of corporation tax for the United Kingdom and at an appropriate rate for each of the other countries.
b Embedded value The shareholders interest in the long-term business operations is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net assets of the long-term operations and the present value at risk discount rates which incorporate a risk margin of the projected releases to shareholders arising from the business in-force, less a deduction for the effect of holding the minimum statutory solvency margin.
This effect of solvency margin is the difference between the nominal value of the solvency margin and the present value at risk discount rates of the projected release of the solvency margin and investment earnings on the assets deemed to back the solvency margin.
For with-profit funds in the United Kingdom and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the free assets over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
Aviva plc 107 Alternative method of reporting Alternative method of reporting long-term business continued Principal economic assumptions Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at each period end.
Margins are applied on a consistent basis to risk free yields to obtain investment return assumptions for ordinary shares and property, and risk discount rates.
The change in assumptions in 2003 reflects the movements in actual risk-free yields in each territory.
Risk margins remain unchanged in all of our key businesses, except Poland, the US and Australia.
The economic assumptions for the pension business are identical with the exception of the risk discount rate which is 12.7% 2002: 13.8%: 2001: 16.9%.
Aviva plc 108 Alternative method of reporting Other assumptions Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered, except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience.
The management expenses of Aviva attributable to long-term business operations have been split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business and to the maintenance of business in-force.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature have been identified separately and the discounted value of projected exceptional costs has been deducted from the value of in-force business.
A realistic estimate of future fund management expenses that will be charged to long-term businesses by Group companies not included in the longterm business covered by the achieved profits method has been included within the value of in-force business.
It has been assumed that there will be no changes to the methods and bases used to calculate the statutory technical provisions and current surrender values.
The value of in-force business allows for future premiums under recurring single premium business where collection of future single premiums is expected and where the receipt of further single premiums is not regarded as new business at the point of receipt.
It does not allow for future premiums under non-contractual increments, or for future Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate premiums, and the value arising therefrom is included in the value of new business when the premiums are received.
The value of the in-force business has been determined after allowing for the effect of holding solvency margins equal to the minimum EU solvency requirement or equivalent for non-EU operations.
Solvency margins relating to with-profit business are assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Bonus rates on with-profit business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions and Avivas medium-term bonus plans.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
Alternative assumptions Economic assumptions The table below shows the sensitivity to a one percentage point increase in the assumed investment returns for equity and property investments, and in the discount rate for the Groups 2003 new business contribution and embedded value.

The impact of an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate is calculated with all other assumptions remaining unchanged.
Non-economic assumptions Sensitivity calculations have been performed to identify the non-economic assumptions to which new business contribution and the value of in-force business within embedded value are particularly sensitive.
The calculations have been based on similar percentage movements in each assumption from the base assumption used to calculate the published new business contribution and value of in-force business.
Based on this, both the Groups new business contribution and value of in-force are most sensitive to changes in future maintenance expenses.

Shareholders who have not already joined the Plan and wish to do so should contact the Companys registrar at the address opposite to obtain full details and a mandate form.
Shareholders who have previously elected to join the Plan need take no further action.
At the Annual General Meeting the Board will be seeking authority to offer shareholders the choice of receiving scrip dividends as an alternative to cash dividends.
If this proposal is approved by shareholders and is introduced, it would replace the Companys current dividend reinvestment plan and accordingly the Company would write to all shareholders setting out full details of the scrip dividend scheme and its implications.
Dividend payments direct to your bank account If you wish, you can have your dividend payments credited directly into your bank or building society account on the dividend payment date.
For overseas shareholders the Company has introduced Transcontinental Account Payment Service TAPS which allows shareholders in many countries to have dividends credited direct to bank accounts in local currencies.
To obtain further details and a mandate form please contact the Companys registrar at the address opposite.
Consolidated tax vouchers For those shareholders who currently receive dividends paid directly into their bank building society account, it is now the Companys intention to issue one tax voucher each year instead of two.
This we hope will prove to be more convenient for shareholders and will also result in cost and environmental savings.
The new practice does not alter the dividend payments or when they are paid and will come into operation in the 2004 05 tax year.
You will not receive a tax voucher for the May and November 2004 dividends, you will instead receive a consolidated tax voucher relating to these payments in 2005.
The voucher will be issued prior to any tax return from the Inland Revenue.
Any shareholders who do not wish to receive this service and wish to continue to receive tax vouchers with each dividend may elect to do so by contacting the Companys registrar at the address opposite.
Please note that we are unable to offer the service to institutional shareholders or those participating in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
