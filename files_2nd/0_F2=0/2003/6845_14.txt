6 PENSIONS The company maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, a Greene King defined benefit scheme which closed to new entrants on 2 May 1997 and a Morland defined benefit scheme for former Morland employees which was closed to new entrants on 12 December 2000.
Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the groups finances and are administered by pension trustees.
An actuarial valuation of the Greene King defined benefit scheme was carried out by Watson Wyatt as at 5 April 2000 using the projected unit method.
The principal assumptions were that retail price inflation would be 3% per annum, pension increases would be in line with price inflation, real salary growth would be 1.75% per annum and the real investment return would be 3% per annum.
At that date the market value of the schemes assets was 83.6 million.
Assets represented 89% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members to that date, and the shortfall in value is being funded by increased contributions from the company.
An actuarial valuation of the Morland defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 1 October 2000 using similar assumptions.
The market value of the assets of the scheme was 17.3 million which represented 122% of the accrued member benefits.
For FRS 17 purposes, the most recent valuations have been updated to 4 May 2003, using the principal assumptions that price inflation would be 2.50% per annum 2002 - 2.50%, pension increases would be in line with price inflation, real salary growth would be 1.75% per annum 2002 - 1.75% and the discount rate would be 5.40% per annum 2002 - 5.75%.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided for is 16.8 million 2002 - 9.7 million.
