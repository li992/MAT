21 PENSIONS Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benets FRS 17 has been adopted in full with effect from 1 January 2003.
The adoption of FRS 17 has required a change to the accounting treatment of dened benefit pension arrangements, such that the Group includes the assets and liabilities of these arrangements in the Groups balance sheet.
Current service costs, curtailment and settlement gains and losses, and net financial returns are included in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The Group operates several pension arrangements: the Groups total pension cost included within operating profit was 13.0 million 2002 11.5 million, restated, being 7.2 million 2002 6.4 million, restated in respect of its dened benefit pension arrangements and 5.8 million 2002 5.1 million in respect of its dened contribution arrangements.
This total pension cost included within operating profit compares to 16.0 million 2002 12.5 million, which would have been incurred under the previous accounting policy.
Restatement of comparatives Prior year results have been restated as follows: Group Net Tax on profit operating interest on ordinary profit for profit payable activities the period Group profit and loss account million million million million Year to 31 December 2002 As previously stated 196.0 46.9 57.7 108.8 Adoption of FRS 17 1.0 0.3 0.7 As restated 197.0 46.9 58.0 109.5 Provision Net profit Other for liabilities pension and loss debtors and charges liabilities account Group balance sheet million million million million 31 December 2002 As previously stated 1,019.9 18.6 392.5 Adoption of FRS 17 2.7 6.9 23.8 19.6 As restated 1,017.2 11.7 23.8 372.9 68 Alliance UniChem Plc 21 PENSIONS CONTINUED UK scheme The Group operates a principal UK pension scheme which has two plans: the UK benefit Plan which is a funded dened benefit arrangement, and the UK Contribution Plan, which is a funded dened contribution arrangement.
Both plans are administered by an independent company and their assets are held under trust separately from those of the Group.
The pension costs in respect of the UK benefit Plan are assessed in accordance with the advice of Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, an independent rm of actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation used for this purpose was carried out as at 1 January 2003.
This has been updated by Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow to take account of the requirements of FRS 17, in order to assess the liabilities at 31 December 2003.
Following the valuation, it was agreed to adopt an employer contribution rate of 10.9% of pensionable pay, effective from 1 January 2004.
In addition annual payments of 5.5 million have been agreed for 2003, 2004 and 2005 and further annual payments of 4.3 million for the subsequent 11 years.
Previously, the rate payable had been 13.3% of pensionable pay since 1 January 2001.
Other schemes The Group also sponsors a number of dened benefit plans outside of the UK, some of which are material.
In The Netherlands there is a dened benefit pension plan, which is administered by a separate pension fund.
In France there are insured arrangements providing retirement and termination benets.
In Norway many employees participate in an industry-wide multi-employer scheme which is accounted for as a dened contribution plan in accordance with FRS 17.
In addition, in Norway there are two insured dened benefit schemes in place, which are accounted for as dened benefit schemes.
The costs of material dened benefit plans have been recognised in the Group financial statements in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
The financial assumptions for the non-UK plans are weighted averages of the assumptions used for the overseas plans included.
