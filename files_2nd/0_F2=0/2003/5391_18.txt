iii Factors that may affect future tax charges No provision has been made for deferred tax where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets, except where there is a commitment to dispose of these assets.
Such gains would only become taxable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim roll-over relief or offset existing capital losses.
The Group does not expect any such tax to become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of tax on gains arising from the revaluation of fixed assets, as the Group is not committed to the disposal of these assets.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no dividends have been accrued.
Deferred tax assets which have not been recognised are tax losses and credits with a value of 112.1m, depreciation in advance of capital allowances with a value of 10.1m, and other timing differences with a value of 100.1m, as there is insufficient certainty as to the availability of future taxable profits.

Investments: own shares The EMI Group General Employee Benefit Trust EBT was established to hedge the future obligations of the Group in respect of shares awarded under the Senior Executive Incentive Plan SEIP, the EMI Music Long-Term Incentive Plan and other sharebased plans.
The Trustee of the EBT, EMI Group EBT Guernsey Limited, purchases the Companys Ordinary Shares in the open market with financing provided by the Company, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated share liabilities of the Group.

The EBTs waiver of dividends may be revoked or varied at any time.
The cost of the shares expected to be awarded under each plan is amortised over the period from the original grant of the particular award to the time of vesting.
This is normally a period of not less than three years.
The carrying value of the unallocated shares held at the balance sheet date has been written-down to 1 per share to recognise the recent fall in the share price.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued iii Currency exposures As explained on page 28 in the Financial Review, the Groups objective in managing currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas its structural currency exposures is to maintain appropriate levels of borrowings by currency to hedge partially against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being those trading assets and liabilities or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.

vii Hedges As explained in the Financial Review on page 25, the Groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk, using interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2002 0.3 7.6 7.3 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in 2003 1.2 1.2 Gains and losses arising before 1 April 2002 that were not recognised in 2003 0.3 6.4 6.1 Gains and losses arising in 2003 that were not recognised in 2003 0.3 0.3 0.6 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2003 6.7 6.7 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 6.5 6.5 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 or later 0.2 0.2 6.7 6.7 78 19.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued viii Financial instruments Interest rate agreements To manage interest rate risk, the Group has entered into certain interest rate collar and swap agreements which, as at 31March2003, were as follows: Notional Termination principal date Interest rate collars: US dollar $400m April 2003 to February 2004 Euro 90m April 2003 Notional Termination Fixed principal date rate Interest rate swaps: Yen pay fixed rate and receive floating rate 17.5bn April 2004 0.29% Swap unwind: In February 2003, following a routine review of derivative positions in the prevailing market conditions, the Group unwound a US$500m interest rate swap position.
The swap effectively switched the 8.375% fixed coupon on the US$ Guaranteed Notes issued in August 1999 to a floating rate of interest.
The Group received a cash payment of US$86.2m 55.6m on the unwind, representing the present value of the expected cash savings from the swap as determined by the expected differential between US shortand long-term interest rates, discounted at the prevailing market rate.
At 31 March 2002 this swap position had a fair value of 21.0m.
The cash payment is reported on the interest paid line of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
The gain from the unwind will be amortised over the remaining life of the Notes, thus locking in the future interest cost benefit to be obtained from the swap.
The swap unwind reduces the Groups overall interest rate risk.
Exchange rate agreements To manage exchange rate risk on intra-group funding, the Group has entered into certain currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts which as at 31 March 2003 were as follows: Gross notional amount Value purchased date Australian dollar $6.5m April 2003 Canadian dollar $10.0m April 2003 20.
Cash, liquid resources and financing The following definitions have been used: Cash: Cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand if available within 24 hours without penalty, including overdrafts.
Liquid resources: Investments and deposits, other than those included as cash, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
Financing: Borrowings, less overdrafts which have been treated as cash.

There are several guarantees and other contingent liabilities in respect of HMV and HMV Group plc see Note 32 i for details.
Pension arrangements The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The main scheme, which covers employees in the UK, is the EMI Group Pension Fund the UK Fund.
The UK Fund is of the defined benefit type and is open to all permanent employees over the age of 18 employed by the Company and certain subsidiaries in the UK.
Benefits provided by the UK Fund are based on final pensionable pay.
Pensions payable from the UK Fund are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or, if a lower rate, by the increase in the cost of living.
Members contribute to the UK Fund at the rate of 4% of pensionable pay.
Aside from the UK, the Group has significant defined benefit schemes in Germany one scheme and Japan three schemes.
With the exception of these schemes, the other defined benefit schemes operated on behalf of the Group are not material.
The currently agreed rates of contribution by the Group are nil for all significant defined benefit schemes.
Staff engaged in other countries are covered by local arrangements which, in the case of the Group schemes, are of the defined contribution type.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held mainly in separate trustee-administered funds.
Employer contributions of 12.7m 2002: 13.8m were charged to the profit and loss account in the year.
These contributions primarily related to overseas schemes and were determined in accordance with local practice.
Other post-retirement benefit expenses of 0.1m 2002: 0.1m were also charged to the profit and loss account.
Provision is made in the financial statements for the benefits accruing to members of unfunded pension schemes in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
A triennial actuarial valuation of the UK Fund as at 31 March 2003 is currently in progress.
The results of this valuation are expected to be available in the second quarter in the 2003 04 financial year, at which time the Group, together with the Pension Fund Trustees, will determine the future funding strategy.
The latest available actuarial valuation of the UK Fund was made by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2000 using the projected unit method.
At that date the market value of the assets of the UK Fund was taken to be 1,079m.
The market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 117% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to the members, after allowing for assumed increases in earnings, on the actuarial assumptions used, treating the UK Fund as an ongoing entity.
Part of the excess assets disclosed by the 2000 valuation has been used to finance a special increase of 3% to pensions in payment and part has been allocated towards a reduction of employer contributions below the long-term rate, with the balance being carried forward as a reserve in the UK Fund.
Employer expense in respect of the Fund has been calculated in accordance with SSAP24.
On the basis of actuarial advice, it is calculated that the employer expense would represent a credit to the profit and loss account on full application of SSAP24 principles.
However, for reasons of conservatism, such expense has been taken as nil for the two years ended 31 March 2003.
The long-term financial assumptions used to calculate employer expense under SSAP24 are shown below: Growth relative to investment return % per annum Rate of investment return 56 Rate of pay increases 5 Rate of pension increases 3 Rate of price inflation 3 These rates included allowance for the effects of the tax credit changes introduced by the Finance No.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the other two significant defined benefit schemes were carried out as follows: Germany on 1 April 2003 and Japan on 31 October 2000.
The additional disclosures required by FRS17 are set out below.

Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS8 Related party disclosures not to disclose related party transactions between Group subsidiary undertakings.
The Group had several transactions with other related parties during the year.
i HMV and HMV Group plc As part of the sale in 1998 of the companies and assets comprising HMV and HMV Group plc HMV Group the Company acquired a 45.2% equity stake, and 50% of the Junior Preference Shares, in HMV Group for 87.5m.
An additional 25m, in the form of deferred consideration, was to be receivable on inter alia a listing of any part of the share capital of HMV Group on any recognised stock exchange, or 28 March 2003.
In addition, an amount of up to 25m further consideration was to be receivable if Advent International Corporation and related investors achieved a specified return on their investment in HMV Group on a listing.
As a result of additional equity and preference share issues during 1999 by HMV Group, in which the Company subscribed 9m for additional ordinary and preference shares, at 31 March 2002, the Company owned a 42.65% 39.90% fully diluted equity stake in HMV Group, and 18.08% and 49.15%, respectively, of HMV Groups Senior A Preference Shares and Junior Preference Shares.
The Group also made available to HMV Group a 50m working capital revolving credit facility the EMI Revolving Credit Facility, no part of which was drawn during the year.
On 15 May 2002, HMV Group shares were admitted to listing on the London Stock Exchange, pursuant to a global offer which involved the Company selling part of its holding of ordinary shares in HMV Group.
The net cash proceeds payable to the Group as a result of the flotation comprised the following elements, namely 69.4m, representing i the deferred and contingent consideration payable to the Group by HMV Group on its listing under the terms of 1998 sale agreement between the Group and HMV Group, as described above, and ii the redemption of the Companys holding of senior preference shares in HMV Group, together with 72.9m in respect of ordinary shares in HMV Group sold by the Company in the global offer.
Following these transactions, the Group retained a residual shareholding in HMV Group of 14.5%.
This holding was subject to lockup arrangements for six months from flotation.
On 19 November 2002, the remaining 14.5% interest was sold at a price of 120p per share, which raised net proceeds of about 69m.
As part of the 1998 transaction, the Group also entered into an indemnity deed with HMV Group relating, among other things, to guarantees given by the Group of approximately 87 leases.
Under the deed, HMV Group agreed to indemnify the Group against any payments made under those and certain other guarantees and indemnities.
HMV Group undertook to use reasonable efforts to arrange for the release of those guarantees.
The aggregate annual rental payments under guaranteed leases are approximately 24.4m, although they are subject to adjustment both up and down under certain circumstances.
The guaranteed leases have terms which expire in one to 23 years, and many of the leases expire in years beyond 2013.
As part of the flotation arrangements, the EMI Revolving Credit Facility was cancelled.
The indemnity deed remains in force in respect of lease guarantees, and HMV Group has secured those obligations pursuant to a security deed, the Companys rights under which rank second behind banks which provide senior credit facilities to HMV Group.
Under the 1998 Sale Agreement, as from 31 May 2003, HMV Group employees will cease to be active members of the Groups UK Fund.
They will have the opportunity to join the HMV Group Pension Scheme and, if they so elect, to transfer their Group Fund benefits in terms of accrued service to the HMV Scheme.
The Sale Agreement provides for a transfer payment to be made from the Groups UK Fund to the HMV Scheme in respect of benefits so transferred, the transfer payment being made in accordance with actuarial assumptions but agreed as part of the Sale arrangements.
If the transfer payment so calculated exceeds the share of the assets of the Groups UK Fund attributable to the transferring members, the Company is obliged to make up the shortfall.
An estimate of 5m was provided in the year in respect of the Companys potential liability in this regard and charged as a nonoperating exceptional item see Note 9 ii for further details.
The Group also assigned various trademarks to HMV IP Limited including the Dog and Gramophone trademark and HMV acronym in consideration for the payment of 2m over a period of three years.
