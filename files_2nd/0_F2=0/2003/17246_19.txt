qxp 4 5 04 12:03 PM Page 42 MAKING WAVES WOLFSON MICROELECTRONICS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 : 042 Statement of Directors responsibilities UK Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
qxp 4 5 04 12:03 PM Page 43 WOLFSON MICROELECTRONICS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 MAKING WAVES : 043 Independent auditors report to the members of Wolfson Microelectronics plc We have audited the financial statements on pages 44 to 64.
We have also audited the information in the directors remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the directors remuneration report.
As described on page 42, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession's ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors' report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on page 33 reects the Companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report, including the corporate governance statement and the un-audited part of the directors remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited.
OPINION In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2003 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended: and the financial statements and the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

qxp 4 5 04 12:03 PM Page 48 MAKING WAVES WOLFSON MICROELECTRONICS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 : 048 Notes forming part of the financial statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The Company has followed the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement benets in these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertaking made up to 31 December 2003.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Turnover Turnover represents the amounts excluding value added tax derived from the provision of goods and services to customers.
Turnover from product sales is recognised in the profit and loss account upon sale to the end customer or, where the Company sells to its distributors, on sale to the distributor where there are no further obligations on the Company, and when the associated economic benets are due to the Company and the turnover can be measured reliably.
Design income on specic contracts is recognised with respect to the stage of completion and the expected costs and time to complete.
Turnover is recognised in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract.
Associated costs are written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Where turnover exceeds payments on account, an amount recoverable under contracts is established and given within debtors.
Where payments on account exceed turnover, a payment received on account is established and given within creditors.
Royalty income represents revenue earned under joint product development agreements.
Such revenue is earned and income is recognised when sales of the developed product to third parties for which royalty is due are confirmed to the Company.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis in order to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible xed assets over their estimated economic lives as follows: Freehold property 25 years Computer hardware and software 1 to 3 years Plant and machinery 1 to 3 years Motor vehicles 4 years Furniture and ttings 10 years Land is not depreciated.
Leased assets Tangible xed assets which are acquired under finance leases and similar hire purchase contracts are capitalised at the market value of the assets at the start of the lease, and are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated economic lives or the term of the lease.
Outstanding obligations under the leases, net of finance charges, are included as liabilities.
Operating lease costs are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Government grants Government grants receivable to assist the Company with revenue costs in respect of development work are offset against the related costs in the profit and loss account.
qxp 4 5 04 12:03 PM Page 49 WOLFSON MICROELECTRONICS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 MAKING WAVES NOTES : 049 Functional and reporting currency In the period covered by this report the Group has experienced a marked increase in the level and proportions of revenues and costs denominated in US dollars.
Having regard to the levels of such transactions in the year to 31 December 2003 the Group believes that the functional currency changed to the US dollar during the current financial year.
For this reason the reporting currency has been changed to US dollars with prior year comparatives restated accordingly.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UK, the opening balance sheet and prior year comparatives previously presented in sterling have been restated by translation into US dollars at the relevant closing exchange rate, while profit and loss information, previously presented in sterling has been restated by translation into US dollars at the relevant average exchange rate.
In 2003, as a result of the listing on the London Stock Exchange, significant sterling denominated share capital was raised.
The directors consider it appropriate to record the equity share capital at the exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
The exchange rates used are shown below: PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT BALANCE SHEET AVERAGE RATE CLOSING RATE Year ended 31 December 2002 1.5025 1.6099 Period ended 30 September 2003 1.6108 1.6606 Differences arising on the translation of prior period comparatives have been dealt with through reserves.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Stocks Raw material stocks are valued at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value.
Contract work in progress is stated at costs incurred, less that transferred to the profit and loss account, after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with turnover.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development is charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which it is incurred.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Pensions The Company operates a pension scheme providing benets based on final pensionable pay.
This scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 2 July 2002.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those in the Company.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the anticipated average service lives of the Companys employees.
The Company also operates a dened contribution pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.

The pension cost charge for the year represents contributions payable by the Company to the scheme and amounted to $65,000 2002: $3,000.
Contributions amounting to $10,000 were payable to the scheme and are included within creditors at 31 December 2003 2002: $nil.
The Company also operates a pension scheme providing benets based on final pensionable pay, contributions being charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Company.
During the year ended 31 December 2002 this scheme was closed to new entrants.
The contributions are determined by a qualied actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation was at 2 January 2001.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments 7.0% p. a. and the rates of increase in salaries 5.0% p. a. and pensions 5.0% p. a..
The most recent actuarial valuation showed that the value of the schemes assets was 2,774,400 $4,144,000 at 2 January 2001.
This represented 116.8% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
A bulk transfer from a previous scheme was received after the valuation date.
The valuation allowed both for the transferred liabilities and the discounted value of the transferred assets.
The contributions of the Company and employees are 7.6% and 6.0% of earnings respectively.
The pension charge for the period in respect of the dened benefit scheme amounted to $293,000 2002: $243,000.
Whilst the Company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pensions costs, under FRS 17 Retirement benets the following transitional disclosures are required: 53815 Wolfson Acc.
qxp 4 5 04 12:03 PM Page 61 WOLFSON MICROELECTRONICS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 MAKING WAVES NOTES : 061 23 PENSIONS CONTINUED The most recent full actuarial valuation was as at 2 January 2001.
The actuary has estimated the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2003 and as at 31 December 2002, to take account of the requirements of FRS 17, based on this valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003 and at 31 December 2002.
The major financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 31 DECEMBER 31DECEMBER 31 DECEMBER 2003 2002 2001 Valuation method Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 4.25% 4.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.37% 5.75% 5.87% Ination assumption 2.90% 2.50% 2.60% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
As the scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Scheme assets The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash ow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: LONG TERM LONG TERM LONG TERM RATE OF RETURN RATE OF RETURN RATE OF RETURN EXPECTED AT VALUE AT EXPECTED AT VALUE AT EXPECTED AT VALUE AT 31 DECEMBER 31 DECEMBER 31 DECEMBER 31 DECEMBER 31 DECEMBER 31 DECEMBER 2003 2003 2002 2002 2001 2001 $000 $000 $000 Equities 7.5% 5,389 7.5% 3,674 7.5% 4,026 Other 4.0% 11 4.0% 84 4.0% 33 Total market value of assets 5,400 3,758 4,059 Present value of scheme liabilities 10,571 6,396 4,797 deficit in the scheme 5,171 2,638 738 Related deferred tax asset 1,551 791 221 Net pension liability 3,620 1,847 517 The amount of this net pension liability would have a consequential effect on reserves.

Shortly afterwards Cirrus led a complaint with the US International Trade Commission ITC in Washington D. C. claiming infringement of the same patents and seeking a ban on importation into the USA of a number of the Companys products and on the products of third parties that include those products of the Company.
The Company is currently engaged in the legal proceedings at both the District Court and the ITC, which are expected to take some time to resolve.
The Company and its subsidiary undertaking have counterclaimed against Cirrus in the civil action pending in the US District Court in San Diego.
The counterclaims are for: 1 declarations that the Cirrus patents are not infringed by the Company, are invalid, and are unenforceable: 2 unfair competition under state common law and statutory law: 3 unfair competition under the Federal Lanham Act: 4 tortious interference with the Companys prospective economic advantages with customers and others: and 5 tortious interference with the Companys existing contracts with its customers and others.
The Company has reviewed Cirrus claims with its legal advisers and believes that the claims do not have merit.
The Company does not believe that the allegations will have a material adverse effect on its business and consequently it does not anticipate making a provision in its accounts for them.
The Company will vigorously defend itself against these allegations.
