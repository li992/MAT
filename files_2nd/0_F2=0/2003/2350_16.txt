Notes to the accounts 1 Basis of preparation The Group accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings all of which are made up to 31 December 2003.
As provided for by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account is not presented for the Company.
2 Accounting policies Convention The financial information is prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include revaluation of the fixed asset properties and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
The Group has adopted early Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38: Accounting for ESOP trusts for the 2003 year end.
As a result of the implementation of the requirements of this Abstract, shares in the Company held through Group controlled employee share scheme trusts, which were previously reported as investments, are now recorded as a deduction in equity.
At 31 December 2003, the carrying value of these shares was 1,390,000 which has been set against the profit and loss reserve in the balance sheet.
Changes in own shares held and UITF 17 expense charges are recorded in the Group reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
The comparative figures for investments and profit and loss reserve have been amended to reflect the change in treatment.
The comparative figures included in the Group reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds have been restated in a prior year adjustment to reflect this changed treatment such that shareholders funds at 1 January 2002 have been reduced by 1,333,000.
The Group has implemented the transitional rules of FRS 17: Retirement Benefits during the year.
Required disclosures are included in note 27.
Turnover and profits Turnover principally arises from the sale of residential properties and land.
Turnover and profits in respect of house sales, land sales and land exchanges are taken at the time of legal completion of the sale.
Turnover does not include the sale of properties accepted in part exchange.
The net profits or losses arising on the sale of part exchanged properties are accounted for in cost of sales.
Profits arising from land exchanges are recognised only when the profits are supported by cash generation.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
Fixed assets and depreciation In complying with FRS 15: Tangible Fixed Assets revalued tangible fixed asset properties owned by the Group at 31 December 1999 are retained at their prevailing book values as at 31 December 1999.
In doing so, the directors have carried out an impairment review as at 31 December 2003 and have confirmed the prevailing valuations as acceptable.
Depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold properties based upon the difference between book value and estimated residual value charged over the estimated useful life of the property.
The directors are of the opinion that, having regard to estimated residual values, based on prices prevailing at the dates of acquisition or subsequent revaluation, and the estimated useful economic lives, the depreciation rate should be 2% per annum on a straight line basis.
All the properties are subject to an annual impairment review.
An impairment loss on a revalued property is recognised in the profit and loss account if it is caused by a clear consumption of economic benefits.
Other impairments of revalued properties are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses until the carrying amount of the property reaches depreciated historical cost and thereafter in the profit and loss account.
Impairment losses on other properties held at cost are charged to the profit and loss account.
Plant and machinery is depreciated on a 33.3% reducing balance basis.
Computer equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over three years.
Office machinery is depreciated on a 25% reducing balance basis.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 71 Notes to the accounts continued 2 Accounting policies continued Operating leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Stocks and work in progress Development properties are recorded at cost.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of sale, is recorded at cost and contains no addition for overheads.
Land acquired on deferred terms through the use of bills of exchange is included based on the face value of the bill.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised and amortised over the life of the option to enable full amortisation at the date the option period ends.
Options are reviewed for impairment on a regular basis and provision made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The remaining amortised cost of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option.
Raw materials and consumables are recorded at cost as invoiced by suppliers.
Housing stocks and properties taken in part exchange are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work in progress is valued at prime cost of labour and materials with an addition for overheads other than those for general administration.
Progress payments received and receivable from contracts are deducted from work in progress.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of stocks and work in progress to estimated realisable value.
Bills of exchange Bills of exchange accepted by the Group in connection with the purchase of land on deferred terms are included at the face value of the bill from the date of acceptance.
Pensions Pension contributions for the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme, a defined benefits scheme, are charged to the profit and loss account on a basis which spreads the cost over the employees expected average working lives with the Group.
Pension contributions for the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Segmental information As the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, no segmental analysis is required.

8Pensions The required disclosures under FRS17: Retirement Benefits are included in note 27.
The following disclosures are based on the accounting rules under SSAP24: Accounting for pension costs.
The Bovis Homes Pension Scheme is an occupational pension scheme providing benefits based on employees length of service and final average earnings.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a trust separately from the Company.
The Group paid contributions during 2003 equal to the 2003 pension cost of 2,191,407 2002: 2,215,772.
The 2003 pension cost is based on the results of the actuarial valuations completed at 30 June 2001, carried out by an independent qualified actuary.
The 2001 actuarial valuation revealed that the pension cost was 20% of pensionable earnings less lower earnings limit adjustments where appropriate.
The 2001 valuation used the projected unit method, the assets were taken into account at their market value and the assumptions used to value the Schemes liabilities were as follows: 2001 valuation assumptions % per annum Discount rate - for past service 6.0 - for future service 6.5 Rate of increase in earnings 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions - for service to 5 April 1997 2.25 - for service from 6 April 1997 2.5 Rate of price inflation 2.5 At the date of the 2001 valuation 30 June 2001 the market value of the Schemes assets was 31.0 million and the actuarial value of the Schemes assets represented 97.5% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution scheme established on 1 January 2002 for new employees joining the Group.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated on profit after tax of 86,513,000 2002: 73,503,000 over the diluted weighted average of 117,267,429 2002: 116,616,844 ordinary shares potentially in issue during the year.
The diluted average number of shares is calculated in accordance with FRS 14: Earnings Per Share.
The dilutive effect relates to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the year.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the year.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria as at the year end have been included in the dilution calculation.
There is no dilutive effect on the profit after tax used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held in employee share trusts where dividends have been waived.

Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 79 Notes to the accounts continued 18 Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, bank loans and overdrafts, and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the financial instrument disclosures.
Throughout the period under review, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
The Group has various bilateral committed revolving loan facilities.
At 31 December 2003 these facilities totalled 211 million with seven banks.
These facilities are split into five tranches: Facility Set up date Maturity date 35 million 11 December 2000 10 December 2005 20 million 11 December 2000 10 December 2007 124 million 10 January 2002 9 January 2007 20 million 6 February 2002 5 February 2007 12 million 3 May 2002 2 May 2007 At 31 December 2003, 136 million of these facilities remained undrawn.
The facilities which mature on 10 December 2005 and 10 December 2007 were fully drawn.
Of the facility which matures on 9 January 2007, 20 million was drawn.
Financial assets and liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2003 comprised: 2003 2002 000 000 Cash balances 5 4 Short term deposits 30,000 81,544 Bank overdraft and bank loans repayable within one year 279 1,935 Bank loans repayable after more than one year 75,000 75,000 Other debtors falling due after more than one year 5,577 5,082 Other creditors due after more than one year 20,703 16,657 The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 was as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Floating rate 279 1,935 Fixed rate 75,000 75,000 No interest 20,703 16,657 95,982 93,592 The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets at 31 December 2003 was as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Fixed rate 30,000 81,544 No interest 5,582 5,086 35,582 86,630 Page 80 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
uk Notes to the accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued The maturity of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 can be analysed as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 One year or less, or on demand 279 1,935 More than one year but not more than two years 43,893 7,821 More than two years but not more than five years 51,810 83,836 95,982 93,592 The floating rate bank overdraft is subject to interest rates related to bank base rate and is repayable on demand.
The fixed rate financial assets relate to cash placed on the money market.
These sums earn interest based on interest rates set by contract and have short term fixed periods to maturity.
At 31 December 2003 the Group held borrowings of 75 million.
These borrowings, although repayable at dates in 2004 are drawn down through bilateral committed revolving loan facilities which mature at dates after 31 December 2004.
The borrowings are capable of being refinanced under these facilities and are therefore disclosed as liabilities due after more than one year.
Of the 75 million of borrowings, 35 million is repayable on 11 June 2004 and attracts a fixed rate of interest of 6.57% per annum, 20 million is repayable on 11 June 2004 and attracts a fixed rate of 6.70% per annum and 20 million is repayable on 9 January 2004 and attracts a fixed rate of interest of 6.09% per annum.
All of these loans have interest rates which are based on floating interest rates prevailing at the dates of drawing down, however, the rates of interest are fixed through interest rate swap arrangements.
The interest rate swap arrangements which fix the interest rates payable on 55 million of the Groups borrowings were established on 11 December 2000, 35 million fixed for a five year period and 20 million fixed for a seven year period.
The swap arrangements are recalculated on a semi annual basis to fix the interest rates at 6.57% and 6.70% respectively.
The interest rate swap arrangements which fix the interest rates payable on the remaining 20 million of the Groups borrowings were established on 10 January 2002 for a five year period.
These swap arrangements are calculated on a semi annual basis to fix the interest rate at 6.09%.
The weighted average interest rate applying to borrowings as at 31 December 2003 was 6.48% 2002: 6.48% and the weighted average maturity period of borrowings was 2.8 years 2002: 3.8 years.
The Group has not entered into derivative transactions other than the interest rate swap arrangements.
Other debtors and other creditors due after more than one year are not subject to interest.
Other than the Groups borrowings, amounts due after one year relate almost exclusively to sums due on land purchase contracts.
These sums are generally due for payment based upon details included within the land purchase contract and their maturity is therefore certain.
The fair value of land creditors due after more than one year amounted to 17.5 million 2002: 13.4 million compared with their carrying value of 20.1 million 2002: 16.1 million.
The fair value was derived from the discounting of future cash flows in settling land creditors.
The fair value of the Groups fixed rate borrowings, fixed by interest swap arrangements, repayable after more than one year amounted to 77.2 million 2002: 78.7 million compared with their carrying value of 75.0 million 2002: 75.0 million.
The increase in fair value over book value reflected the cost of borrowing prevailing at 31 December 2003 as against the fixed rate of borrowings arising from the swap arrangements.
The fair value differences of the long term financial liabilities are not required to be accounted for within the profit and loss account.
The differences as disclosed will reverse as these liabilities near their maturity.
There were no material differences between the book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets due after more than one year.
The fair value was calculated by discounting expected cash flows arising on such financial assets.

Assuming this condition is satisfied options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the dates of grant shown above.
As at 5 March 2004 options granted on 8 December 1997, 2 April 1998, 17 March 1999, 17 September 1999 and 16 March 2000 have satisfied the condition.
The rules of the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme specify that, under normal circumstances, options may be exercised after five years or seven years depending on which savings contract is chosen by the employee.
The option period then extends for six months from the appropriate date.
