A deferred tax asset of 19,670,000 2002 14,980,000 has been recognised in respect of these amounts.
Of this total, 5,271,000 2002 11,174,000 relates to the Global Switch group of companies.
The group has other tax losses which do not currently satisfy the criteria for recognition as a deferred tax asset.
The tax value of these losses is approximately 25,000,000 2002 37,000,000.
Of this total, 9,000,000 2002 9,000,000 relates to the Global Switch group of companies.
No provision has been made for taxation which might become payable if the groups investment properties and operating assets were sold at the net amount at which they are stated in the financial statements: the additional taxation liability could amount to approximately 92,500,000 2002 115,000,000 in respect of investment properties and approximately 2,900,000 2002 3,600,000 in respect of operating assets.

9 Loss and net assets per ordinary share The calculation of basic loss per ordinary share is based on the loss for the year of 44,631,000 2002 loss of 15,807,000 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue of 281,633,610 2002 270,361,399.
No further adjustment has been made to the number of ordinary shares in issue when calculating the diluted loss per share because of the anti dilutive nature of that adjustment.
The calculation of basic net assets per ordinary share is based on the net assets of 920,293,000 2002 1,023,147,000 and on the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the year of 282,186,927 2002 281,388,627 which excludes shares held for awards under the LTIP.
The calculation of diluted net assets per ordinary share allows for the exercise of outstanding share options, where the exercise price is below the market value of the shares at the end of the year, and the vesting of the LTIP shares.

ix Group policy with respect to derivatives The group uses a combination of xed rate loans and interest rate swaps to reduce the groups sensitivity to interest rate uctuations to an acceptable level.
The proportion of borrowings that are at xed rates varies but is maintained within limits set by the board.
At the balance sheet date, 57 per cent 2002 65 per cent of the groups net borrowings were xed.
The xed interest period is matched to the length of the relevant property income stream taking account of market rates quoted at the time.
Assets denominated in currencies other than sterling, such as the groups investment properties in the US and the Global Switch properties held outside the UK, are largely nanced by borrowings in the same currency so as to minimise the groups exposure to foreign exchange movements.
Other exposures to foreign exchange are hedged with forward contracts where possible to x the rate at which these amounts are converted into sterling.

ii As part of the letting arrangements by PDCL to Orange plc Orange of The Point building at Paddington Basin, London, W1, Orange was granted an ability to require PDCL to assume the lease obligations of some of its existing ofces in London.
Orange has served notice to operate these provisions which involve a number of alternative outcomes and it is not possible at this stage to estimate their ultimate financial effect.
iii The company has guaranteed, for a maximum three year period, the annual rental obligations, amounting to 2.3 million, of PDCL.
The joint venture itself receives rental income which is applied against the rental obligations which have been guaranteed.
It has also guaranteed other performance obligations of PDCL.
iv Global Switch has guaranteed the rental obligations of a subsidiary undertaking up to a maximum of 10 million.
2003 2002 30 Capital commitments 000 000 Capital expenditure contracted but not provided for 56,965 28,439 The company has been granted options to acquire the entire issued share capital of Stannifer Group Holdings Limited Stannifer which is engaged in the development of retail facilities and mixed use schemes in city centre locations.
Stannifers estimated net asset value at 31 December 2003 was 75 million and the cost of exercising the options, which currently lapse on 17 March 2004, will be approximately 65 million on that date.
The company has made loans and advances at 31 December 2003 of 9.9 million to Stannifer and the company which granted the options and these amounts are included in other debtors in note 16.
In the event that the options are not exercised, a loan and other costs amounting to 9.3 million will be written off.
31 Related party transaction Contracts were exchanged during the year with a company controlled by the step father-in-law of D Phillips, a director of the company, relating to the sales of three properties in New York for a total consideration of $100 million.
Completion of the sales of two of the properties occurred in December 2003, and has therefore been recognised in the results for the year, and completion of the sale of the third property occurred in January 2004.
60 32 Post balance sheet events i Offer for the company It was announced on 26 January 2004 that an offer had been made by Duelguide plc to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the company and that the offer had been recommended for acceptance by those directors who were regarded as independent for the purposes of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
The outcome of the offer is not known at the date of the approval of these financial statements.
Provision has been made for costs of 1.3 million incurred by the company to the balance sheet date in relation to the offer.
The company has agreed to pay to Duelguide plc an inducement fee equal to 8.95 million, in the event that, after the date of the announcement: a the independent directors of the company withdraw or adversely modify their recommendation of the offer other than as a result of certain circumstances as outlined in the offer announcement.
b a third party offer for the company is announced before the Duelguide offer has lapsed or been withdrawn and the competing offer subsequently becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects within one year of the date that the Duelguide offer lapses or is withdrawn.
ii Investment in Global Switch It was announced on 15 September 2003 that a conditional contract had been exchanged to establish a new limited partnership to own and operate the European facilities of Global Switch and that Norwich Unions life funds, managed by Morley Fund Management, would be investing 51.5 million, as adjusted by reference to new lettings or lost income during the period between exchange and completion and also by reference to the net assets at completion, for a founding 25 per cent share of that partnership.
Upon completion, the company will receive net cash proceeds of approximately 41 million, adjusted as explained above, after deduction of costs and payment of certain other transaction related expenditure, giving rise to a loss on disposal of approximately 12.9 million.
Provision has been made for the costs of 3.4 million incurred by the company to the balance sheet date but the balance of the loss has not been recognised in the 2003 financial statements as the contract was not completed until February 2004. iii Funding of White City development It was announced on 29 December 2003 that conditional agreements had been entered into with Commerz Grundbesitz  CGI in relation to the construction and funding of the White City development at Shepherds Bush in West London.
The arrangements anticipate the company and CGI each ultimately retaining a 50 per cent interest in the completed development.
The development itself will be carried out by the company which will receive over the life of the project 22 million in project management fees, 18 million of which is to be placed in escrow.
CGI will meet all costs of construction, which are expected to be in the region of 1,150 million including fees and accrued interest.
The freeholders, London Underground Limited and the company will grant a new lease to CGI as part of a variation of the existing arrangements.
In consideration for the initial transfer to CGI, the company will receive in cash 200 million plus reimbursement of development expenditure incurred by Chelseld since the commencement of substantial construction in autumn 2003.
20 million of the amount receivable by the company is to be held in escrow with interest accruing to the company during the period of development.
The arrangements include a repurchase obligation upon the group in respect of a 50 per cent interest in the completed development.
The group has committed to repurchase its share of the project for a consideration xed at 100 million, being one half of the initial transfer consideration for the new lease, plus 50 per cent of actual development costs as 61 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Post balance sheet events continued funded by CGI.
Accordingly, the total repurchase consideration is expected to be of the order of 675 million.
The companys obligation to repurchase is to be secured by a bond of 200 million, plus the 38 million aggregate escrow amounts in respect of land and project management fees referred to above.
The companys absolute liability in respect to the undertaking given to repurchase is capped at 238 million.
In addition, the company and CGI have agreed to give completion guarantees to London Underground Limited as is conventional for a project of this nature involving major infrastructure works.
iv Acquisition of remaining interests in White City development A conditional contract was exchanged in December 2003 to acquire the outstanding 25 per cent interest in the White City Shepherds Bush Limited Partnership.
The conditions were fullled and the acquisition was completed in January 2004. v Subsequent sale of investment property The sale of Riverside House, Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1, for which contracts were exchanged in 2003, was completed in February 2004 and will therefore be recognised in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2004.
The net proceeds amounted to 89.5 million which approximated the carrying value of the property and its accrued rental income in the financial statements at 31 December 2003.
