Retail sales of 3.6 billion represented its second best year, only 10 per cent lower at CER than the record sales JNL delivered in 2002.
This was driven by record sales of variable annuities, which at 1.9 billion were up 55 per cent on 2002 at CER.
Total sales for the year were down 23 per cent on 2002 at CER to 4.1 billion due to the lower retail sales together with a reduction in sales of institutional products.

PHILIP BROADLEY Asia GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR Solvency margins have been maintained at levels at or above local regulatory requirements by the insurance operations in Asia.
INHERITED ESTATE The long-term fund contains the amount that the Company expects to pay out to meet its obligations to existing policyholders and an additional amount used as working capital.
The amount payable over time to policyholders from the With-Profits Sub-Fund is equal to the policyholders' accumulated asset shares plus any additional payments that may be required by way of smoothing or to meet guarantees.
The balance of the assets of the With-Profits Sub-Fund is called the inherited estate and represents the major part of the working capital of Prudentials long-term fund which enables the Company to support with-profits business by: providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees: providing investment flexibility for the funds assets: meeting the regulatory capital requirements, which demonstrate solvency: absorbing the costs of significant events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting bonus and investment policies.
The Company believes that it would be beneficial if there were greater clarity as to the status of the inherited estate and therefore it has discussed with the Financial Services Authority FSA the principles that would apply to any re-attribution of the inherited estate.
No conclusions have been reached.
Furthermore, the Company expects that the entire inherited estate will need to be retained within the long-term fund for the foreseeable future to provide working capital and so it has not considered any distribution of the inherited estate to policyholders and shareholders.
