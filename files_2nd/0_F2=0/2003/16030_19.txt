Pension arrangements Defined benefit scheme During the year, the group operated one final salary scheme: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the Group Scheme, the assets of which were held in a separate trustee administered fund, funded by contributions from the group companies and the employees.
Contributions are paid to the trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of each scheme every three years.

At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
The groups planned level of capital investment is expected to remain at similar levels.
Therefore, it expects to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years, at a similar level to the current year.
The taxation charge is based on profit before tax for the year at the UK standard rate.
There is no tax charge on profits on disposal of properties due to claims for rollover relief for which no deferred taxation provision has been made, or a tax credit in respect of the amortisation of goodwill.

Earnings per ordinary share a Basic earnings per ordinary share 2003 2002 Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated from the following ratio: Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 108.9m 91.8m Average number of shares in issue 112,782,720 112,177,252 b Diluted earnings per ordinary share 2003 2002 Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated from the following ratio: Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 108.9m 75.0m Average number of shares including outstanding options 114,359,686 113,835,241 The difference in the average number of shares in issue used as the denominator for the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share is due to the premium element of share options still outstanding at the end of each financial period, based on the average mid-market price for that year.
The adjustment to the number of shares is: 2003 2002 No.
Premium element of share options based on average mid-market share price for the year 1,576,966 1,657,989 c Adjusted earnings per ordinary share Adjusted earnings per ordinary share are calculated based upon earnings before amortisation of goodwill and profit on the sale of properties and are presented in addition to the basic earnings per share calculated in accordance with FRS 3 and FRS 14 since, in the opinion of the directors, this presents a better like-for-like comparison of the earnings of the group between the relevant periods.
Basic earnings per share may be reconciled to adjusted earnings per share before amortisation of goodwill and profit on the sale of properties as follows: 2003 2002 Adjusted earnings per ordinary share 110.0p 91.6p Amortisation of goodwill 13.5 p 10.8 p Profit on sale of properties - 1.1p Basic earnings per ordinary share 96.5p 81.9p 61 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC 10.

Purchase of business undertakings During the year the group acquired 12 limited companies and the assets of 5 other businesses, details of which on an individual basis are not material to the financial statements.
All the acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
On acquisition, the value of the assets of each business have been reviewed and where appropriate, been revalued to their fair values based on either an independent valuation or a value based on group accounting policies.
These fair value and accounting policy alignments, that are included below, are based on the best information available currently and as such are provisional for all businesses acquired during the year ended 31 December 2003.
Further adjustments may be necessary during 2004 when additional information is available.
