Foreign comprises the Groups transactions conducted through offices outside the UK and through those offices in the UK specifically organised to service international banking transactions.
2 The classification of a loan as non-accrual, past due 90 days or troubled debt restructuring does not necessarily indicate that the principal of the loan is uncollectable in whole or in part.
Collection depends in each case on the individual circumstances of the loan, including the adequacy of any collateral securing the loan and therefore classification of a loan as non-accrual, past due 90 days or troubled debt restructuring does not always require that a provision be made against such a loan.
In accordance with the Groups provisioning policy for bad and doubtful debts, it is considered that adequate provisions for the above risk elements in lending have been made.
3 The Groups UK banking subsidiary undertakings account for loans on a non-accrual basis from the point in time at which the collectability of interest is in significant doubt.
Certain subsidiary undertakings of the Group, principally Citizens, generally account for loans on a non-accrual basis when interest or principal is past due 90 days.
4 Overdrafts generally have no fixed repayment schedule and consequently are not included in this category.
5 Loans that are current as to the payment of principal and interest but in respect of which management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with contractual repayment terms.
Substantial security is held in respect of these loans and appropriate provisions have already been made in accordance with the Groups provisioning policy for bad and doubtful debts.
