Other borrowings are drawn over a fixed term period at floating rates, with rates varying between 2.6% and 4.2%.
Borrowings repayable after five years comprise guaranteed senior secured loan notes in Sterling and US Dollars issued via a private placement during 2002, totalling 169.7m 2002 185.3m, with a maturity profile of 44.7m due in 2009, 80.3m due in 2012, and 44.7m due in 2014.
The weighted average maturity is 8.8 years 2002 9.5 years.
The time weighted average interest rate, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps, as at 31 December 2003 was 5.35% for Sterling borrowings, 5.97% for US Dollar borrowings and 2.65% for Euro borrowings.

Currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities After taking account of the interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest, the currency profile was: 2003 2002 51101000011 051001001 Non-interest Floating Non-interest Floating bearing rate Total bearing rate Total m m m m m m Financial assets Sterling 1.1 2.3 3.4 0.9 1.0 1.9 US Dollar 14.1 2.5 16.6 15.5 2.3 17.8 Other 16.5 16.5 16.5 16.5 15.2 21.3 36.5 16.4 19.8 36.2 Financial assets comprise: cash 20.9m 2002 18.9m, short-term deposits 0.4m 2002 0.9m, and fixed asset investments 15.2m 2002 16.4m.
There is no fixed maturity for financial assets on which no interest is paid.
Floating rate assets and liabilities bear interest at market rates for bank deposits and borrowings based on LIBOR and national base rate equivalents.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid do not have fixed maturity dates and, therefore, it is not possible to calculate a weighted average period of maturity.
Fixed rate liabilities comprise unsecured loan notes in Sterling and US Dollars issued in 2002 under a private placement totalling 169.7m 2002 185.3m.
The above analysis includes interest rate swaps amounting to 176.0m 2002 182.0m, of which 77.9m 2002 81.1m are cancellable by third parties in 2004.

Where appropriate, local currency borrowings and swaps are used to hedge the currency exposure arising from the translation of overseas net assets in the same currency.
Offsetting assets and liabilities are defined as those that give rise to no gain or loss in the profit and loss account because they are either denominated in the same currency as the Group activity to which they belong or, because under the provisions of SSAP 20, exchange gains and losses on the translation of currency borrowings qualify as a hedge against currency net investments and are recognised in the statement of total gains and losses.
Operating companies are required to hedge with Group Treasury all significant currency transaction exposures into their functional currency.
After taking into account the effect of any hedging transactions to manage currency exposures, the Group did not have a material profit and loss exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities at 31 December 2003 or 2002.
US Dollar borrowings in UK companies amounted to $250.0m in 2003 2002 $250.0m.
Euro borrowings in the UK amounted to 92.0m in 2003 2002 21.3m.
Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations The book values and estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities were: 2003 2002 0511110011 05100111 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Financial assets 36.5 36.5 36.2 36.2 Bank overdrafts 8.9 8.9 20.6 20.6 Loans and finance leases excluding forward foreign currency contracts and interest swaps 277.0 277.0 292.4 292.4 Other financial liabilities 8.0 8.0 14.2 14.2 Derivative financial instruments held to manage currency exposures Interest rate swaps 4.1 6.5 Forward foreign currency swaps 2.5 0.3 The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is the estimated amount that the Group could expect to pay or receive on the termination of the contracts.
These values are based on quotations from counterparties, taking into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been assessed by discounting future cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or there is no material difference between book and fair value.
43 Kidde plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Financial instruments continued Principal hedging instruments At 31 December 2003, forward foreign currency contracts were outstanding to a total Sterling value of 274.0m 2002 83.7m representing hedges in respect of future transaction and translation exposures.
At 31 December 2003, interest rate swaps totalling 176.0m 2002 182.0m were outstanding.
The net effect of these interest rate swaps was to convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rates.
Gains and losses on hedges Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments used for hedging are not recognised in the Financial Statements until the hedged exposure is itself recognised.

The closing provision relates principally to the costs of integrating the IFTE Group now Kidde Fire Trainers, The Briton Fire Company Limited, Ajax Fire Protection Services BV and the fire business of Kongsberg Maritime into the Industrial Fire Protection Division in 2004.
Post-retirement the Kidde Group has a wide range of post-retirement obligations which vary by country and company.
These are longterm liabilities, assessed using actuarial principles and are calculated in accordance with SSAP 24.
It is expected that the utilisation in a given year will be offset by the profit and loss account charge in respect of active members.
Litigation environmental provision has been made for the anticipated cost of resolving litigation and environmental issues, based on professional advice.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain, but it is expected that these provisions will be utilised over the short to medium-term.
Property the provision covers onerous contract obligations for leasehold properties where vacated or where the sublet income is insufficient to meet all obligations under the lease.
The duration of these contracts ranges from one to ten years.
Warranty provision has been made for the likely costs arising on returned products under warranty of 5.2m 2002 5.8m.
Such warranty periods continue for up to ten years and the provision is based on levels of claims experienced historically.
Specific allowance is made for known product warranty issues.
Provision has also been made for potential claims arising from warranty and indemnity claims under the sale contracts on disposal of businesses of 0.6m 2002 2.1m.
Other provisions consist of a wide range of other individually small obligations provided in accordance with FRS 12.

Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary.
SSAP 24 Retirement benefits The principal defined benefit schemes operate in the UK and the US.
The key assumptions used in the SSAP 24 valuation of the UK and US schemes are: UK US %% Rate of price inflation 2.5 2.0 Return on assets above inflation pre-retirement 7.0 7.5 post-retirement 5.5 7.5 Increase in earnings above inflation 2.5 2.0 The UK pension scheme, which was closed to new members in 2000, was last valued at 5 April 2002.
The total market value of the assets of the fund was 51.0m which compares with the past service liabilities of 56.2m producing a deficit of 5.2m.
This deficit is being spread over the average service lives of 12 years.
The contribution rate during the year was 11.2% 2002 11.2%.
The US pension scheme was formally valued at 31 December 2003.
The market value of the investments of the fund was 28.1m 2002 25.9m which compared with the past service liabilities of 31.0m 2002 33.2m, producing a deficit of 2.9m 2002 7.3m.
Additional contributions are being made to correct the deficiency on a current funding basis.
The Group also operates other post-retirement benefit schemes in a number of countries throughout the world.
The principal scheme is the post-retirement medical scheme in the US.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit method.
The charge for the year was 0.1m 2002 0.1m.
The key assumptions used in the most recent valuations at 31 December were: 2003 2002 % % Discount rate 7.5 7.5 Medical inflation rate 5.0-6.5 5.0-6.5 FRS 17 Retirement disclosures Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension costs, under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits the following transitional disclosures are required: The pension valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based upon to the most recent full actuarial valuations at 5 April 2002 and 31 December 2003 for the UK and US schemes respectively.
These valuations have been updated where appropriate, to take account of FRS 17s requirement to assess liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at each respective balance sheet date.
