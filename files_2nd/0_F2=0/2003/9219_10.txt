Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which they can be recovered.
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would arise from the future disposal of any fixed assets shown in the accounts at valuation, except to the extent that at the balance sheet date there is a binding sale agreement.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.

Eligibility for benefits is normally determined primarily according to an employees length of service and level of responsibility.
The amount of some benefits are proportionate to individual salary.
Benefits may include paid leave for holidays, maternity and illness, as well as insured benefits.
The latter can cover private healthcare for the employee and immediate family, long-term disability, personal accident and death in service cover.
Company cars, including fuel benefits, are provided predominantly to meet job requirements but also to certain executives.
The principal benefit schemes are: i Pensions A number of pension schemes are operated by the Company and its subsidiaries.
Schemes reflect local conditions and the practices in the countries concerned.
Contributions to the pension schemes, by both companies and employees, are held in segregated funds or are insured and are independent of the Groups finances except where, due to local conditions and practices, pensions are not externally secured.
The Company pension arrangements are described on page 44, note 26.
The UK scheme is the Hilton Group Pension Plan.
Membership is optional and there is a separate section for senior executives.
The scheme is contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and is exempt approved by the Inland Revenue.
Accordingly, benefits are restricted by Inland Revenue limits.
Hilton Group Pension Plan Members contribute on average 6% of pensionable salary per annum.
Benefit accrues to provide a target pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary for an employee attaining age 65 with at least 40 years membership for joiners after June 2002 target pension is half final pensionable salary.
A spouses pension is payable following death.
Hilton Group Pension Plan Senior Executive Section Members contribute on average 8% of pensionable salary per annum.
Benefit accrues to provide a target pension from all sources of two-thirds of final pensionable salary for an executive attaining age 60 with at least 20 years membership for joiners after June 2002, employees attaining age 65 with at least 26.7 years service.
Spouses and childrens pensions are payable following death.
Senior executives subject to the Earnings Cap The Hilton Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme HUURBS was introduced with effect from 1 December 2000.
This is a voluntary, non-contributory arrangement available to senior UK executives whose annual basic salary exceeds the level of the Earnings Cap.
Members are notionally credited with an amount equal to 42% of annual basic salary in excess of the Earnings Cap, which is revalued each year.
The HUURBS will provide a cash benefit for participants or their dependents.
As an alternative to membership of HUURBS, senior executives affected by the Earnings Cap may elect to receive a salary supplement of 30% of annual basic salary above the Earnings Cap.
In lieu of the Hilton Group Pension Plan and HUURBS, senior UK executives may choose to receive a salary supplement of 30% of full basic salary.
ii Employee share schemes Details of employee share schemes operated by the Company are shown in the separate booklet Directors Remuneration Report.
Details of options granted in 2003 and outstanding as at 31 December 2003 are shown on page 40, note 21.

Such gains would only become taxable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim roll-over relief or offset capital losses.
No provision has been made for deferred tax of 89.2m 2002: 92.8m in respect of tax on gains arising from the revaluation of fixed assets, as the Group is not committed to the disposal of these assets.
No provision for deferred tax has been made in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no dividends have been accrued.
Deferred tax assets of 42.7m have not been recognised, as there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of timing difference can be deducted.

26 Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major schemes are defined benefit funds, with assets held separately from those of the Group.
Although Hilton is responsible for the operation of these arrangements, professional advisers are appointed to run them.
The total pension cost for the Group in 2003 was 25.8m 2002: 16.2m, composed of defined contribution payments of 4.6m 2002: 4.9m, defined benefit regular cost of 10.8m 2002: 11.1m and a defined benefit variation cost of 10.4m 2002: 0.2m.
This variation has been calculated using the straight line spreading method, over the future working lifetime of current scheme members.
The pension cost relating to the defined benefit schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method or, where appropriate for closed schemes, the attained age method.
The major UK scheme is the Hilton Group Pension Plan.
The key assumptions used to calculate the pension cost for this scheme, which represents the majority of the Groups pension commitment, was that pre-retirement investment returns would exceed increases in earnings by 4.2% a year, and post-retirement investment returns would exceed 5% Limited Price Indexation by 3.4% and 3% Limited Price Indexation by 3.7% a year.
The market value of assets is used.
44 Hilton Group plc Annual Report 2003 26 Pensions continued The latest actuarial valuations of the principal funded defined benefit schemes were carried out between 2001 and 2003.
At the operative dates of the latest actuarial valuations the aggregate market value of the assets of these schemes was 241.1m 2002: 280.5m.
In aggregate the value of the assets represented 82% 2002: 102% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
For the funded plans, debtors include 15.1m 2002: 16.8m in respect of the excess of the accumulated contributions paid to the pension schemes over the pension cost charged to the profit and loss account.
In addition, unfunded liabilities exist: German partially unfunded, Swedish pension arrangements and a UK arrangement with liabilities of 7.3m, 6.8m and 1.4m respectively, measured between 2001 and 2003 and a post-retirement medical arrangement with liabilities of 1.1m 2002: 1.5m.
These schemes are included in the pension cost above and are represented on the balance sheet by a total accrual of 17.7m 2002: 15.1m.
The Group has no significant exposure to any other retirement obligations.
The actuarial valuations were updated to 31 December 2003, by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
In accordance with FRS 17, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method.
Some of the Groups smaller schemes are closed and using this method will, in isolation, lead to the current service cost for these schemes increasing as their members approach retirement.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the UK defined benefit schemes and a weighted average of the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the non-UK defined benefit schemes.
The table also sets out as at 31 December 2001, 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the deficit of assets compared to the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax credit and the net pension liability.
