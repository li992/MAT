The cash payment was subsequently made by the Company convention, as modied by the revaluation of certain xed assets, and on 23 April 2003. in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
On 12 April 2003, the Company acquired the leisure retailing subsidiaries Fixed assets and depreciation of Six Continents PLC for 1,744m and also received a dividend from Six Continents PLC for the same amount.

Variations in regular pension costs are amortised over the average expected future service life of current employees on a straight line basis.
Accumulated differences between the amount charged to the profit and loss account and the payments made to the pension plans are treated as either prepayments or creditors in the balance sheet.
In respect of the Groups dened contribution arrangements, the charge against profits is equal to the amount of contributions payable.

The plans are predominantly dened benefit schemes to current members.
For new entrants, the plans provide dened contribution benets.
The assets of these plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
On 1 April 2003, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited became the sponsoring employer for the former Six Continents Pension Plan and Six Continents Executive Pension Plan, after the transfer of obligations and related assets to newly created InterContinental Hotels Group pension schemes.
The Six Continents Pension Plan and Six Continents Executive Pension Plan were subsequently renamed the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan and Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan respectively.
Under the principles of merger accounting, the Mitchells & Butlers element of the Six Continents PLC pension plans is reected in these financial statements for the periods prior to 1 April 2003.
The Group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
They reflect the 31 March 2002 actuarial valuations of the Six Continents PLC pension plans.
The significant assumptions in these valuations were that wages and salaries increase on average by 4% per annum, the long-term return on assets is 6.3% per annum, and pensions increase by 2.5% per annum.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is 13 years.
At 31 March 2002, the market value of the combined assets of the Six Continents PLC pension plans was 1,187m and the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 100% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
Since 1 April 2003, the Group has made regular contributions to the pension plans of 10m, including 5m prepaid for the year to 30 September 2004, and additional contributions of 27m.
The agreed employer contribution rates to the dened benefit arrangements for the year to 30 September 2004 are 11.0% for the MABPP and 27.1% for the MABEPP.
In addition, it has been agreed that further additional contributions of 55m will be paid over the next three years, 35m of which was paid on 14 November 2003.
Annual Report 2003 31 Notes to the financial statements continued 7.
Pensions continued FRS 17 disclosures The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures are based on the results of the full actuarial valuations carried out at 31 March 2002 updated by independent qualied actuaries to 30 September 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 30 September 2003 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the pension plans are now closed to new members as defined benefit schemes, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
The principal assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the liabilities on an FRS 17 basis were: At At At 30 September 30 September 30 September 2003 2002 2001 Wages and salaries increases 4.2% 3.8% 3.9% Pensions increases 2.7% 2.3% 2.4% Discount rate 5.3% 5.5% 6.1% Ination rate 2.7% 2.3% 2.4% The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP and the expected rates of return were: 30 September 2003 30 September 2002 30 September 2001 Long-term Long-term Long-term rates rates rates of return of return of return expected Value expected Value expected Value %m % m %m Equities 8.0 396 8.0 364 7.5 502 Bonds 4.9 355 4.7 285 5.1 219 Property 8.0 74 8.0 66 7.5 68 Total market value of assets 825 715 789 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,068 913 771 deficit surplus in the scheme 243 198 18 Related deferred tax asset liability 73 59 5 Net pension liability asset 170 139 13 2003 2002 Movement in the deficit surplus: m m At 30 September 2002 198 18 Current service cost 13 12 Past service cost 1 Contributions 42 18 Finance charge income 2 6 Actuarial loss 71 228 At 30 September 2003 243 198 Includes 5m contributed by Six Continents PLC prior to the separation of the pension schemes.

Dividends The dividend charge for the year of 29m represents the proposed final dividend on ordinary shares of 5.65p per share.
If approved, this will be paid on 16 February 2004 to shareholders registered on 19 December 2003, based on the number of shares in issue following the share consolidation see note 32.
On 9 April 2003, shareholders of Six Continents PLC received an interim dividend of 6.6p per share for the period prior to separation.
Annual Report 2003 35 Notes to the financial statements continued 12.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings available for shareholders of 125m 2002 164m by 735m 2002 734m, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares, excluding investment in own shares, in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by adjusting basic earnings per share to reect the notional exercise of the weighted average number of dilutive ordinary share options outstanding under the Groups share option schemes.
The resulting weighted average number of ordinary shares is 736m 2002 734m.
In arriving at the weighted average number of shares, it has been assumed that the ordinary shares of Mitchells & Butlers plc in issue on 15 April 2003 following separation from Six Continents of 734m was the number of shares in issue prior to separation.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share are calculated as follows: 2003 2002 pence pence per ordinary per ordinary share share Basic earnings 17.0 22.3 Major exceptional items, less tax thereon 3.3 Adjusted earnings 20.3 22.3 Adjusted earnings per share are disclosed in order to show performance undistorted by abnormal items and thereby give shareholders a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
However, due to the significant changes made to the financing structure of the Group on separation, adjusted earnings per share above does not give a true indication of the underlying performance of the Group.
Pro forma earnings per share, which adjusts for the changes in nancing structure, are therefore presented on page 22 of the financial statements.

The transitional rules of FRS 15 have been followed, permitting the carrying value of properties as at 1 October 1999 to be retained.
In 1996, a group restructuring by Six Continents resulted in the transfer at book value of certain xed assets to a subsidiary that subsequently became part of the Mitchells & Butlers group.
The book value included the effect of revaluations undertaken prior to 1996.
Accordingly, the carrying value of the Groups fixed assets reflects those revaluations, which at 30 September 2003 amounted to 400m 2002 404m.
In addition, the carrying value of the Groups xed assets reects the 1999 revaluation see below which at 30 September 2003 amounted to 341m 2002 342m.
The most recent valuation of properties reected in the carrying value of xed assets was undertaken in 1999 and covered all properties then owned by the Group other than leasehold properties having an unexpired term of 50 years or less.

Shareholders of Six Continents PLC were allotted one Mitchells & Butlers plc share and an entitlement to a cash payment of 81p per share for each Six Continents PLC share held.
This resulted in the issue by the Company of 866,665,032 ordinary shares of 4.20 each plus an undertaking to pay 702m in cash.
The cash payment was made on 23 April 2003.
On 12 April 2003, the Company acquired the leisure retailing subsidiaries of Six Continents PLC for 1,744m and also received a dividend from Six Continents PLC for the same amount.
The dividend was paid out of the pre-acquisition profits of Six Continents PLC and has therefore been credited to the cost of investment.
No cash was exchanged in respect of these transactions.
On 15 April 2003, the investment in Six Continents PLC was revalued to its market value of 3,078m creating a revaluation reserve of 480m see note 25.
On the same day and following a Court approved reduction in capital, the investment in Six Continents PLC was transferred to the InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and, in return, InterContinental Hotels Group PLC issued one ordinary share to the Companys shareholders for each share held in the Company.
The revaluation reserve became realised at the same time see note 25.

The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 6% after taking account of interest rate hedging and monoline insurance costs.
The securitisation is governed by various conditions, including covenants relating to the maintenance and disposal of the securitised properties.
Return of funds to shareholders and share consolidation The Board has approved the payment of a special dividend of 68p per share to shareholders who were registered on 1 December 2003.
The special dividend will be paid as an interim dividend in respect of the financial year ending 30 September 2004 and is expected to be paid to shareholders on 8 December 2003 at a total cost of 501m.
In connection with the special dividend, a share consolidation was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 1 December 2003 and then implemented on 2 December 2003.
The share consolidation, which is a proportionate reduction in the number of shares in issue, will allow comparability of the Companys share price and dividend per share before and after 1 the payment of the special dividend.
The share consolidation resulted in the issue of 12 new ordinary shares of 7 12p each for every 17 existing ordinary shares of 5p each.
