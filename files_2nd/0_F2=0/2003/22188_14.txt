38 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 Notes to the Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2003 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below: a Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of freehold and long leasehold properties and the valuation of current asset investments held to support insurance activities at market value.
In accordance with paragraph 3 3 of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, the directors have adapted the arrangement of certain headings in the consolidated profit and loss account to reect more appropriately the nature of the groups activities.
In particular, cost of sales includes net interest payable on bank and other borrowings.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to the end of the financial year.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of their acquisition or up to the date of their disposal.
Inter-company sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
c Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of a business or company acquired, as represented by the consideration paid, and the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and trading assets is capitalised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
This reects the period over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying businesses acquired is expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment, in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets and FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill, at the end of the first full year after acquisition and in other years if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Any impairment assessed is charged to the profit and loss account.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 10, up to 31 December 1997 goodwill arising on acquisitions was brought in at cost and offset rstly against negative goodwill arising during the year on similar acquisitions, secondly against available reserves and thereafter against retained profits brought forward.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1 January 1998 has not been reinstated.
On the subsequent disposal of any business to which previously written off goodwill attaches, the related amount is charged or credited in the profit and loss account as appropriate.
Cumulative goodwill relating to acquisitions made prior to 1998, excluding subsequent disposals, written off against reserves since 1 January 1989 amounted to 53 million.
The directors do not consider it practicable to extract information in respect of earlier periods.
Deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions is discounted using an appropriate discount rate, in accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting.
d Turnover Turnover, which is exclusive of value added tax and transactions nanced within the group, comprises: Instalment credit agreements Revenue earned e i below.
Goods and services Gross amounts of goods or services supplied.
Reinsurance Premium income earned e ii below.
Debt collection Fees and commission income on external debt recovered and gross amounts collected on purchased debt.
Brokerage Fees and commission income on loan applications referred to lenders.
Finance leases Revenue earned n below.
Factoring Fees and nancing charges on debts factored.
e Revenue recognition i Instalment credit agreements An initial amount of the gross revenue is credited to the profit and loss account, mainly to cover the costs associated with the setting up of the transaction.
Deferred revenue comprises the remaining amount of gross revenue which is carried forward in customers accounts receivable.
This is calculated to adequately cover future collecting and nancing costs and to allow for an appropriate contribution to profits in subsequent accounting periods.
In respect of home collected credit, deferred revenue is released to profit on a straight line basis in proportion to the reduction in the collectible amount.
Deferred revenue on monthly instalment credit is released on a rule of 78 basis over the lesser of the contracted and effective term of the agreement.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 39 1 Accounting policies continued ii Reinsurance premiums Reinsurance premiums receivable are accounted for net of cancellations, are allocated to each class of cover provided under the insurance agreement and are earned over the risk period of each class in an appropriate earnings pattern.
Reinsurance claims payable are accounted for on a notied basis, together with a provision for claims incurred but not reported.
f Pension funding The group operates a dened benefit pension scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The expected cost of pensions is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service life of employees in the scheme.
Variations from the regular costs are spread over the average expected remaining working lives of current members in the scheme.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
The transitional disclosure requirements under FRS 17 Retirement benets have been adopted in these financial statements and are explained more fully in note 8.
The scheme was closed to new entrants from 1998.
Since 1998, the group has also operated a dened contribution scheme.
The pension cost in respect of this scheme is the contributions payable.
Payments made to personal pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
The group provides no other post-retirement benets to its employees or directors.
g Customers accounts receivable Customers accounts receivable consist of amounts outstanding under instalment credit agreements, finance leases and factoring agreements including repayments not yet due at the year end, less appropriate provision for bad and doubtful debts based upon the individual assessment of accounts and formulae related to past experience.
h Default debt Default debt purchased by The Lewis Group is included at cost and is normally amortised over a period not exceeding six years at a rate based on the expected recoverability of the debt.
i Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise, based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in different periods from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
j Stocks Stocks comprise motor vehicles and retail goods held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
k Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost, unless, in the opinion of the directors, a permanent diminution in value has occurred, in which case the deficiency is provided for and charged in the companys profit and loss account.
l Investments own shares held Own shares held represent the cost of shares in the company held by the trustee of the Employee benefit Trust in respect of the Restricted Share Scheme and are disclosed as xed asset investments.
Information in respect of this scheme, together with details of conditional awards of shares under the scheme, is shown in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration on pages 26, 27 and 31. m Tangible xed assets and depreciation The cost of xed assets is their purchase cost together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible xed assets on a straight line basis by reference to the estimated useful economic life and residual value of the assets concerned, at the following principal rates: Freehold buildings 2% per annum Long leasehold buildings 2% per annum Short leasehold expenditure 5% to 20% per annum Fixtures and equipment 10% to 20% per annum 1 Computer equipment 20% to 33 3% per annum Motor vehicles 20% per annum Assets held for rental 20% per annum Depreciation is not provided on freehold and long leasehold land.
40 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued As permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS 15 Tangible xed assets, the group has chosen to retain the book values of land and buildings which were previously revalued, and not to revalue the assets in the future.
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment, in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, any impairment in value is charged to the revaluation reserve or the profit and loss account, as appropriate.
n Leasing As lessor: Assets owned and leased out to customers under operating lease agreements are recorded as xed assets.
Rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
The amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as customers accounts receivable at the amount of the net investment in the lease.
The total gross earnings are allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net cash investment in each period.
As lessee: Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the agreement and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the agreement and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the agreement in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Operating leases: Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
o Interest rate hedging The cost of any premium paid for the purchase of an interest rate cap or collar is amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the contract and reected in the profit and loss account in the total charge for interest on borrowings.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of financial hedging instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
p Current asset investments Investments held in a managed fund by Progressive Insurance Company Limited comprise mainly xed interest securities and bonds, which are stated at market value in accordance with the Association of British Insurers Statement of Recommended Practice on accounting for insurance business.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of such securities and bonds during the year are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
2 profit before taxation 2003 2002 The profit before taxation for the year is stated after charging: 000 000 Interest on borrowings included in cost of sales bank loans and overdrafts 35,424 30,218 other loans 20,305 21,215 Depreciation on tangible xed assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts 2,291 3,118 on owned tangible xed assets 8,734 8,360 Amortisation of goodwill 3,211 2,084 Loss on disposal of tangible xed assets 755 162 Finance lease charges 444 799 Operating lease rentals land and buildings 6,021 4,250 motor vehicles 3,686 2,002 other plant and machinery 127 81 Pensions to former directors 11 11 Allocations to employee share incentive schemes 3,024 2,227 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 41 2 profit before taxation continued Services provided by the groups external auditors and network rms During the year the group obtained the following services from the external 2003 2002 auditors, all of which were provided in the United Kingdom: 000 000 Audit services Statutory audit Company 31,000: 2003 and 2002 296 276 Audit-related regulatory reporting 12 9 Further assurance services 84 79 Tax services Compliance services 154 87 Other advisory services 620 335 Other services 136 493 1,302 1,279 In addition to the above services, the groups external auditors acted as auditor to the Cattles Staff Pension Fund Limited pension scheme.
The appointment of auditors to the groups pension scheme, and the fees paid in respect of such, are agreed by the trustees of the scheme, acting independently from the management of the group.
In appointing the external auditors to carry out non-audit related services, and in setting their fees for such work, the directors have due regard to the groups policy in respect of non-audit related services as set out in the Report of the Board on Corporate Governance on page 24 and the benets, financial and non-financial, expected to be obtained.
In the opinion of the directors, these fees represent value for money.
Further assurance services includes work on due diligence, group reorganisations and the IFRS Transition Impact Study.
Other services includes work on share schemes, organisational reviews and corporate finance advice.
3 Holding company profit and loss account The consolidated profit includes 9.4 million 2002: 148.0 million, including reorganisation dividends of 130.0 million from subsidiaries, which has been dealt with in the financial statements of the company.
The company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and has not included its own profit and loss account in these financial statements.
The post acquisition trading result of the acquisition made during 2003 is not material and hence, in accordance with FRS 3 Reporting financial performance, has not been separately disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss account.
42 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 Notes to the Accounts 5 Taxation 2003 2002 The charge for taxation based on the profit for the year is as follows: 000 000 Current tax: UK corporation tax at 30% 2002: 30% 33,232 28,486 Adjustments in respect of previous years 52 595 33,180 27,891 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of timing differences 3,063 2,051 Adjustments in respect of previous years 360 1,117 36,603 26,957 The standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 30% 2002: 30%.

The total value of shares vested in the directors during the year under the Restricted Share Scheme was 314,000 2002: 553,000.
A detailed analysis of all directors emoluments, including salaries, benets in kind, performance related bonuses, share options, long term incentives and pension arrangements, is provided in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration on pages 30 to 33 and forms part of these financial statements.
The average monthly number of persons employed by the group during the year 2003 2002 was as follows: Number Number Consumer Division 4,512 4,035 Corporate Division 135 130 Central Support Services 48 173 Total 4,695 4,338 44 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 Notes to the Accounts 8 Pension costs SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs The group operates a funded dened benefit pension scheme for employees which is contracted out of the state scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in a trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary using the projected unit method.
This scheme was closed to new entrants from 1998.
Actuarial valuations are normally carried out triennially, the most recent valuation being as at 31 March 2001.
At that date the market value of the assets of the scheme was 34.0 million excluding assets relating to members additional voluntary contributions, representing 84% of the market-related value of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions, relative to price ination, which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation, are those relating to the rate of return on assets, the rate of increase in earnings, and the rate of equity dividend growth.
For the valuation, it was assumed that the return on assets would exceed price ination by 3.8% per annum existing investments and 4.5% per annum future investments, salary increases would exceed price ination by 2.0% per annum, and dividend growth would exceed price ination by 1.2% per annum.
These assumptions have also been used to calculate the pension cost for accounting purposes.
The funding shortfall disclosed has been spread over 10 years, representing the average expected future working lives of scheme members, using the straight line method.
The cumulative excess of the groups contributions over pension cost at 31 December 2003 amounted to 0.1 million compared with a deficit of 0.8 million at the previous year end.
An amount of 0.9 million has therefore been credited to the profit and loss account in the current year in respect of this movement and is included within the group charge for pension cost for this scheme for the year of 1.7 million 2002: 1.9 million.
Throughout the year, the group has paid contributions to the pension scheme of 2.6 times member contributions, together with supplementary contributions of 1.5 million based on the shortfall determined at the previous actuarial valuation at 2001.
In 2004 the company is expected to continue to contribute to the fund at a rate of 2.6 times member contributions, and the supplementary contributions will amount to 2.2 million.
Members have contributed at the rate of either 3% or 5% of pensionable salaries, depending on their membership status, throughout the accounting period.
The group also operates dened contribution group personal pension schemes for new employees and existing employees who are not members of the dened benefit pension scheme.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes is the contribution payable of 0.8 million 2002: 0.8 million.
FRS 17 Retirement benets As noted above, the group operates a dened benefit pension scheme for certain staff.
The scheme is funded and is contracted out of the state second tier of pension provision.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.
However, as the contributing membership reduces, pensionable payroll is expected to reduce over the longer term, and this is likely to more than offset the rising contribution rate.
The last formal valuation of the scheme was performed as at 31 March 2001 by a professionally qualied actuary.
The next valuation is due to be made as at 31 March 2004.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement benets, a funding review of the scheme was carried out by the independent qualied actuary as at 31 December 2003.
The following information, in respect of the dened benefit scheme, is provided for disclosure purposes only, as required by FRS 17.

It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Fund relating to individual participating employers.
As such, in accordance with FRS 17, the company will account for its liability to the Fund as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
Thus no disclosure of the balance sheet position will be made and the charge to profit and loss under FRS 17 in future years will represent the actual contributions paid by the company.
The rates of contribution are as shown above and are the same for all participating employers.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 47 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held note 13 which are treated, for this purpose, as being cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated after adding back goodwill amortisation of 3.2 million 2002: 2.1 million, to provide additional analysis of the underlying performance of the group.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Interest rate prole of financial liabilities All foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately swapped into Sterling at the commencement of the facility agreement and, hence, the group is not exposed to currency rate uctuations.

The current asset investments held by Progressive Insurance Company Limited are stated at market value and are, therefore, booked at fair value.
The book value of deferred consideration is discounted, in accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting, and therefore equates to fair value.
The fair values of longer term bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings, related financial hedging instruments and customers accounts receivable are estimated by discounting the associated future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 December 2003.

60 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 Notes to the Accounts 31 Acquisitions i Prior year acquisitions As permitted by FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting the fair values of the net assets acquired in 2002 have been reassessed as at 31 December 2003.
The effect of this has been to reduce the fair value of customers accounts receivable related to the acquisition of the motor finance loan portfolio by 3.9 million.
Additionally, management has reviewed the amount of deferred consideration payable in respect of the Dial4aloan acquisition, which has been reduced by 1.6 million.
The combined effect of all revisions has been to increase goodwill by 2.5 million, as set out below: Provisional Fair value Final fair value adjustments fair value 000 000 000 Tangible xed assets 194 194 Customers accounts receivable 55,713 3,924 51,789 Debtors 1,700 132 1,832 Cash at bank and in hand 2,665 2,665 Creditors 1,716 59 1,775 Taxation 1,036 1,036 Deferred tax 35 35 57,485 3,851 53,634 satisfied by: Cash 61,806 173 61,979 Loan notes 11,500 11,500 Deferred consideration 2,743 1,574 1,169 76,049 1,401 74,648 Goodwill note 10 18,564 2,450 21,014 ii Current year acquisitions The group acquired the whole of the issued share capital of Hathgap Limited on 30 June 2003 for consideration of 3.6 million, of which 3.5 million is deferred.
The discounted value of the deferred consideration on acquisition amounted to 2.6 million.

Following the acquisition, the trade of Hathgap Limited was transferred to Progressive Financial Services Limited and began trading as Welcome Car Finance from 1 July 2003.
The post acquisition results and cash ows of Welcome Car Finance were not material and hence, in accordance with FRS 3 Reporting financial performance and FRS 1 Cash ow statements, have not been separately disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss account or in the notes to the cash ow statement.
32 Contingent liabilities The company remains as guarantor of a proportion of the leases of properties held and utilised by Homestyle Group plc formerly Rosebys PLC entered into when that company was a wholly owned subsidiary undertaking.
The maximum liability under these guarantees amounts to 1.1 million 2002: 1.4 million.
33 Related party transactions The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 Related party transactions from disclosing transactions between the company and other group undertakings as all such transactions have been eliminated fully on consolidation in these financial statements.
