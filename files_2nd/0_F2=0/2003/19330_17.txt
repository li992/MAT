30 Pillar Property PLC Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and in accordance with applicable accounting standards consistently applied and with the Companies Act 1985 except as noted below under investment properties.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings and the appropriate share of the results and net assets of joint venture operations.
Goodwill, being the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the underlying net assets, previously written off against reserves has not been reinstated.
Goodwill arising in future will be capitalised in the balance sheet and written off to the profit and loss account over its useful life.
On disposal of an acquired business any balance of goodwill relating to its acquisition is written off through the profit and loss account.
Basis of preparation scheme of arrangement and return of capital On 11 June 2002 Pillar Property PLC announced its intention to return approximately 143 million to shareholders via a court approved scheme of arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985 the Scheme.
Under the Scheme, for every 100 existing shares held or part thereof, shareholders received 76 New Pillar shares and 100 in cash.
To facilitate this Scheme a new holding company Pillar Property Group PLC New Pillar was created and renamed Pillar Property PLC.
The existing holding company was renamed Pillar Property Group Limited Old Pillar and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Pillar.
The Scheme was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 23 July 2002 and was sanctioned by the High Court on 16 August 2002.
As set out below, the Scheme has been accounted for using merger accounting principles in order to show a true and fair view.
New Pillar was incorporated on 29 May 2002.
Prior to 16 August 2002, it did not trade, pay any dividends or make any other distributions and had issued 50,000 ordinary shares of 1 each, 49,998 of which were redesignated into redeemable preference shares of 1 each, 25p paid.
Effective from 16 August 2002 and pursuant to the terms of the Scheme, New Pillar acquired Old Pillar through the issue to Old Pillar shareholders of in aggregate 109,028,111 New Pillar shares 7 of 422p each, in consideration for the cancellation of their Old Pillar shares, and the issue by Old Pillar to New Pillar of 143,458,042 new shares of 29 17p each.
Under the Scheme, the shareholders of Old Pillar received, for every 100 Old Pillar shares cancelled or part thereof, 76 New Pillar shares of 422p and 100 cash.
Following the implementation of the Scheme, the share capital of New Pillar was reduced by reducing the nominal value of each New Pillar share from 422p to 10p per New Pillar share and accordingly its total paid up share capital was reduced by 449,195,817.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a merger, the true and fair override being applied such that the fair value acquisition accounting requirements of the Companies Act 1985 have not been adopted as, in the opinion of the directors, this would not give a true and fair view as the Scheme, in substance, represents a change in identity of the holding company rather than an acquisition of a business.
Share capital and reserves comparatives in the consolidated balance sheet have been restated to reflect the nominal value of the shares in issue immediately prior to the reorganisation.
Details of these restatements are set out in note 22.
Differences between the restated amounts and the previously reported capital and reserves, represent the merger difference, and have been reflected in the merger reserve.
The directors consider that it is not practicable to quantify the effect of this departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements.
As a consequence of creating a new holding company under the Scheme, there are no comparative figures for the company.
Investment properties Completed investment properties are revalued annually on the basis of open market value.
Investment properties under development are revalued annually by the directors based on formal external assessments of gross development value given to the directors by the groups valuers.
Surpluses and deficits on revaluation are taken to the revaluation reserve, except for those deficits expected to be permanent, which are included in the profit and loss account for the year.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties.
Leasehold investment properties are not depreciated where the unexpired term is over 20 years.
This treatment for certain of the companys investment properties represents a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Purchases and sales of investment properties and properties held for resale are recorded when contracts have been exchanged by the year end, and are wholly unconditional by the date of approval of the accounts.
Surpluses and deficits realised on sales of properties, calculated by comparing net sales proceeds with book values, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Gains arising in the current year on the sale of the groups properties to unit trusts are recognised in the profit and loss account pro rata to that proportion of the total proceeds received in cash.
The gains relating to that proportion received in units are taken to the revaluation reserve.
Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at directors valuation which represent the underlying net asset value.
Development properties Development properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost includes directly attributable costs together with interest on specific external debt.
Profits on sales are recognised when the overall profitability of the development can be reasonably foreseen.
31 Pillar Property PLC 1 Accounting policies continued Depreciation Tangible fixed assets are depreciated by equal instalments over their expected lives.
The rates used are: Vehicles and equipment 25% Furniture and fittings 10% Deferred taxation Provision is made at the appropriate rates, using the liability method, for deferred taxation arising from temporary timing differences.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
Operating Lease Incentives Rent frees given to tenants are amortised over the earlier of either the period of the lease, or, to when the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rate, usually the first rent review.
Capital contributions given to tenants are shown as a debtor, and amortised over the earlier of either the period of the lease, or, to when the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rate, usually the first rent review.
The valuation of the properties is reduced by the total of the unamortised capital contributions and rent frees.
On the disposal of properties, the unamortised rent incentives are charged against rental income and the balance of the unamortised capital contributions are charged to the disposal of investment properties.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in sterling at the rates ruling on the date of those transactions.
Exchange differences arising in the ordinary course of trading are included in the profit and loss account.
For the purposes of consolidation, the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts of subsidiary undertakings and where appropriate their branches, that are denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to the revaluation reserve, net of exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Leasing Rentals on operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under hire purchase agreements are recorded in the balance sheet as an asset and an obligation to pay future rentals.
Depreciation is charged over the assets useful lives and finance charges accrue at a constant rate over the lease term.
Turnover Turnover, which is stated net of VAT, is derived from sale proceeds of development properties, together with net rental income from operations in the United Kingdom and Europe.
Hedging costs Hedging costs are amortised over the life of the hedging instruments and the element not amortised is included within prepayments.
Pension costs The company makes payments to individual pension schemes on behalf of certain employees on a fixed percentage contribution basis.
Interest Interest incurred on loans specific to properties in the course of development is capitalised.
Interest is capitalised only during the development phase and ceases to be capitalised once the development is completed and ready for occupation.
All other interest is charged to the profit and loss account.
