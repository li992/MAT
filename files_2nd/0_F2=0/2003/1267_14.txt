Interest rate and currency profile The interest rate and currency profile, after taking account of interest rate and cross currency swaps, of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2003 was as follows: Fixed rate interest financial liabilities Weighted average Floating rate Weighted period for financial average which rate Total liabilities Principal interest rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 266.6 49.7 216.9 6.4 3.0 Euro 64.2 26.3 37.9 4.9 3.9 Danish Krone 22.1 16.8 5.3 6.0 5.6 Swedish Krone 17.8 17.8 Currency swaps: Euro liability 177.9 177.9 3.7 1.9 Danish Krone liability 58.7 58.7 3.1 1.6 Sterling asset 219.9 219.9 3.8 3.5 All currencies 387.4 110.6 276.8 5.8 1.8 Although the Group only has a net exposure under the currency swaps, in order to fairly present the impact of the currency swaps on the interest payable on the Groups financial liabilities, the gross notional liability and asset arising from the currency swap transactions are shown in the table above.

The Group had short-term cash deposits of 90.7 million, of which 54.7 million was in Sterling, 18.5 million in Euros and 17.5 million in Danish Krone, which earn interest at rates based on UK base rates or on the relevant national inter bank interest deposit rate equivalents.

56 Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 www.
co. uk 15 Pensions At 31 December 2003 the Group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their representative independent actuaries.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Merseyside Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2001.
For the purpose of arriving at the pension cost charged in the accounts the defined benefit funds including Arrivas share of the Merseyside Pension Fund were last assessed on 5 April 2003 by their respective actuaries, using the Projected Unit Method.
The principal actuarial assumptions were that: i the annual rate of return on investment would be 2.75 per cent higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration of 3.75 per cent and, where relevant, ii there would be no variation from a schemes rules to pensions in payment.
On the basis of these assumptions the actuarial value of the funds at 5 April 2003 was sufficient to cover 85 per cent of the benefits then accrued to members.
A net prepayment of 32.2 million 2002: 44.4 million is included in the accounts.
The market value of the various schemes assets at 5 April 2003 was 327 million.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Northern, Arriva Trains Wales and the former employees of Arriva Trains Merseyside participate in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The accounting policy is to charge the contributions to these pension sections to the profit and loss account in accordance with actuarial advice.
This is on the basis that there is no recourse to the Group for any over or under funding of their sections of the RPS following expiry of the franchises.
During the first half of 2003 the sections to which Arriva Trains Northern and Arriva Trains Merseyside contributed were subject to a pensions contribution holiday.
In July 2003 Arriva Trains Northern re-commenced payment of employers contributions.
The Arriva Trains Merseyside franchise ceased operation in July 2003.
The total pension cost for the Group was 35.2 million 2002: 19.5 million.
The pension cost in respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes was 14.9 million 2002: 11.8 million.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will be mandatory for the Group in its accounts for the year ending 31 December 2005.
Prior to this, transitional disclosures are required, and these are set out below.
The directors believe that separate consideration should be given to RPS under FRS 17 as the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of these schemes following the expiry of the franchises.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are therefore shown separately and relate to sections in respect of Arriva Trains Wales Limited only.
The calculations used to assess the FRS 17 liabilities of the Groups retirement benefit schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated by Mercer Human Resource Consulting to 31 December 2003.
The same financial assumptions have been used for each of the schemes.
The schemes assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.
The following financial assumptions have been used for each of the schemes: 2003 2002 2001 Valuation method Projected Unit Projected Unit Projected Unit Discount rate 5.4% 5.6% 6.0% Inflation rate 2.5% 2.3% 2.5% Increases to deferred benefits during deferment 2.5% 2.3% 2.5% Increases to pensions in payment 2.5% 2.3% 2.5% Salary increases 3.75% 3.8% 4.0% Expected long-term rate of return at 31 December, before deduction for scheme expenses: Equities 7.8% 7.5% 8.0% Bonds 5.0% 4.7% 5.1% Other 4.8% 4.5% 5.0% Weighted average expected long-term rate of return by scheme at 31 December 7.1% 6.7% 7.3% Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 57 www.
