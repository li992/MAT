50 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards using the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements are made up to 31 March and comprise the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings, together with the Groups share of the results of associated undertakings.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included from or up to the effective date of acquisition or disposal respectively.
Acquisitions The net assets of companies or businesses acquired are incorporated into the Group financial statements at their fair value to the Group at the date of acquisition.
Where the fair value of the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill arising on acquisition.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves.
From 1 April 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years, in line with the directors view of its useful economic life.
On disposal of a previously acquired business, any attributable goodwill that was previously written off to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Investments Acquisitions for which the consideration includes an issue of shares which is eligible for relief under Sections 131 to 134 of the Companies Act 1985 are stated in the company balance sheet at the nominal value of the shares issued, together with the fair value of any other consideration given plus the costs of acquisition.
All other fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment in value.
Current asset investments are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Associated undertakings Associated undertakings are those in which the Group has a participating interest and over which it exerts significant influence.
The Groups share of the results of associated undertakings is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet under the equity method of accounting.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, less depreciation and provision for any impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Short leasehold property over the lease term Plant and machinery heavy production 15 years other 10 years Office equipment 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Leasing and hire purchase commitments Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and leases which result in the transfer to the Group of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of underlying lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives or over the primary lease period, whichever is the shorter.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in each period.
Rentals paid under other leases operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
51 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Stocks and work in progress Stocks are stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in first-out basis, and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads, based on normal levels of activity.
Long-term contracts are stated at costs incurred, which comprise cost of direct materials and labour plus appropriate overhead expenses, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales and after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with turnover.
To the extent that payments on account exceed the value at which long-term contracts are stated, they are included as payments received on account within creditors.
Research and development Development expenditure on clearly defined projects whose outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty is capitalised and amortisation is commenced in the year the expenditure is incurred by reference to the lesser of the life of the project or three years.
All other research and development expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings used to finance the Groups foreign currency equity investments are taken to reserves to the extent that they can be offset against the exchange differences arising on the equity investments.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of non-United Kingdom subsidiary and associated undertakings and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies held by United Kingdom companies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, with the year end adjustment to closing rates being taken to reserves.
Differences on exchange arising from the re-translation at year end rates of the net investment in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings at the beginning of the year are taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the determination of profit for the financial year.
Turnover Turnover comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied by the Group exclusive of value added taxes, sales taxes and intra-group transactions.
In respect of long-term contracts, turnover is calculated on a percentage completion basis, as the cost incurred up to the accounting date plus a proportion of the profit appropriate to the percentage completion of each contract.
The amount by which recorded turnover on contracts is in excess of payments on account is recorded in debtors as amounts recoverable on contracts.
Attributable profit is recognised on long-term contracts only when the profitable outcome of the contract can be reasonably foreseen and is calculated so as to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the year end.
Full provision is made in respect of foreseeable losses on uncompleted contracts.
52 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The regular cost of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes and other post-retirement benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the employees service lives on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Variations from regular cost, arising from periodic actuarial valuations, are allocated over the expected remaining service lives of current employees on the basis of a constant percentage of current and expected future earnings.
The difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the schemes is shown as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the years in which they are payable.
Derivatives Derivatives for hedging purposes are held off balance sheet with the exception of cross currency swaps.
The net exchange gain loss as a result of exchange rate movements is recorded on the balance sheet to reflect the substance of the transaction.
The movements in the balance sheet value are recorded in reserves since the borrowing is a hedge of the associated currency net assets.
The net interest cost income arising on interest rate swaps is charged credited to the interest line in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Finance costs Finance costs are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by the payments made in the period.

Adjusted earnings per share, which gives a useful indication of underlying performance, is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year, before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, amounting to 59.5 million 2002: 98.5 million by 579,004,074 2002: 576,852,235 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on profits of 12.6 million 2002: 70.8 million and a weighted average number of shares of 579,142,718 2002: 579,382,530.
The diluted number of shares takes account of outstanding share options and the fair value of those shares over the year.

Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures: in other words, those transactional or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.

Accordingly, the opening balances on provisions have been restated for the reclassification of 27.2 million of insurance and litigation liabilities, 4.6 million of which were previously reported within creditors falling due within one year and 22.6 million of which were previously reported within creditors falling due after more than one year.
At 31 March 2003, 24.7 million 2002: 22.6 million of the insurance and litigation provision related to provisions for insurance losses incurred but not reported.
This change has been made to more appropriately reflect the uncertainty surrounding the potential timing and amount of the liabilities concerned and had no impact on the reported profit and net assets of the Group.
The business restructuring provision relates to the closure of the Hawker Siddeley Power Transformer business and is expected to be utilised in the next financial year.

25 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits a SSAP 24 disclosures Pensions The main pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and the United States and are defined benefit in type.
These are funded schemes, where the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs for these schemes are determined with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit method.
In line with normal business practice these valuations are undertaken triennially in the United Kingdom and annually in the United States.
For the Groups main defined benefit pension schemes the results of the most recent valuations carried out as at 31 December 1999 for the FKI Group Pension Scheme, 6 April 2000 for the Bridon Group Senior Executive Pension Scheme and 31 December 2001 for the FKI Industries Inc. Group Pension Plans and the principal funding assumptions used are summarised below: Bridon Group FKI Industries FKI Group Senior Executive Inc. Group Pension scheme Pension scheme Pension Plans Principal funding assumptions: Return on assets 6.4% pa 5.8% pa 8.8% pa Rate of salary increases 3.9% pa 4.3% pa 4.5% pa Rate of inflation 2.9% pa 2.8% pa Market value of assets MVA 407.2m 15.3m 250.6m MVA as % of actuarial value of liabilities 119.1% 101.0% 132.3% MVA as % of actuarial value of liabilities minimum funding requirement valuation 111.0% 101.0% This is the third FKI plc Annual report and financial statements to make use of the 31 December 1999 valuation for determining the pension cost for the FKI Group Pension Scheme.
The results of the 31 December 2002 valuation will be available for determining the pension cost in next years Annual report and financial statements.
The Group operates a number of other defined benefit schemes that are accounted for under local rules and also sponsors a number of defined contribution schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to these defined contribution schemes in the year, which were the same as the amount charged to the profit and loss account, amounted to 8.7 million 2002: 9.7 million.
Contributions to the Groups main UK and US defined benefit pension schemes amounted to 13.6 million and 0.3 million respectively and 0.7 million was contributed to the Groups other defined benefit schemes.
The total pension cost to the Group under all schemes was 10.2 million 2002: 11.3 million, after restatement to correctly reflect the disclosure of the amortisation of the surplus in the US defined benefit pension plans and an amount of 58.1 million 2002: 48.3 million is included in prepayments, representing the excess of contributions paid for all schemes over the total pension cost.
The increase in the pension prepayment during the year principally reflects the resumption of regular contributions into the main UK defined benefit schemes, in November 2001.
67 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Notes to the financial statements 25 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued Other post-retirement benefits The Group also operates a number of unfunded post-retirement medical and welfare benefit schemes, principally in the United States.
The cost of these schemes is determined with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions used for the main US scheme were that the long-term increase in health costs would be 8.5% per annum reducing to 5% per annum after the year 2006 at a discount rate of 7.25%.
The total cost of these benefits charged to the consolidated profit and loss account is 6.0 million 2002: 4.5 million and the accrued liability of 42.8 million 2002: 46.5 million is included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
In addition, the Group has other unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations of 6.5 million 2002: 5.8 million.
b FRS 17 disclosures Pensions The information below comprises the additional disclosures required by accounting standard FRS 17 for the Groups principal defined benefit pension schemes and shows, inter alia, what the effect on the financial statements would have been if FRS 17 had been adopted.
In the UK, full actuarial valuations of the FKI Group Pension Scheme and the Bridon Group Senior Executive Pension Scheme were carried out as at 31 December 1999 and 6 April 2000 respectively.
These valuations were updated at 31 March 2003 by an independent professionally qualified actuary using revised assumptions consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
In the US, a full actuarial valuation of the FKI Industries Inc. Group Pension Plan was carried out as at 31 December 2001.
This valuation was updated at 31 March 2003 by an independent qualified actuary using revised assumptions consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries were: 31 March 2003 31 March 2002 UK schemes US schemes UK schemes US schemes % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of increase in salaries 3.6 3.5 3.8 4.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment: Members with limited price indexation minimum 3% 3.5 Nil 3.6 Nil Other members 2.5 Nil 2.7 Nil Discount rate 5.6 6.3 6.1 7.3 Rate of price inflation 2.6 2.5 2.8 3.0 The fair value of the assets, the present value of the liabilities and the expected rates of return at the balance sheet date were: UK schemes US schemes UK schemes US schemes Longterm Longterm Longterm Longterm expected rate expected rate expected rate expected rate of return at Value at of return at Value at of return at Value at of return at Value at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2003 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 2002 % pa m % pa m % pa m % pa m Equities 8.1 199.4 9.0 102.4 8.7 287.5 10.0 162.6 Bonds 4.8 76.1 5.4 79.4 5.4 65.5 6.5 83.7 Other 3.8 6.8 3.5 4.1 4.0 11.3 4.8 5.1 Total fair value of schemes assets 282.3 185.9 364.3 251.4 Present value of schemes liabilities 449.2 188.8 411.7 196.2 Deficit surplus in the schemes 166.9 2.9 47.4 55.2 Limit on recognition of surplus 1.5 22.8 Recognised deficit surplus in the scheme 166.9 4.4 47.4 32.4 Related deferred tax asset liability 50.1 1.8 14.2 13.0 Net pension liability asset 116.8 2.6 33.2 19.4 The net deficit in the US schemes at 31 March 2003 of 2.9 million comprised a deficit of 5.8 million and a surplus of 2.9 million.
For the Groups other defined benefit schemes the net pension liability at 31 March 2003 was 6.7 million 2002: 1.5 million asset.
The FKI Group Pension Scheme is a closed scheme and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

The total cost charged to the profit and loss account would have been 3.6 million, of which 0.5 million related to service cost, 0.1 million to gains on settlements and 3.2 million to interest on liabilities.
A net loss of 2.8 million would have been recognised within the statement of total recognised gains and losses, of which 2.1 million related to experience gains and 4.9 million to losses from changes in assumptions.
The present value of the plan liabilities measured under FRS 17 at 31 March 2003 would have been 50.7 million 2002: 53.9 million with a related deferred tax asset of 20.3 million 2002: 21.6 million.
