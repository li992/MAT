com plc annual review and summary financial statements 2003 Summary Directors remuneration report This section of the Directors remuneration report is not audited Report on remuneration The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and to determine specic remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written Terms of Reference.
Brian Collie is Chairman of the Committee, with Agns Touraine and Sven Boinet acting as Committee members: they are all independent Non-Executive Directors.
Agns Touraine was appointed to the Committee on 28 May 2003 and Sven Boinet was appointed to the Committee on 1 October 2003: Bob Collier, who is also an independent NonExecutive Director, was a member of the Committee until 1 October 2003 and Laurent Laffy was a member of the Committee until 6 March 2003.
The Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and incentives from Halliwell Consulting during the year.
Remuneration policy review and compliance The Committee has recently undertaken a full review of Executive Director and senior executive remuneration which will result in a new senior management remuneration policy which, if implemented in full, the Committee believes will comply with best practice and be suitable for the Companys ongoing requirements.
It is intended that the new policy will include revised bonus and share incentive arrangements which will be performance related and form a significant proportion of overall future remuneration.
The details of the new policy, including the companies within the proposed comparator group, are included in the shareholder circular being sent with this annual report which also explains the proposals for new share schemes to be submitted for approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
Base salary The Remuneration Committees policy is to set the base salaries of the Executive Directors at around the lower quartile to ensure that the xed cost of the Executive team to shareholders is minimised.
The following table shows comparative base salary levels for Executive Directors during the year compared to the proposed comparator group: Brent Hoberman David Howell Martha Lane Fox Clive Jacobs CEO CFO Group MD Vice Chairman Quartile compared to Comparator Group Below lower quartile Below lower quartile Below lower quartile Lower quartile It is the Companys intention to move the salaries of the Executive Directors where necessary toward the lower quartile position over a 12 month period.
Annual bonus In previous years neither Brent Hoberman nor Martha Lane Fox have participated in the Groups annual bonus scheme, the payment of any bonus being determined by the Remuneration Committee having regard to the Companys performance.
David Howell has had an entitlement to a discretionary annual bonus of up to 30% of base salary depending on the achievement of specic targets for each year.
In the year to 30 September 2003, the Remuneration Committee has determined that due to the performance of the Company, in particular the growth of TTV and recording positive EBITDA for the year as a whole, discretionary bonuses of 35% of base salary be paid to Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox.
David Howell has also been awarded a bonus of 35% for the year, being his contractual 30% maximum bonus and an additional 5% discretionary bonus, awarded as a result of Company performance and a successful program of acquisitions and integration resulting in exceptional year-on-year growth in EBITDA.
The bonus payable to Clive Jacobs in the year to 30 September 2003 was awarded as a result of the expected achievement of a TTV target of holiday autos set immediately prior to acquisition in respect of the 12 months to 31 October 2003.
Share incentives To date the Company has operated a number of employee share schemes in which all employees and Executive Directors in the Group participate and a scheme which has been utilised to grant options to some Non-Executive Directors.
Details of options granted to all the Directors are set out on page 12.
New share incentive proposals are set out in the circular despatched to shareholders in relation to the Companys Annual General Meeting.
Pensions In line with the standard employee remuneration package, the Company provides each Executive Director with a salary supplement of 14% of basic salary, which may be taken in cash or by way of a contribution to their individual pension arrangements.
Benefits Benets comprise life assurance, permanent health and private medical insurance.
In addition, Clive Jacobs has additional contractual benets, details of which are disclosed below.
