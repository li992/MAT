35 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Accounts 1.
Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting The Accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In preparing the accounts for the current year the Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benets.
The adoption of the standard is a change in accounting policy and the comparative gures have been restated accordingly.
Details of the effect of adopting FRS 17 are set out in note 32.
The Group has also implemented Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts which requires that the cost of own shares, previously reported as a xed asset investment, be shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.
A prior year adjustment has been made to reect this change.
Details of the effect of adopting UITF 38 are set out in note 32.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet incorporate the audited accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries made up to the balance sheet date.
The Company is not required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are consolidated from the date of acquisition.
The consolidated accounts include the Groups share of profits and losses of its joint ventures and associates.
Associates are entities in which the Group has a continuing participating interest, other than subsidiaries, and exercises significant inuence over their operating and financial policies.
Results are based on management accounts to 31 December.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which are jointly controlled by the Group and other parties are treated as joint ventures.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
The operating results of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling using average exchange rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
profits and losses arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of overseas subsidiaries, treating long term intra-group loans as part of the equity investment, and exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the operating results of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, are dealt with through reserves.
All other profits and losses on exchange are taken to the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange differences on the carrying amount of the related investments.
Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to uctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
Financial instruments will be accounted for as hedges when designated as hedges at the inception of the contract.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
The rates under these contracts are used to record the hedged item and, as such, gains and losses on foreign currency contracts are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities.
Where the contract is a hedge against future transactions, gains and losses are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Interest rate swaps are occasionally used to hedge the Groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the underlying financial instrument.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown in the Group balance sheet at the year end but are disclosed in the fair value table in note 30.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
The aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed in note 30.
36 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Liquid resources include short term deposits, government securities and similar securities, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
Short term debtors and creditors that meet the denition of a financial asset or liability, respectively, have been excluded from all analyses prepared under FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, including numerical disclosures except for the analysis of net currency exposure, as permitted by the Standard.
Turnover Represents the amounts invoiced to customers for goods and services during the year, excluding tax and intra-group transactions.
Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specic contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Where the sale is to a new customer and installation is to be performed, revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance has occurred.
Revenue recognition is also deferred until acceptance where a new product is supplied to an existing customer.
Revenue from multiple element contracts is allocated based on prices charged for each individual element when sold separately.
Revenue from services is recognised ratably over the period of performance.
The Group does not enter into a significant number of long term contracts.
Revenue and estimated profits on long term contracts are recognised under the  method of accounting.
When estimates of total contract revenues and costs indicate a loss, a provision for the entire amount of the contract loss is recognised in the period in which the loss becomes evident.
The Group does not enter into bill and hold transactions.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectibility is probable.
Product Development Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Pension Contributions In the UK the Group operates two dened benefit pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
These schemes require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations.
Other schemes are dened contribution in nature.
The Group has fully adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets in the accounts for the year to 31 December 2003.
This is a change in accounting policy and results in a restatement to the previous years accounts as described in note 32.
The assets of the dened benefit schemes are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of the schemes are measured using the projected unit method.
The discount rate used to measure the schemes liabilities is the current rate of return on an AA corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
The extent to which the schemes assets exceed or fall short of the schemes liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit in the balance sheet net of deferred tax.
The regular service cost of providing retirement benets to employees in dened benefit schemes is charged to operating profit in the year together with the cost of providing benefit improvements in respect of past service and gains or losses arising on settlements and curtailments.
A credit for the expected return on the schemes assets and a charge for the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities because the benets are one year closer to settlement, are included in other finance expense in the profit and loss account.
Differences arising between the actual and expected returns on the schemes assets together with changes in the actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions payable to the other overseas dened contribution plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the year for which they are due.
Deferred Taxation Deferred taxation is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except as referred to below.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Accounting Policies continued Provision is made for tax that would arise on the remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, the dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on fair value adjustments to xed assets arising at acquisition, or gains on disposal of xed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the attributable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its estimated useful economic life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising prior to 1998 and previously written off against reserves has not been reinstated but, in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, would be charged to the profit and loss account on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
Where impairment has been identied in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, goodwill arising prior to 1998 has also been reviewed for impairment.
Other Intangible Assets Other separately identiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees and trade marks are capitalised in the balance sheet only when the intangible asset is purchased in the acquisition of a business and the value can be measured reliably or the intangible asset is purchased separately.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives up to a maximum of 20 years.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Tangible Assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off all other assets over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold properties 50 years or lease period if less Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, ttings and equipment: Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Capital grants are treated as deferred income and are released to the profit and loss account over the estimated useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts in proportion to the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.

Pensions Dened benefit Schemes The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets in these financial statements.
The only significant dened benefit plans under FRS 17 are in the UK and comprise the Staff Pension Plan and the Retirement Cash Plan.
These plans have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures.
The most recent actuarial valuation at 1 April 2003 has been used and updated by our independent actuaries.

Pensions continued iv History of experience gains and losses 2003 2002 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount million 5.5 20.3 Percentage of scheme assets per cent 5.6 22.8 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount million 6.8 0.9 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities per cent 4.8 0.7 Total amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount million 0.3 23.6 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities per cent 0.2 18.0 The Group will be making additional annual pension contributions of 3.5 million commencing on 1 July 2004 in order to comply with the Minimum Funding Requirements for the UK dened benefit plans.
The above plans are funded and have full UK Inland Revenue tax-exempt approval by which benets are limited due to the statutory earnings cap an Inland Revenue limit on the amount of earnings that can be made pensionable under the plans for members who joined after May 1989.
Certain members, whose salaries are in excess of this cap, have had their benets increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of the basic salary only.
The Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benets itself and a provision at 31 December 2003 of 4.8 million 2002 4.3 million is included in the net pension liability above.
This represents the actuarial value, as confirmed by the Companys pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a Market Value basis in line with the Main Plan Valuation and adjusted each year by the charge for the year equivalent to a contribution to a funded plan of 0.2 million 2002 0.1 million and interest on the unfunded liability of 0.3 million 2002 0.3 million.
Of this liability 4.5 million 2002 4.1 million is in respect of Nicholas Brookes and is discussed below.
The additional death-in-service benets over the statutory cap are separately insured by the Company under an unapproved scheme.
Spirent has a contractual liability to pay Mr Brookes an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit UURB as agreed when he joined the Company in 1995.
At 31 December 2003 the provision in respect of this UURB stood at 4.5 million.
Conditionally upon him remaining in employment until 30 June 2004, Mr Brookes and the Company have agreed that he will commute all of his pension entitlement under the UURB in exchange for a lump sum payment of 3.7 million in cash, payable to him on 1 July 2004.
Dened Contribution Schemes United Kingdom The Group maintains dened contribution pension schemes for employees in the UK.
These plans are known as Cash Builder or Pension Builder and employer contributions into these schemes for 2003 were 0.1 million 2002 nil.
United States The Group maintains dened contribution pension benefit plans for employees of its US subsidiaries.
These plans, also known as 401 k plans, allow employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
There are five different 401 k plans within the US businesses and each of these plans has different features regarding Company contributions, maximum deferral percentages and investment choices.
The investment choices offered are among a selection of diversied mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate the Company contributions to the various US plans totalled $4.4 million for 2003 2002 $4.8 million.
Total assets in the dened contribution plans at the end of 2003 were $103.1 million 2002 $88.0 million.
There were no dened benefit plans in the US at 31 December 2003.
Other Jurisdictions Outside the UK and US employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations and these arrangements are dened contribution schemes.
Total contributions for 2003 in respect of these schemes amounted to 0.2 million 2002 0.1 million.
Total contributions to dened contribution schemes were 3.0 million 2002 3.6 million.
Taxation a Analysis of Charge for the Period 2003 2002 million million Current tax Corporation tax 4.8 Overseas taxation 4.9 4.4 Tax arising on disposals overseas taxation 3.0 Under over provision in prior years UK tax 1.1 1.3 overseas taxation 7.1 4.9 1.1 2.8 Share of joint ventures taxation 1.1 2.7 Share of associates taxation 0.9 0.6 Total current tax charge 0.9 0.5 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of timing differences 0.3 7.4 Reversal of deferred tax assets 19.0 Total deferred tax credit charge 0.3 26.4 Total tax charge for the year 0.6 26.9 The tax effect of the operating exceptional items was a tax credit of 1.7 million 2002 3.5 million credit.
In respect of the non-operating exceptional items no charge arises 2002 3.0 million charge.
An exceptional deferred tax charge of 19.0 million arose in the period to 31 December 2002, as previously recognised deferred tax assets were reversed due to insufficient evidence to support recognition of a deferred tax asset under FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
In 2003 12.6 million of deferred tax assets have been recognised on the pension fund deficit and credited to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In 2002 a charge of 5.4 million arises in the restated statement of total recognised gains and losses as the deferred tax asset, which would have previously been recognised on the pension fund deficit had FRS 17 Retirement Benets been implemented, has been written off due to the reasons discussed above.
Acharge of 0.1 million 2002 nil arises on the actuarial gain and this has been included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
b Factors Affecting Tax Charge for the Period The current tax charge for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30 per cent.
The differences are explained as follows: Restated 2003 2002 million million profit loss before tax 0.3 1,023.4 profit loss before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30 per cent 2002 30 per cent 0.1 307.0 Expenses not deductible for tax primarily goodwill impairment and amortisation 7.3 317.5 Movement in timing differences 0.3 7.4 Tax arising on disposals 3.0 Different tax rates on overseas earnings and other adjustments 0.8 0.6 Tax overprovided in previous years 6.0 6.2 Total current tax charge 0.9 0.5 46 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued 11.
Taxation continued c Factors that may Affect Future Tax Charges Deferred tax assets of 18.3 million 2002 20.1 million arising principally on timing differences in the US and UK have not been recognised.
These assets can only be realised when they reverse against suitable taxable profits.
Although the directors ultimately expect to realise these assets, there is currently insufficient evidence under FRS 19 Deferred Tax to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these timing differences.
In addition, the Group has tax losses arising in the US of 70.1 million 2002 23.1 million and in the UK of 24.8 million 2002 10.2 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is uncertain.
In total, deferred tax assets amounting to 50.3 million 2002 31.2 million have not been recognised on unutilised losses and timing differences.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Under FRS 17, three new items are included in the profit and loss account.
The full regular service cost of providing benets to employees in dened benefit schemes is included as an operating cost in the year together with the cost of providing benefit improvements in respect of past service and gains or losses arising on settlements or curtailments.
A credit for the expected return on the schemes assets and a charge for the increase during the year of the present value of the schemes liabilities because the benets are one year closer to settlement, is included as other finance expense in the profit and loss account.
Differences arising between the actual and expected returns on the schemes assets together with changes to the actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

The extent to which the schemes assets exceed or fall short of the schemes liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit on the balance sheet net of deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets were not recognised in 2002 as there was insufficient evidence at that time to support recognition under FRS 19 Deferred Tax.

Thecharge to pension costs would be 0.6 million higher in 2003 under the previous standard, SSAP 24, compared to FRS 17.
However, 1.5 million of the pension charge for 2003, which would have previously been included within operating costs, has been classied as other finance expense in the profit and loss account under FRS 17.
Investment in Own Shares The investment in own shares related to 3.5 million Ordinary shares 2002 3.5 million held by QUEST and 9.5 million Ordinary shares 2002 9.1 million shares held by the ESOT.
Shares held by QUEST will be used to satisfy options under the Companys Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
Shares in the ESOT are primarily held to hedge awards under the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP and provide awards under the Spirent Stock Option Plan SSOP.
The market value of own shares held in trust at 31 December 2003 was 7.6 million 2002 2.1 million.

At 25 February 2004, no purchases have been made or are contracted to be made under such authority.
In accordance with the rules of the following share schemes, options and purchase rights were exercised during the year which resulted in new Ordinary shares being allotted by the Company or existing shares being transferred from Spirent QUEST Limited as follows: Number of Consideration Ordinary shares received million 000 Executive Schemes Spirent Stock Option Plan 0.4 66.3 Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan 0.7 128.8 Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan 1 Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan 0.2 23.9 All Employee Share Schemes 3.3 471.5 4.6 690.5 Note 1 The exercise consideration for options under this plan is paid in US dollars and has been converted into sterling in the above table at an exchange rate of 1 $1.78, being the exchange rate on 31 December 2003.
During the year, no shares were transferred from Spirent QUEST Limited to option holders against the valid exercise of share options under the Companys UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
On 1 January 2004, 3.3 million Ordinary shares were allotted following the automatic exercise of purchase rights under the Companys US Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan.
Between 1 January 2004 and 25 February 2004 approximately 1.1 million Ordinary shares were allotted following exercises under other option schemes.
With the exception of the foregoing, there has been no material increase in the issued share capital, whether by exercise of options, purchase rights or otherwise, between the year end and 25 February 2004, the date on which these Accounts have been signed.
64 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued 32.
Capital and Reserves continued Share Option Schemes At 31 December 2003 the following options and purchase rights over Ordinary shares have been granted and remained outstanding under the Companys various employee share schemes.
Figures for the options outstanding and the exercise price per Ordinary share have each been adjusted, where relevant, for the 3:1 subdivision of share capital in 2000 and for the rights issues effected in 1993 and 2000.

These shares were originally purchased in the market to cover awards made under the Companys Long Term Share Purchase Plan and the SARP but the awardsrelating to the shares lapsed before exercise.
Although 6.1 million Ordinary shares are included above in the number of options outstanding, market-purchased shares held for the purpose of satisfying SSOP awards do not count towards the Companys overall dilution calculations.
2 Exercise prices per share for options under the Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan are denominated in US dollars and are expressed as US cents in the above table.
3 The Company has taken advantage of the exemption within Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes in accounting for all employee share schemes.
4 The exercise price and number of shares subject to the purchase rights outstanding cannot ultimately be determined until the maturity of each respective offering period ie normally 12 months following the date of grant.
The exercise price and number of purchase rights outstanding as shown above are based on the market price of an Ordinary share less the applicable 15 per cent discount at the date of grant.
a 1985 and 1995 Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS The Inland Revenue approved 1995 ESOS was introduced on the expiry of the 1985 ESOS and incorporates the guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI at that time.
It was subsequently amended by the Board to facilitate the award of unapproved share options both in the UK and overseas.
There are currently 593 participating executives in the ESOS.
Awards under the 1995 ESOS, normally determined annually, are at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive.
No price is payable on the grant of an option and no options have been, or can be, granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the 1985 and 1995 ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the 1995 ESOS are subject to the achievement of an earnings per share EPS performance condition before they can be exercised.
The condition is that over a period of three consecutive financial years, there has been an increase in the Companys headline EPS which is at least 6 per cent more than the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
All ESOS grants made after 11 May 2000 to the executive directors and senior management principally members of the Companys Operations Management Team are subject to enhanced performance conditions on exercise.
These are more fully explained in the Report on Directors Remuneration on pages 21 to 28.
The Remuneration Committee may in future impose different performance targets which they consider to be no less demanding.
Options granted under the 1985 ESOS are exercisable unconditionally.
Capital and Reserves continued b International Executive Share Option Scheme IESOS Certain US executives have previously been granted unapproved options under the IESOS with participation and awards being at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options are exercisable unconditionally and normally between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Again, no options have been granted at a discount to the market price.
The IESOS is closed and has been replaced by the unapproved arrangements to the 1995 ESOS referred to in a above.
c Spirent Stock Option Plan SSOP The SSOP was introduced following shareholder approval at the Companys 2000 Annual General Meeting AGM.
This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at selected employees in the Communications group with grants normally determined annually by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Under the SSOP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Options normally vest over four years, provided that the employee remains in employment.
The options become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis.
Any options not exercised will lapse on the seventh anniversary of grant.
No pre-exercise performance conditions attach to options granted under the SSOP.
Following an Extraordinary General Meeting EGM held in July 2003, shareholder approval was received for an Option Exchange Programme under which existing qualifying SSOP options with an exercise price of 140 pence per share or greater Underwater Options were exchanged for a reduced number of newly-issued options Replacement Options.
On 18 September 2003, the Company accepted for exchange 27.5 million Underwater Options in exchange for the grant of 4.9 million Replacement Options.
In accordance with the EGM authority, the exercise price per Ordinary share of a Replacement Option was 67.5 pence, being the fair market value of an Ordinary share on the date of grant plus 20 per cent of that market value.
In December 2003, the Remuneration Committee approved an annual grant of approximately 12 million options under the SSOP.
In accordance with the terms of the EGM circular, the exercise of options will be partially satisfied by using 6.1 million Ordinary shares which were previously marketpurchased and are currently held as unallocated by the Companys ESOT.
The remainder of the options will be satisfied by new-issued shares utilising a combination of existing share capital headroom and a limited use of headroom released through the Option Exchange Programme.
No further grants may be made under the SSOP after the 2004 AGM.
However, the Remuneration Committee is currently reviewing long term incentive arrangements, particularly for employees within the Communications group and these proposed arrangements will require shareholder approval.
d Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan NARSOP Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. Netcom in July 1999.
$44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding vested and unvested options over Netcom shares, primarily held by Netcom employees, into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary shares as adjusted on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the NARSOP.
The outstanding unvested options vested monthly from the date of acquisition during the remaining term of each individual grant and are not subject to any pre-exercise performance condition.
All remaining outstanding options under the NARSOP became fully vested and exercisable from July 2003 onwards until they expire.
e Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan ZARSOP Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation Zarak in November 2000, approximately 3.8 million shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary shares which will vest over a period expiring in 2004 on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the ZARSOP.
These options are primarily held by Zarak employees and have either a five or ten year life from the original date of grant.
Unvested rolled-over options are capable of immediate exercise ie prior to their respective vesting date and any shares arising from such an event are held in trust until the relevant vesting date.
The option holder is entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the shares whilst they are held in trust but they remain subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment is terminated prior to the vesting date.
f Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. Caw in August 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan.
The options and shares will vest over a period expiring in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the CARSP.
The options are held by Caw employees and have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 US cents is payable as each Ordinary share vests or upon the vesting of an exercised option.
66 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued 32.
Capital and Reserves continued Pursuant to individual agreements signed by participating Caw employees, any Ordinary shares issued under the CARSP are restricted until they have vested or are not at risk from forfeiture under the plan rules.
In accordance with the rules of the ESOS noted in a above, the Ordinary shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak, and Caw, or granted under the SSOP, do not count toward ABI scheme limits.
The plans mentioned in d to f above are now closed to new entrants and no further awards of options can be made under them.
g UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS The SRSOS is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and is open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Companys savings carrier to save a regular sum of between 5 and 250 per month for a xed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market price of an Ordinary share on the business day prior to the beginning of the Invitation Period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company has established an employee share ownership trust QUEST to honour the contractual commitment to deliver Ordinary shares against the valid exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS.
Spirent QUEST Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent plc, acts as sole trustee to the QUEST.
During the year no shares were transferred to participants.
Spirent QUEST Limited has waived all rights to receive dividends payable on its registered shareholding except for 0.01 pence per annum in aggregate and accordingly such shareholding is not included in the Companys EPS calculation as referred to in note 12. h US Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP The ESPP operates on a broadly similar basis to the SRSOS.
It enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent American Depositary Shares using proceeds of a savings contract.
When joining the ESPP, participants enter into a contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of $1,000 net per month, over a contract period of 12 months by way of regular payroll deductions.
No price is payable on the grant of a purchase right.
The purchase price will be based on the market value of an Ordinary share either on the first day of the Offering Period or on the last day of the Offering Period, whichever is lower, less a 15 per cent discount or, where shares are to be subscribed, their nominal value if greater.
i Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was approved by shareholders in 2001 and offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an opportunity to share in the Companys performance through share ownership.
The GAESPP was implemented in Canada in January 2002 and operates on similar terms to the ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 net per month.
The Company also operated the following incentive schemes during 2003, both of which utilised Ordinary shares purchased in the market ie they have not involved the issue of new shares.
No awards were made under either plan in the year to 31 December 2003. j Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom following the closure of the NARSOP described in d above and subsequently for certain other employees in the Communications group.
Under the SARP, recruitment, promotion and recognition awards over Ordinary shares have been made in line with historic and local competitive market practice on a quarterly basis at the discretion of a committee of senior executives.
The operation of the SARP reects as far as practicable the now closed NARSOP.
Accordingly, rights under the SARP vest over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Rights granted are not subject to the fullment of any pre-exercise performance conditions.
Capital and Reserves continued The SARP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary share over the rights price in the form of existing Ordinary shares which have been purchased in the market by the Companys ESOT.
The maximum number of shares over which SARP awards can be made is 5.25 million.
At 31 December 2003, the following rights were outstanding under the SARP: Rights price Number of rights outstanding Rights exercise dates pence million 10.09.0029.06.10 182416 3.0 k Long Term Share Purchase Plan LTSPP At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 2 May 2002, shareholders approved the future closure of the LTSPP and the substitution of further annual awards with a supplemental grant of options of equivalent value under the ESOS see a above.
Following a review of the LTSPP performance conditions see below, it was determined that the initial performance conditions for the remaining performance units had not been met and all remaining LTSPP performance units lapsed on 31 December 2003.
Grants under the LTSPP had a six year performance period comprising two periods of three years each.
Performance units, equivalent to shadow options, granted at the outset could only vest in the form of an award split between Ordinary shares and cash at the end of the first performance period.
This was provided that the challenging performance criteria of both total shareholder return TSR, as measured against a comparator group of companies or other relevant index, and real share price growth ie after taking ination into account had been met.
One-third of the award had to be retained in the form of Ordinary shares until the end of the second performance period.
These shares would have been matched on a ratio of two shares for every one share retained.
In order to encourage superior performance and to strengthen further the alignment of interest of participants with those of shareholders, participants may have chosen to invest some or all of their remaining cash award ie up to two-thirds of the award in shares and these would have been matched on a higher ratio of up to four shares for each one retained.
No reward under the LTSPP could have been made at the end of either performance period unless the Companys real share price growth was at least 5 per cent per annum and also its TSR performance ranked above the 60th percentile against the comparator group.
The Company established an ESOT as one method through which it could deliver Ordinary shares committed under the LTSPP with shares being held in trust prior to any vesting of awards.
No price was payable on the grant of a LTSPP performance unit and no performance units were granted at a discount to the market price.
At 31 December 2003, no performance units were outstanding under the LTSPP and the plan has now closed.
Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT At 31 December 2003 the ESOT held 11.2 million Ordinary shares to satisfy awards under various share based incentive schemes as described above.
Of this number, 1.3 million Ordinary shares were unconditionally vested at 31 December 2003.

A certain level of the earn-out targets has been achieved.
The amount of deferred consideration due is $10.0 million which the Company has elected to satisfy by the issue of new Ordinary shares.
These shares will be issued in 2004 with reference to an Ordinary share price of 120 pence in accordance with the terms of the agreement and with reference to the then prevailing US dollar to sterling exchange rate.

During the year the Group disposed of its Aviation Information Solutions businesses from within its Systems group and its interests in the WAGO joint venture.
70 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued 35.
US GAAP The Groups consolidated accounts are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from those generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
The following are the main differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP which are relevant to the Groups accounts.
In preparing the accounts for the current year the Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
The adoption of FRS 17 is a change in accounting policy and the comparative gures in the reconciliation of the net income loss under UK GAAP to US GAAP and the reconciliation of shareholders equity under UK GAAP to US GAAP have been restated accordingly.
Details of the effect of adopting FRS 17 on the UK GAAP accounts are set out in note 32.
UITF 38 requires that the cost of own shares, previously reported as a xed asset investment, be shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.
The adoption of UITF 38 has effectively eliminated a UK GAAP to US GAAP difference and again the comparative gures in the reconciliations have been restated accordingly.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Fixed Assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1998 was written off to retained earnings on acquisition.
In accordance with FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions subsequent to 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life which is dened as the period over which the value of the underlying business acquired is expected to exceed the values of its identiable net assets and is presumed to be limited to 20 years.
The estimated useful lives are between 10 and 20 years.
In reconciling to US GAAP, amounts of goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1998 written off to retained earnings on acquisition, have been capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, until 1 January 2002.
Under US GAAP, with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard FAS 142, effective 1 January 2002, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to periodic review for impairment.
Other intangible assets included in, and accounted for as, goodwill under UK GAAP, but reclassied as intangible assets under US GAAP, continue to be amortised over their individually determined estimated useful economic lives, subject to the provisions of FAS 141, which claries the criteria to recognise these intangible assets separately from goodwill, and FAS 144, which requires review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The Group considered these conditions to have been met at 30 November 2002 and obtained independent valuations for FAS 144 purposes which ultimately resulted in impairment of other intangible assets and goodwill within the Service Assurance division during 2002.
At 30 November 2003 independent valuations obtained by the Group did not indicate further impairment.
Under UK GAAP, FRS 10 requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Under US GAAP, FAS 142 requires periodic review of goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis.
The Group identied its reporting units for FAS 142 purposes and obtained independent valuations at 30 November 2002 and 30 November 2003.
These valuations resulted in impairment of goodwill in the Performance Analysis division during 2002, in addition to the impairment in the Service Assurance division under FAS 144.
No further impairment arose as a result of the valuations performed at 30 November 2003.
Under UK GAAP, impairment charges on goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded as an increase in accumulated amortisation.
Under US GAAP, impairment charges are recorded as a reduction in cost.
The presentation of goodwill and intangible assets within the reconciliation of shareholders equity reects this classication difference.
Stock-based Compensation UK corporate governance recommends the inclusion of performance criteria in UK discretionary or executive share plans.
Accordingly, the UK Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS includes certain performance criteria which give rise to variable plan accounting under US GAAP.
Notwithstanding these performance criteria, under UK GAAP no compensation expense arises under the Groups various share option plans, with the exception of the Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP.
In reconciling to US GAAP, the Group has elected to use the intrinsic value basis of calculating compensation expense for the ESOS, as set forth in Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB 25, determined by reference to Spirents share price at each reporting date.
An expense also arises under US GAAP in respect of the CARSP and the Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan, based on the intrinsic value of unvested stock awards at each reporting date and at the date of acquisition, respectively, recognised over the remaining future vesting period.
Disposal of Operations The different treatment of goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1998 under UK GAAP and US GAAP, together with the use of different goodwill amortisation periods and the adoption of FAS 142, result in adjustments to the profit or loss on disposal of businesses as the determination of the profit or loss on disposal takes into account the unamortised balance of goodwill released.
In addition, differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP as described in this note including stock-based compensation and derivative financial instruments may also affect the carrying value of the disposed subsidiary, resulting in a different profit or loss on disposal.
Under US GAAP, the profit or loss on disposal is also stated net of any related cumulative currency retranslation differences and the effect of pension curtailment under FAS 88.
US GAAP continued Pensions Under UK GAAP, the Group has fully adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets in the accounts for the year to 31 December 2003.
This is a change in accounting policy and results in a restatement of the previous years accounts as described in note 32.
The assets of the Groups significant dened benefit schemes are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of the schemes measured using the projected unit method.
The extent to which the schemes assets exceed fall short of the schemes liabilities is shown as a surplus deficit on the balance sheet net of deferred tax.
A credit for the expected return on the schemes assets and a charge for the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities are included in other finance expense in the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the projected benefit obligation is matched against the fair value of the pension plans assets and adjusted to reect any unrecognised obligations or assets in determining the pension cost or credit for the year.
Recognition of an additional minimum liability is required if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets.
Vacation Accrual An accrual is made under UK GAAP in respect of certain subsidiaries for vacation earned but not taken at the year end.
Under US GAAP, this accrual must be calculated to include all subsidiaries within the Group.
Derivative Financial Instruments Under UK GAAP, the fair value of the Groups financial instruments are not reported on the Group balance sheet and the gain or loss arising is reported in earnings as the instrument crystallises.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with FAS 133, the fair value of all derivative financial instruments must be recorded as part of shareholders equity.
As none of the Groups derivative financial instruments have been designated as hedges under FAS 133, any changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument must be reported through net income.
Investment in Joint Venture Under UK GAAP, the Groups interests in its interconnection joint venture, WAGO, at 31 December 2002 were accounted for using the gross equity method which required the Group to recognise its share of the gross assets and liabilities, offset by minority interest, and certain components of income and expenses of the joint venture in the Groups consolidated accounts.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with APB 18, the Groups interests in its joint venture were accounted for under the equity method which only required the Group to recognise its share of the after tax profits or losses of the joint venture.
Therefore, in reconciling to US GAAP, it was necessary to adjust for the Groups share of any differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP with respect to the after tax profits and the shareholders equity of the joint venture.
The only differences arising related to stock-based compensation and the application of FAS 133 in the joint ventures US GAAP basis financial statements.
The Group disposed of its interests in WAGO during 2003.
Deferred Taxation Under UK GAAP, the Company provides for deferred tax in accordance with FRS 19 on all timing differences with the exception of gains on revaluations of xed assets or where potentially taxable amounts have been rolled over where there is no commitment to dispose of the relevant asset.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which to offset the timing differences.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided on a full liability basis on all temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the Groups assets and liabilities.
Under UK GAAP, a deferred tax asset arises in respect of the pension fund deficit calculated in accordance with FRS 17.
Similarly, under US GAAP, a deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the additional minimum liability, which arises under FAS 87.
However, under UK GAAP, the pension fund deficit is shown net of the deferred tax asset on the balance sheet, whereas under US GAAP the deferred tax asset is shown separately to the additional minimum liability.
The presentation of the pension and deferred tax adjustments within the reconciliation of shareholders equity reects this classication difference.
72 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued 35.
US GAAP continued Unamortised Debt Issue Costs Under UK GAAP, debt issue costs are shown as a reduction in the associated capital proceeds and amortised over the life of the related debt.
Under US GAAP, these costs are disclosed as a separate asset and similarly amortised.
