The 2003 Pro Forma Profit and Loss Accounts and segmental information for the Group is prepared to illustrate the effect had the MIM Group acquisition occurred on 1 January 2003.
The financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2003 of the MIM Group has been presented at spot foreign currency exchange rates by reversing the realised hedging losses as the hedge book was at the money on the acquisition date.
The 2002 Pro Forma Profit and Loss Accounts and segmental information for the Group is prepared to illustrate the effect had the IPO, Rights Issue, coal and MIM Group acquisitions occurred on 1 January 2002.
The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2002 figures has been extracted from the supplementary prospectus for the recommended acquisition of MIM Holdings Limited and rights issue dated 17 April 2003 and amended as follows: i Hedging gains and losses are included within unallocated turnover by the MIM Group so the US$167 million fair value hedge book provision release has been reclassified to unallocated turnover.
Realised hedging losses for the year ended 31 December 2002 totalled US$119 million.
ii Silver loan financing costs of US$11 million were transferred from the EBITDA and EBIT of the Zinc Lead commodity stream in the supplementary prospectus.
These costs were included within unallocated by the MIM Group and are now transferred from EBITDA and EBIT unallocated costs to interest expense in the 2002 comparatives.
iii The MIM Groups financial year end was 30 June whilst Xstrata plc has a calendar year end.
When reporting the segmental financial information during the year ended 30 June 2002, the MIM Group inconsistently reported the Copper operating profit between the interim and full year results.
This resulted in the Copper EBITDA and EBIT being overstated and unallocated being understated by US$27 million for the year ended 31 December 2002 in the supplementary prospectus.
iv Ravenswood has been classed as an asset held for re-sale, consequently it has been removed from the consolidated results.
v Various operations have been re-classified to business segments and Technology reported separately in 2002 from unallocated to allow comparability with the 2003 segmental analysis presentation.
vi The attributable net assets of the MIM Group have been adjusted to be consistent with UK GAAP so that tax balances, project debt and outside equity interests are included whilst Group balances are excluded.
vii Treatment and refining charges have been netted against gross turnover to allow comparability to the presentation in the statutory financial statements.
This resulted in a reduction of turnover by US$167.0 for the year ended 31 December 2002 in the supplementary prospectus.
