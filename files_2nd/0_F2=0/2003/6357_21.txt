Contributions made to dened contribution schemes, including the contracted-in dened contribution scheme which is the main scheme for new UK employees, and to foreign schemes totalled 9.2m 2002: 5.4m.
The groups principal scheme, which operates in the UK, is of a dened benefit structure.
The assets of the dened benefit scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
The pension costs are assessed on the advice of a qualied independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The contributions paid into the UK dened benefit scheme constitute the cost recognised in the profit and loss account and amounted to 6.6m 2002: 6.5m together with 4.8m 2002: 5.5m contributed by the Distribution joint venture up to the date of the disposal of the groups interest.
Regular actuarial assessments of the scheme are carried out, the latest being at 5 April 2003, and updated to 30 September 2003.
The most significant actuarial assumptions used were that the long-term composite rates of return on investments would be 2.4% above the risk-free return, 2.4% above the rate of annual salary increase and 4.4% above the rate of pension increase.
As at 30 September 2003 the market value of the scheme assets was 602m.
This is in excess of the assessment of the schemes liabilities on a current funding level basis the Minimum Funding Requirement solvency level, being based upon pensionable service to and pensionable earnings at 30 September 2003.
The scheme has therefore been certied by an independent actuary as meeting the Minimum Funding Requirement solvency level.
The assets comprise 97% of the schemes liabilities on actuarial assumptions which take account of future service and earnings increases.
Variances arising on the actuarial valuation of the dened benefit scheme will be reviewed regularly and, in accordance with SSAP24 Pension costs, recognised in the profit and loss account over the average remaining service lives of the schemes members.
An additional cash contribution of 5m before tax has been made in the year commencing 1 October 2003, with no profit and loss account impact.
The contribution rate for the year commencing 1 October 2003 has been increased from 12% to 14% of pensionable earnings in respect of future service benets.
FRS17 Retirement benets was issued by the Accounting Standards Board in November 2000 but is not fully mandatory until the accounts for the year ended 30 September 2006 and some of its requirements may alter in the process of the harmonisation of UK and international accounting standards.
Prior to this the transitional arrangements are to disclose certain items by way of note.
The major assumptions for the UK dened benefit pension scheme valuation in accordance with the methodology prescribed by FRS17 are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.70 4.25 4.50 Rate of increase in pension payment 2.70 2.25 2.50 Discount rate 6.20 5.40 6.00 Ination assumption 2.70 2.25 2.50 50 Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 4 Staff costs and employees continued On full compliance with FRS17, the amounts which would have been charged to the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses for the year, on the basis of the valuation assumptions made as at the previous year end, including the groups share of the Distribution joint venture up to the date of the disposal of the groups interest, are as follows: 2003 2002 m m profit on ordinary activities before interest and taxation Current service cost 9.3 10.5 Past service cost 24.0 Curtailment gain 32.0 1.3 10.5 Financial items Expected return on scheme assets 36.0 34.2 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 40.0 34.7 4.0 0.5 Total included within profit before taxation 5.3 11.0 Statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 44.1 79.3 Experience gains losses on scheme liabilities 0.3 4.5 Changes in assumptions in valuation of scheme liabilities 33.0 55.5 Total actuarial gain loss 77.4 139.3 Difference between expected and actual return on scheme assets as a percentage of scheme assets % 7.3 16.9 Experience gains losses on scheme liabilities as a percentage of scheme liabilities % 0.7 Total actuarial gain loss as a percentage of scheme liabilities % 10.5 20.3 The market value of assets in the UK dened benefit scheme at 30 September 2003, the comparative numbers for 2002 and 2001 including the groups share of the Distribution joint venture and the expected rates of return are as follows: 2003 2003 2002 2002 2001 2001 m % m % m % Equities 413.1 8.0 263.3 8.0 351.5 7.0 Bonds 188.9 5.5 204.7 5.4 221.5 6.0 Total market value of assets 602.0 468.0 573.0 Actuarial value of liability 737.0 686.0 650.0 deficit in the scheme 135.0 218.0 77.0 Related deferred tax asset 40.5 65.4 23.1 Net pension liability 94.5 152.6 53.9 Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 51 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 4 Staff costs and employees continued The analysis of the movement in the scheme deficit during the year calculated in accordance with FRS17 is as follows: 2003 2002 m m deficit at 1 October 2002 218.0 77.0 Current service cost 9.3 10.5 Past service cost 24.0 Curtailment gain 32.0 Contributions 10.9 9.3 Expected return on scheme assets 36.0 34.2 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 40.0 34.7 Actuarial gain loss 77.4 139.3 deficit at 30 September 2003 135.0 218.0 FRS17 species that pension liabilities should be discounted at an appropriate high quality corporate bond rate.
At 30 September 2002, the rate used was the then median AA corporate bond rate.
The directors consider that it is more appropriate to apply the AA corporate bond rate which most closely approximates to the timescale of the liability prole and the asset portfolio of the scheme and have therefore used such a rate, being 6.2%, at 30 September 2003.
Upon the sale of the groups 50% interest in the Distribution joint venture the liabilities in respect of the employees of the joint venture became the full responsibility of the group pension scheme, giving rise to a past service cost of 24.0m, but reduced by 32.0m as those employees became deferred rather than active members of the group scheme.
The UK dened benefit scheme is largely closed to new members.
Under the projected unit method of actuarial valuation prescribed by FRS17 the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
If the pension scheme deficit calculated as above in accordance with FRS17 had been recognised in the financial statements, the groups net assets and profit and loss account reserve would have been disclosed as follows: 2003 2002 m m Net assets excluding pension deficit 269.7 272.3 Pension deficit net of deferred tax 94.5 152.6 Net assets including pension deficit 175.2 119.7 profit and loss account reserve excluding pension deficit 171.3 174.9 Pension deficit net of deferred tax 94.5 152.6 profit and loss account reserve including pension deficit 76.8 22.3 d Emoluments of the directors of Securicor plc: 2003 2002 000 000 As executives 1,195 2,380 As directors 408 384 Total directors emoluments excluding employers pension scheme contributions 1,603 2,764 The remuneration of the highest paid director Mr Buckles was 425,206 2002, Mr Wiggs: 995,266.

16 Financial instruments Financial instrument disclosures made in respect of net borrowings note 15, excluding short-term debtors and creditors as permitted under FRS13 Derivatives and other financial instruments, are as follows: Currency risk The group conducts business in many currencies and publishes its financial statements in sterling.
It is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to uctuations in the translation into sterling of its foreign net assets by holding borrowings in foreign currencies.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net borrowings are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match exchange differences on foreign currency equity investments, in accordance with SSAP20 Foreign currency translation.
At 30 September 2003, the groups US dollar and euro net assets after the impairment of goodwill in respect of the US aviation security activities before net borrowings were approximately 120% and 100% hedged by net borrowings respectively.
60 Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 16 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk and within this category of market risk is most vulnerable to changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of xed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the directors, primarily by utilising interest rate swaps and, where appropriate, forward rate agreements to manage short-term interest rate exposures.
At 30 September 2003 the group had no existing swaps or forward rate agreements.

Borrowings on the facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates, dependent on the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin.
The committed bank facilities are subject to financial covenants and any non-compliance with covenants may lead to an acceleration of maturity.
The group was fully in compliance with its financial covenants throughout the years to 30 September 2003 and 30 September 2002.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a year-end comparison of fair and book values of all the groups financial instruments by category.

Argenbright was responsible for passenger checkpoint security screening for two of the ights involved in the terrorist atrocities of 11 September 2001, being the United Airlines ight from Newark to San Francisco and the American Airlines ight from Washington to Los Angeles.
The hijacked planes performing these ights crashed respectively in rural Pennsylvania and into the Pentagon, Washington.
The directors believe that, in respect of those two ights, Argenbright carried out its security screening services properly and in accordance with its contractual and regulatory duties and that it should have no liability for the losses that occurred subsequently.
However, the events of 11 September were so extraordinary that it is impossible at this stage to state with certainty that no findings against Argenbright will be made.
Argenbright, which is a stand-alone limited liability corporation, is being sued and a number of lawsuits have been served upon it.
Securicor plc itself has been named in some of the lawsuits.
At 11 September 2001, Argenbright and the company had in place joint aviation liability insurance which included cover for acts of terrorism and which provided insurance cover of US$1bn for each of the two ights referred to above.
The directors are confident that, if there were to be awards of damages against Argenbright, they would be below the limits of the available insurance.
Additionally, contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements entered into in the normal course of business.
