47 GKN plc 2003 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting These accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards.
The Directors have conducted a review of the Groups accounting policies and have confirmed that they are the most appropriate for the purposes of giving a true and fair view of the Groups results and that there have been no changes from last year.
Basis of consolidation The group accounts consolidate the accounts for the year to 31 December 2003 of the Company and its subsidiaries unless those subsidiaries are subject to severe long-term restrictions on the ability of the Group to control them.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss accountfrom the date of acquisition or to the date of disposal.
In the case of acquisitions during the year the acquisition method of accounting is used.
Where material, profits or losses are analysed as discontinued operations where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which the accounts are approved.
Where businesses are treated as sold or closed in the current year, the prior years analyses are restated to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
Foreign currencies The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated to sterling at average exchange rates.
Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the appropriate forward contract rate or, if not covered, at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on revenue transactions are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
The exchange rates used for the currencies most important to the Groups operations are: 1 euro 1 US$ 2003 average 1.45 1.64 2002 average 1.59 1.50 2003 year-end 1.42 1.79 2002 year-end 1.53 1.61 Financial instruments The Groups accounting policy for derivatives is to recognise in the group profit and loss account gains and losses on hedges of revenues or operating payments only as they crystallise.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks and hedge a proportion of its investment in overseas subsidiaries and investments denominated in foreign currencies, where such hedging can be carried out on an economically acceptable basis.
Such financial instruments are treated as hedges against the underlying assets or liabilities, with matching accounting treatments and cash flows.
All gains or losses are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses until the instrument and the underlying hedged investment are sold, when the profit or loss arising is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Interest differentials resulting from the use of financial instruments to hedge these exposures are dealt with in the group profit and loss account.
Any instruments no longer designated as hedges are restated at market value and any gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account.
The book values of short-term debtors and creditors are the same as their fair values and have been excluded from the financial instrument disclosures other than those on currency exposures.
Sales Sales shown in the profit and loss account exclude value added taxes and, except in the case of long-term contracts in the AgustaWestland joint venture, represent the invoiced value of goods and services charged to external customers.
Invoices are raised when goods are despatched to the customer unless other terms have been specifically agreed.
On long-term contracts in AgustaWestland, sales are based on the estimated sales value of work done at the achievement of predetermined milestones.
48 GKN plc 2003 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Research and development costs Except as noted below, revenue expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred.
On major aerospace contracts that demonstrablyhave a life of more than ten years, net non-recurring initial costs consisting of design, development and tooling are categorised as stocks and are amortised over a maximum period of ten years from the start of serial production.
On other contracts, design and development costs are written off as incurred and tooling over three years.
Reorganisation costs Costs of reorganisation and redundancy, which are not part of a fundamental restructuring, are charged against operating profit in the period when the announcement is made.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed prior to 31 December 1997 has been eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after that date is capitalised as a fixed asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the value in use, determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows, goodwillis written down to the value in use and an impairment charge is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Where an acquired business is sold and goodwill has been previously deducted from reserves, the goodwill is taken into account in calculating the profit or loss on sale.
Tangible fixed assets Cost Tangible fixed assets are valued at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use but excludes interest.
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at 23 March 2000, the date of implementation of FRS 15, these values have been retained as book values in accordance with the transitional arrangements of that standard.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress.
Transfers are made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
In the case of buildings, computers and contract specific plant, depreciation is provided on valuation or original cost.
For all other categories of asset, depreciation is provided on the written down value at the beginning of the financial year.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are: Straight Reducing line balance %% Freehold buildings 2 General plant, machinery, fixtures, fittings and equipment 10 to 20 10 to 35 1 Computers and major software 20 to 33 3 Commercial vehicles and cars 40 to 45 Leasehold properties are amortised by equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets Where fixed assets are financed by leasing arrangements which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and capital which reduces the outstanding obligation.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred over the lease term.
Joint ventures and associated companies Joint ventures, although not subsidiaries, are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to share control with its partners under a contractual arrangement.
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence through its representation on the board of directors.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for in accordance with FRS 9 whereby the profit and loss account includes, at the appropriate line, the Groups share of their sales, operating profit, exceptional items, interest and tax.
They are stated in the balance sheet at the Groups share of their equity.
Where the size criteria of FRS 9 are met additional information is given by way of note to the accounts.
49 GKN plc 2003 Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, due allowance being made for obsolete or slow-moving items.
Cost includes the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Taxation Provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arises as a result of transactions that have occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in future, or a right to pay less tax in future.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it may be regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are not discounted.
No provision is made for any additional tax which might arise on remittance of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where distribution of such profits is planned.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is calculated, in accordance with SSAP 24, by independent actuaries as being the expected cost of providing pensions on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which the Group expects to derive benefit from the employees services.
Additionally, certain amounts are charged in accordance with the rules of defined contribution pension plans.
The impact on the balance sheet, profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses of the adoption of FRS 17, together with the assumptions made in computing that impact, are shown by way of note.

51 GKN plc 2003 4 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 2003 2002 m m a Operating exceptional items Asset impairments 14 Redundancy costs 15 Other 8 37 Operating exceptional items in 2002 arose from the substantial downturn in civil aviation markets and uncertainties surrounding North American vehicle production levels which were apparent in the second half of 2001, as a result of which the Group took steps to reduce capacity in a number of Aerospace and Automotive plants.
A reassessment was also made of the carrying value of certain Aerospace assets.
These actions resulted in a charge to operating profit of 106 million in 2001 and a further 37 million in 2002 in respect of actions which had not been announced by 31 December 2001 and could not, therefore, be accrued.
The cash outflow from these and earlier actions was 13 million in 2003, 52 million in 2002 and 27 million in 2001.

In 2003 a new wholly-owned subsidiary, GKN Aerospace Services Structures Corp. was formed.
This US corporation operates under a proxy agreement with the United States Department of Defense developing high technology, classified products for the Joint Strike Fighter.
The agreement places significant restrictions on the Groups management of the business for the life of the contract so that, in accordance with FRS 2, it has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment.
The amount of the investment has been fully provided so that the carrying value is nil.
At 31 December 2003, the excluded net liabilities were 1 million and the operating loss was 2 million.

20 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The disclosures made in notes 20 and 21 should be read in conjunction with the discussion of the Groups objectives, policies and strategies with regard to financial instruments in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 29 and 30.
Short-term debtors and creditors arising directly from the Groups operations are excluded from the following disclosures other than those on currency exposures.
After taking into account the various interest rate and forward foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group, the effective currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings were as follows: Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Weighted average time Floating rate Fixed rate Total average for which rate borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate is fixed m m m % Years At 31 December 2003 Sterling 9 702 711 7.0 11.9 US dollar 28 28 4.3 10.5 Euro 90 1 91 0.3 6.7 Other 92 2 94 4.5 219 705 924 6.9 11.9 At 31 December 2002 Sterling 22 702 724 7.0 12.9 US dollar 43 1 44 5.1 9.4 Euro 68 1 69 0.3 7.7 Other 101 1 102 3.5 234 705 939 6.9 12.9 The interest rates on floating rate borrowings are determined by reference to applicable LIBORs.
59 GKN plc 2003 The maturity of the Groups borrowings at 31 December 2003 was as follows: 2003 2002 m m Bank loans, overdrafts and other borrowings repayable as follows: Within one year 36 43 One to two years 12 10 Two to five years 175 149 After five years 685 718 908 920 Finance leases repayable as follows: Within one year 1 2 One to two years 2 1 Two to five years 1 3 After five years 12 13 16 19 Total borrowings 924 939 At 31 December 2003 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities: 2003 2002 m m Expiring within one year 32 57 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years Expiring in more than two years 614 560 646 617 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS a Financial assets Bank and cash Short-term loans balances and deposits 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Sterling 30 21 20 US dollar 8 30 Euro 19 16 2 3 Other 34 23 17 13 91 69 40 36 The bank and cash balances comprise 20 million 2002 26 million in respect of short-term balances earning interest and 71 million 2002 43 million in respect of balances which are non-interest earning.
The weighted average interest rate at year-end on the interest earning cash balances, which was all floating and set by reference to relevant LIBORs, was 2.6% 2002 3.5%.
Surplus cash is deposited for short-term periods typically with a maturity of less than three months.
The weighted average interest rate on the deposit account balances is 3.2% 2002 3.2%.
b Currency exposures As explained in the Operating and Financial Review on page 30, the Groups objective in managing the translational currency exposures arising from its overseas investments is to ensure that changes in the sterling equivalent of assets and liabilities caused by currency movements do not have a material impact on the sterling value of shareholders equity.
At 31 December 2003, there were 597 million of indirect borrowings created through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge such exposures denominated in euro 36% and US dollars 64% mirrored by indirectly created sterling deposits.
Net gains and losses arising from these translational currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Interest differentials resulting from the use of financial instruments to hedge those exposures are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
After taking into account the effects of forward foreign exchange contracts, at 31 December 2003 there were no material currency exposures that give rise to gains or losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
60 GKN plc 2003 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED c Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The comparison of book and fair values of all the Groups financialassets and liabilities at 31 December 2003 is set out below: 2003 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Bank and cash balances 91 91 69 69 Short-term loans and deposits 40 40 36 36 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 36 36 43 43 Long-term borrowings 872 933 877 901 Finance leases 16 16 19 19 Financial instruments held to manage interest rate and currency exposures Interest rate swaps and similar instruments 1 2 Forward foreign exchange contracts 88 5 Financial instruments held to hedge currency exposures on expected future trading transactions Forward foreign exchange contracts 6 At 31 December 785 839 834 851 In addition to the above, the Group has a loan to another company, shown within long-term debtors, with a book value of 15 million and fair value of 16 million.
The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair values for financial instruments: Short-term borrowings, cash and deposits approximate to book value due to their short maturities.
Long-term borrowings: Bank and other loans carrying fixed rates of interest the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2003.
Bonds quoted closing market value.
Interest rate instruments discounted cash flow analysis based on interest rates derived from market yield curves.
Forward exchange contracts and currency swaps marked-to-market.
d Hedges As explained in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 29 and 30, the Groups policy is to hedge the exposures summarised below.
Translational currency exposures are hedged where the costs and results of such hedging are economically acceptable.
Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, swaptions and forward rate agreements.
Transactional and translational currency exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Gains or losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for hedging both transactional and translational currency exposures and the movements therein, are as follows: Net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 39 32 7 Gains and losses from previousyears recognised in 2003 32 20 12 Gains and losses arising before 1 January 2003 that were not recognised in 2003 7 12 5 Gains and losses arising in 2003 that were not recognised in that year 36 24 12 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 43 36 7 Expected to be recognised in 2004 27 20 7 Expected to be recognised after 2004 16 16 43 36 7 In 2003 net translational gains and losses arising on forward foreign exchange contracts have been recognised through reserves and matched with offsetting movements on translational foreign exchange variances.
Gains of 5 million arising in prior years have been recognised in the profit and loss account in the year and have offset currency losses on underlying transactions.

No provision has been made for deferred tax in relation to gainsrecognised on revaluing assets to their market value or on the sale of assets where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into the cost of replacement assets.
Such tax would only become payable if assets were sold without it being possible to roll over any resultant gains.
The total amount unprovided for is 15 million 2002 9 million.
It is not anticipated that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax which might arise on the remittance of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where the distribution of such profits is planned.
Post-retirement Post-retirement includes provisions relating to pension benefits of 176 million 2002 175 million and provisions for other post-retirement benefits of 57 million 2002 55 million.
Other Other provisions comprise mainly legal and other claims, environmental and warranty provisions, the timing of which is inherently uncertain.
They are established based on historical information or professional assessment.

The contribution to group cash flow was a net cash inflow of 3 million from operating activities, payments of nil in respect of interest, payments of nil in respect of tax and payments of 1 million in respect of capital expenditure and financial investment.
26 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK, pension arrangements are made through an externally funded defined benefit scheme.
An independent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at April 2003 using the projected unit method.
The market value related basis assumed a yield pre-retirement of 7.5% per annum, which exceeded the annual rate of increases in pensionable salaries by 3.4% 2.65% in respect of future service with a yield post-retirement of 5% per annum 4.75% in respect of future service, which exceeded pension increases by 2.4% 2.15% in respect of future service.
The aggregate market value of the assets at the valuation date was 1,297 million and the aggregate funding level on an ongoing basis was 69%.
Company contributions in the year to the UK scheme totalled 54 million 2002 33 million compared with the regular cost in accordance with the application of SSAP 24 of 10 million 2002 11 million.
The total charge to operating profit was 33 million 2002 17 million.
There were no curtailment costs charged against exceptional items in respect of closure of businesses 2002 3 million.
A cumulative advance payment of 93 million is included in long-term debtors 2002 72 million.
In certain overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The annual charge to provide for these obligations, which is determined in accordance with actuarial advice or local statutory requirements, amounted to 35 million 2002 31 million.
The Group operates a number of retirement plans which provide certain employees with post-retirement healthcare benefits.
The liability for providing these benefits is recognised on an actuarial basis and included in post-retirement and other provisions disclosed in note 22.
The principal actuarial assumptions for the main UK plan as at December 2000, the date of the last review, were that the discount rate would be 7% per annum and that medical costs would initially increase by 8% per annum for three years falling to 4.5% over the next five years.
The Group operates a number of small defined contribution schemes outside the United Kingdom.
The charge to the profit and loss account in the year was 4 million 2002 4 million.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date.
