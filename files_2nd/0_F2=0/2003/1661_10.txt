This exceptional charge is in addition to the termination provisions referred to in ii below and the net exceptional charge of 6,921,000: 4,405,000 made in the prior year.
b Restructuring costs of 25,941,000: 18,169,000 2002: 6,240,000: 3,946,000 have been incurred comprising: completion of a plan started in 2002 to reduce a number of management and support positions across Europe: completion of an integration and reorganisation programme following the acquisition of the Budget business in 2003 see Note 26 : commencement of a project to re-engineer finance and information technology back office activities, which is scheduled to complete in the next few years: and recognition of a restructuring charge relating to the curtailment of a major software development project.
This charge comprises the write off of previously capitalised development costs and other termination costs net of amounts recoverable from the disposal of certain intellectual property rights.
c Following a downturn in the profitability of two acquired companies in Germany and Holland, the Directors determined that the recoverable amount of these businesses was less than the carrying amount of their respective assets.
As a consequence, an impairment provision of 7,124,000: 5,003,000 2002: nil against AutoHof Bismark GmbH and 6,698,000: 4,704,000 2002: nil, against Avis Autoverhuur BV have been recognised to write down the value of these assets to their recoverable amounts, representing a full provision against goodwill.
d Other exceptional items comprise of a one off repayment of VAT in respect of earlier years 3,575,000: 2,553,000, which due to its nature has been treated as exceptional income, and the net amount received in resolving a dispute relating to the recoverability of certain amounts from a former re-insurer that arose in prior periods for which a provision of 3,273,000: 2,083,000 was made in 2002.
In addition to the above, exceptional interest income of 3,631,000: 2,593,000 2002: nil was received in respect of the aforementioned VAT repayment see Note 6.

As a consequence, the Group has recognised a provision for termination costs of 54,374,000: 38,186,000 comprising asset write offs, redundancies and other termination costs, including a goodwill write off of 31,836,000: 22,357,000. b As described in Note 26 to these Financial Statements, on 11 December 2003 the 50% interest in AutoCascade, a joint venture company, and the 10% interest in AutoBytel was sold for a combined loss of 568,000: 399,000.

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated after adjusting for goodwill amortisation and net exceptional items to highlight ongoing trading performance.
The Group has granted options to certain Directors and employees over ordinary shares of Avis Europe plc.
Such shares constitute the only category of potentially dilutive ordinary shares and these would have increased the weighted average number of shares in issue by nil in 2003 2002: 423,069.
These options had no impact on loss profit in either year.
In accordance with FRS 11, Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its fixed assets.
A review was undertaken at 31 December 2003 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the present value of future cash flows derived from assets using projections for each asset.
The discount rates for the markets reviewed were based on company specific pre-tax weighted average costs of capital and ranged from 9.5% to 10%.
As described in Note 3, impairment provisions of 7,124,000: 5,003,000 against AutoHof Bismark GmbH, 6,698,000: 4,704,000 against Avis Autoverhuur BV and 31,836,000: 22,357,000 against Centrus have been recognised to write down the value of these assets to their recoverable amounts, representing a full provision against goodwill.
As described in Note 3, the Group has completed an integration and reorganisation programme following the acquisition of the Budget business.
Post integration, cash flows of the Budget business are expected to improve significantly to 2008, but grow at more modest rates for a further four years thereafter, before reverting to the expected relevant country growth in nominal GDP.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to use projections in excess of five years when assessing the carrying value of these assets.
The results of the review indicated that no impairment provision was necessary in respect of the Budget business.

instruments, including derivatives, are detailed in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 10 and 11.
Amounts dealt with in this Note include cash, overdrafts, loan notes, commercial paper, deferred consideration and finance leases, but no other assets and liabilities.
Where applicable, amounts within this Note take account of interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
60,000,000 of the proceeds from the loan notes issued in July 2002 are swapped so as to generate a floating rate euro liability.
The floating rate financial liabilities principally comprise finance leases, bank loans and overdrafts bearing interest at various rates set with reference to the prevailing EURIBOR or equivalent.
Included in these floating rate amounts are borrowings subject to interest rate caps with an aggregate notional principal of 60,000,000: 42,157,000 2002: 60,000,000: 38,597,000.
The weighted average interest rate and the weighted average period of the fixed rate liabilities are as follows: 2003 2002 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average average period average average period fixed interest for which fixed interest for which rate rate is fixed rate rate is fixed %Years % Years Currency Euro 5.9 2.8 5.9 3.0 Sterling 6.5 4.5 6.8 1.7 5.9 3.0 5.9 2.9 Deferred consideration of 32,080,000: 22,540,000 2002: 35,244,000: 22,672,000 bears an interest rate of 8.0% 2002: 8.0% fixed for 34 years 2002: 35 years.
This sterling denominated amount has been excluded from the above analysis.
Excluded from the above tables are forward start interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and collars.
They have aggregate notional principals of nil 2002: 30,000,000 and 480,000,000 2002: 110,000,000, which commence in 2004 and 2006 2002: commencing in 2003 and 2004 and will run for between three months and four years 2002: between one and five years.
The swaps and forward rate agreements will convert the prevailing floating interest rate to an average fixed rate of 2.9% 2002: 5.2%.
The collars with a notional principal of 50,000,000 2002: nil will restrict the floating interest rate due to be paid to between 3.3% and 4.8%.
