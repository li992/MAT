42 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2003 1 Accounting Policies a Accounting convention Cairn prepares its accounts under the historical cost convention.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Cairns accounts fall within the scope of the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP issued by the Oil Industry Accounting Committee, Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and Decommissioning Activities and have been prepared in accordance with the provisions thereof.
c Basis of consolidation The scheme of arrangement to introduce a new holding company to the Group became effective on 19 February 2003 the scheme date.
Accordingly, Cairn Energy PLC CE PLC, formerly New Cairn Energy PLC became the ultimate parent company in the Group, having acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Cairn Energy Bangladesh Limited CEB, formerly Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn Energy Bangladesh PLC.
Upon the scheme becoming effective, CE PLC became the holding company of the Cairn Group, and all existing CEB shares 148,912,609 ordinary shares of 10p each having a total market value of 428.1m at a price of 287.5p per share on 19 February 2003, were cancelled and replaced with the same number of shares in CE PLC.
Under the scheme, CEB shareholders received the same number of shares having the same economic and voting rights in the new holding company, CE PLC, as they held in CEB.
On the scheme date CE PLC was admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities and CEB delisted on the same date.
On cancellation of the CEB shares on the scheme date, the share capital of CEB was restored to its former nominal amount and the credit of 14,891,260.90 arising in the books of CEB as a result of the cancellation was applied in paying up in full the CE PLC shares equal in aggregate nominal value to the aggregate nominal value of the shares cancelled.
The new CEB shares were then issued to CE PLC, the holding company of the Group, the result being CE PLC having an investment in CEB equating to the nominal value of the shares issued by CEB.
Shares in CE PLC were then issued to existing CEB shareholders.
The scheme of arrangement has been accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger accounting.
The consolidated accounts are presented as if the scheme of arrangement had been effected on 1 January 2002, and correspondingly the comparatives have been adjusted to reflect this change.
In the Balance Sheet comparatives, share capital has been restated to show share capital of the new holding company and the former CEB consolidated group combined equity shares: 14,891,261.90: non-equity shares: 49,999.00 and the share premium and capital redemption reserve of CEB have been reclassified as Other reserves in accordance with the principles of merger accounting.
The consolidated cash flow comparatives have also been restated to show the cash flows of the new holding company and the former group combined.
The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 December.
The consolidated profit and loss account and cash flow statement include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings up to the date of disposal.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities not accounted for under merger accounting on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
In accordance with FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised, classified as an asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, subject to review for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
No Company profit and loss account is presented, as provided by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. d Turnover Turnover represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production and tariff income, recognised on a direct entitlement basis.
43 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003 e Fixed assets Cairn follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets.
Under this method, all expenditure incurred in connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas assets is capitalised in two geographical cost pools: South Asia and North Sea.
This includes interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects.
The capitalisation of expenditure under each phase of the project ends on completion of that phase.
Acquisition, exploration and appraisal expenditure is capitalised as Exploration assets within the balance sheet.
Exploration assets expenditure is transferred to Development producing assets when the commercial reserves attributable to the underlying asset have been established.
Further expenditure on fixed assets in the production phase is capitalised where future economic benefit is enhanced.
Net proceeds from any disposal of oil and gas assets are credited against the previously capitalised costs.
In the case of disposal of an asset holding subsidiary, net proceeds represents the net book value of the assets sold together with the gain or loss arising on disposal of that subsidiary.
f Depletion, impairment and depreciation Depletion Cairn depletes expenditure on oil and gas production and development on a unit of production basis, based on proved and probable reserves.
Impairment Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
In such circumstances if the exploration asset has a corresponding development producing cost pool, then the exploration costs are transferred to that cost pool and are written off on a unit of production basis through the depletion charge.
Where there is no such development producing cost pool, the exploration costs are charged immediately to the profit and loss account.
Impairment reviews on development producing oil and gas assets are carried out from a geographical pool perspective, in accordance with FRS 11.
Each year, the net book value of the pool is compared with the associated discounted future cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the profit and loss account as impairment.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier year, that charge can be reversed in a later period to the extent that the discounted cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
Depreciation Fixed assets, other than oil and gas assets, are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Annual Rate % Depreciation Method Tenants improvements 10 - 33 straight line Vehicles, fixtures and equipment 25 - 50 straight line g Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within fixed assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is shown as the Decommissioning charge in the profit and loss account, and the unwinding of discount is included within Other finance costs - unwinding of discount in note 7.
44 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2003 h Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Cairn maintains the accounts of all overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches in US$, with the exception of certain Dutch companies which are recorded in Euros.
Cairn translates overseas subsidiary accounts using the closing rate method, whereby assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and profit and loss items are translated into Sterling at average rates for the year.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets and associated long term borrowings of overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to 1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December 2003 2003 2002 US$ 1.790 1.635 1.604 1.419 1.447 1.531 i Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
j Pension schemes Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
As required under Indian legislation, the Group also operates a defined benefit scheme for certain Indian employees.
Contributions are assessed annually for any surplus deficit in funding based on the annual actuarial valuation.
The scheme is funded to the required level at least annually.
On the grounds of materiality, contributions have been charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension charges are detailed in note 4. k Leasing commitments Cairn charges rental payable under operating leases to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
45 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003 l Share schemes The costs of awards to employees, in the form of shares or the rights to shares, under the LTIP are recognised over the period to which the employees performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares at the date of the award or at the date of purchase, where purchases have been made by the Cairn Energy PLC Employees Share Trust, and on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria will be met.

Turnover arises from oil, gas and condensate sales and tariff income.
Turnover by destination does not differ materially from turnover by origin.
The exceptional item within 2002 turnover 4.3m relates to a provision in respect of the share of petroleum allocated to the Indian Government in relation to the Ravva joint venture.
The other exceptional items within operating profit relate to the write-back down of oil and gas assets.
Interest receivable, interest payable and foreign exchange differences cannot be allocated specifically to the above geographic areas.
Oil and gas assets are analysed in notes 11 and 12.
The directors consider that the segmentation of other net operating assets into geographic areas is not practicable.

The difference is explained below: 2003 2002 Notes 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 69,087 43,804 Tax at weighted average rate of corporation tax of 20.60% 2002: 36.51% 14,232 15,992 Effects of: Permanent differences including tax holiday 1,383 621 Capital allowances for period in excess of depreciation 13,477 2,194 Other timing differences 1,981 903 Unrealised losses arising in the year not relievable against current tax 8 c 5,094 1,479 Creation of current year losses 3,724 Utilisation of losses 2,208 1,724 Payment of Minimum Alternate Tax 8 c 1,582 10,618 Total current tax charge 5,583 4,459 c Factors that may affect future corporate tax charges At 31 December 2003 Cairn had losses of approximately 11.3m 2002: Nil available for offset against future trading profits chargeable to UK Corporation Tax and surplus management expenses of 1.1m 2002: Nil available for offset against future investment income chargeable to UK Corporation Tax.
At 31 December 2003, Cairn had losses of approximately 9.1m 2002: 8.2m available for offset against future trading profits chargeable to Netherlands Corporate Income Tax but there are restrictions on the use of these losses.
Tax losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot usually be offset against profits arising in another jurisdiction.
Where losses arising in the year are not relievable against current tax, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
Cairn operates in countries where the tax rate is different to the UK Corporation Tax rate, e. g. India 41%.
In India, Minimum Alternate Tax MAT is payable instead of Corporate Income Tax CIT where MAT on accounting profits results in a higher liability than CIT on taxable profits.
In India, tax is calculated on a fiscal year basis so where MAT is due for one fiscal year and CIT for the next, the consolidated accounts will show both CIT and MAT in the same calendar year.
Cairn also has several group companies with Indian tax liabilities.
Cairn operates in countries where relief from tax on profits is available for a set period of time, known as a tax holiday.
In India, there is a tax holiday of seven years on profits from certain assets but the relief is restricted if, in the same company, there are losses from other assets in the same year.
Based on current expenditure plans, it is anticipated that tax allowances will continue to exceed the accounting depletion charge each year.
However the timing of related tax relief is uncertain.

19 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks.
Cairns strategy is to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Equity finance, project finance and other alternatives are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas development projects.
Cairns principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, investments, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for Cairns operations.
Cairn has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 13 for short term debtors and creditors.
They have, therefore, with the exception of the foreign currency risk disclosure, been excluded from the numerical disclosures.
Cairns treasury function is responsible for managing investment and funding requirements including banking and cash flow monitoring.
It must also recognise and manage interest and foreign exchange exposure whilst ensuring that Cairn has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet its cash requirements.
Cairn may from time to time, with the approval of the Board, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and movements in oil and gas prices.
It is however, and has been throughout the period under review, Cairns policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
58 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2003 19 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments continued The main risks arising from Cairns financial instruments are foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and liquidity risk.
The current policy for managing these risks is detailed below: Liquidity interest rate risk Cairn entered into new debt financing arrangements on 20 January 2004.
As a result the Group has $240m $40m seven year and $200m three year unsecured committed multi currency revolving credit facilities available under corporate bilateral agreements to fund its activities.
Revolving credit facilities give the Group flexibility to borrow and repay debt as and when appropriate.
When the Group has surplus cash it is placed on short term deposit, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its expenditure requirements.
Short medium term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates although there was no debt drawn at 31 December 2003.
Short term deposits are currently at floating money market interest rates.
Board approval is required for all new borrowing facilities over 5m.
Short term deposits held at 31 December 2003 12.1m are included within the floating rate financial assets.
Commodity price risk There are natural product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Ravva, Sangu and Lakshmi gas contracts.
The requirement for hedging instruments is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
No hedging contracts have been entered into during the year.
No outstanding hedging was in place at the start of the year or at the year end.
Foreign currency risk Although the Group reports in Sterling, a large proportion of its business is conducted in US$ with the majority of Cairn revenues being received in $ and a significant proportion of expenditure being incurred in $.
Cairn manages this, and other exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
Although the Groups commercial currency risk exposure is minimised through currency matching, movements in $ against Sterling can have a significant impact from a reporting perspective due to the underlying assets of the Group being $ denominated.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The $96.7m facilities $240m from 20 January 2004 are multi currency committed facilities, which allow drawdowns in $, Sterling or any other currency that is freely convertible and transferable into $.
At 31 December 2003 there was no debt drawn.
Exchange rates are monitored in conjunction with forecast currency requirements.
Currency exposures are shown in the table on page 61.
No forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into during the year.
There were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.

$96.7m of these facilities being three year with the remaining $53.3m being 364 day.
On 31 October 2003 Cairn allowed the 364 day facilities to expire without renewal leaving the three year facilities in place at 31 December 2003 to cover any short to medium term cash requirements pending negotiation of new increased facilities with a later expiry giving the Group increased financing flexibility.
Following discussions with a number of commercial banks and International Finance Corporation IFC, a member of the World Trade Bank who provide finance for projects in developing countries, $240m of new facilities were entered into on 20 January 2004.
The $96.7m facilities in place at 31 December 2003 were cancelled on the same date the new facilities came into effect.
There was no debt drawn under the $96.7m facilities when cancelled.
The new facilities are committed, unsecured, multi currency revolving credit facilities.
$200m are three year bilateral facilities provided by four commercial banks with an expiry date of 19 January 2007, and the balance of $40m is a seven year bilateral facility provided by IFC with an expiry date of 19 January 2011.
In addition, a $17m facility is in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees.

29 Contingent Liabilities a Ravva Arbitration Members of the Ravva joint venture are currently in dispute with the Indian Government GOI regarding the percentage share of petroleum allocated to the GOI in any year and how that percentage share is to be calculated.
The joint venture treatment of certain items in the calculation has been challenged by the GOI which has issued a demand notice superseding a previous demand notice of $452,959,637 of which Cairns share would be $100,017,335.
Cairn does not agree that the GOIs interpretation of the PSC is correct and has vigorously defended its position through the arbitration process.
Arbitration proceedings commenced in August 2002 and are still ongoing, with a hearing scheduled from 26 April 2004 onwards.
A provision of $6.9m was made in the 2002 accounts based on managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Based on an external risk assessment the current level of provision is considered adequate and no increase is deemed necessary at the year end.
Should the views of the GOI prevail on aspects in addition to these elements thought by management to be likely, the joint venture members could be required to make significant additional payments, as the GOIs share of petroleum for prior years could increase up to a maximum take of 60% per annum.
In addition, there is a potential impact on Cairns entitlement to reserves from Ravva going forward, which would result in an adjustment to depletion and abandonment calculations.
It is not possible at this stage to estimate what the impact might be and correspondingly no adjustments have been made.
b Texuna International Limited Cairn is currently involved in legal proceedings with Texuna International Limited in the High Court of Justice, Commercial Court in London in connection with an unsuccessful joint bid for a number of blocks in Turkmenistan.
Texuna are claiming reimbursement of $0.55m out of a sum of $1m drawn down by Cairn on a letter of credit provided by Texuna in connection with the joint bid.
The outcome of the claim depends upon the interpretation of a bidding agreement entered into between the parties.
In addition, Texuna are claiming damages of up to $121.1m for an alleged breach of the bidding agreement.
Cairns belief is that this claim is without merit and is being vigorously defended.
No provision for this has been made in the financial statements.
