Woolworths Group plc the Group came into existence on 28 August 2001 financial year 2002 following demerger from Kingsher plc Kingsher.

However, 2002 administrative expenses include central costs relating to the Groups Corporate Centre from the point of demerger.
A separate Company profit and Loss Account dealing with the results of Woolworths Group plc the Company has not been presented, as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Accounting Policies Accounting Conventions The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain land and buildings that are included in the financial statements at valuation, and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis for Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of attributable net assets at the date of acquisition.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Foreign Currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at contracted rates or, where no contract exists, at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at the year-end are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the profit and Loss Account.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets, which comprise goodwill arising on acquisitions and acquired licences and copyrights, are stated at cost less amortisation.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions is treated as an asset on the Balance Sheet and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life not exceeding 20 years.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill arising, account is taken of the nature of the business acquired, the stability of the industry, the extent of continuing barriers to market entry and expected future impact of competition.
With the exception of Streets Online Limited see note 4 all acquisitions are considered by the Directors to have an estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
Acquired licences and copyrights are amortised over the period of the underlying legal agreements, which do not exceed 20 years.
Depreciation Tangible xed assets are stated at cost valuation less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is provided where it is necessary to reect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Group.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is calculated by the straight-line method and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are: Freeholds 2 per cent Long leaseholds 5 per cent Short leaseholds over the life of the lease Tenants improvements shorter of the estimated useful life and the remaining life of the store lease Fixtures and ttings between 10 per cent and 15 per cent Computers and electronic equipment between 20 per cent and 50 per cent Motor cars 25 per cent 1 Commercial vehicles 33 3 per cent As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets the Group has adopted a policy of not revaluing freehold properties and previously revalued freehold properties are included at their valuation less accumulated depreciation.
30 Woolworths Group plc Notes to the Accounts continued Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill The need for any xed asset or goodwill impairment write down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value or value in use.
The value in use is determined from estimated discounted future cash ows.
Discount rates used are based on the circumstances of the individual businesses.
Disposal of Land and Buildings profits and losses on disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts.
Operating Leases All operating lease payments are charged to the profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Stocks Stocks, which solely comprise nished goods, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-down and shrinkage.
Rebates Receivable from Suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Pensions Companies within the Group offer either a dened benefit or a dened contribution scheme to employees.
In each case a separate fund is being accumulated and held in a separately administered trust to meet the actuarial liabilities.
The estimated costs of pensions in respect of the dened benefit scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so that they are spread over the working lives of employees.
Variations to pension costs arising at each actuarial valuation date caused by differences between the assumptions used and actual experience are spread over the average future working lifetime of employees.
Further details which also include the Groups adoption of the transitional arrangements for Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benets are provided in note 30.
Deferred Taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the full provision method in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Derivative Financial Instruments Financial assets are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premia are charged or credited to the profit and Loss Account over the life of the asset or liability to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for by using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
Where such instruments do not hedge an underlying asset or liability, they are accounted for using fair value accounting.
When a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the instrument will thereafter be marked to its fair value in the financial statements.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments for hedging purposes is recognised on an accruals basis, and credited or charged to the profit and Loss Account in the financial period in which it arises.
Gains or losses on financial instruments accounted for on a fair value basis are reected in the profit and Loss Account as they arise.
ESOP The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust.
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 13 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP have been included in the accounts of the Company.

Pension Costs On 1 April 2002 the Group established the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme a funded dened benefit scheme to replace the Groups participation in the Kingsher Pension Scheme KPS and the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust a dened contribution scheme to replace the Groups participation in the Kingsher Retirement Trust KRT.
Employees were invited to join these replacement schemes and existing Kingsher pension rights have been transferred across for those members who elected to do so.
Existing pensioners and deferred pensioners originating from the Group have remained with the relevant Kingsher scheme.
Woolworths Group Retirement Trust WGRT Payments to the WGRT are charged against profits as incurred.
The pension cost for this scheme, charged to the profit and loss account, is 0.6 million, reecting contributions paid to the WGRT since April 2002.
In addition, the Group paid 0.1 million, also charged to the profit and loss account, in respect of its participation in the KRT for February and March 2002.
Total payments to the KRT for the year ended 2 February 2002 were 0.6m.
Woolworths Group Pension Scheme WGPS Following the establishment of the WGPS on 1 April 2002, the Trustees of the Kingsher Pension Scheme transferred 131.4 million to the WGPS on 21 November 2002 in respect of the accrued benets in that scheme for WGPS members who had elected to transfer them.
Actuarial valuation Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The pension cost calculated in accordance with the SSAP 24 accounting standard has been assessed by independent actuaries, based on a valuation of the WGPS as at 1 April 2002 using the projected unit method and the following principal financial assumptions.
Price ination 2.8 Pay increases 3.8 Pension increases 2.7 Discount rate before retirement 7.25 Discount rate after retirement 6.0 Assets were taken at market value, 165.2 million, and represented 94.7 per cent of the value of the schemes liabilities after allowing for future pay increases.
The past service deficit on the SSAP 24 assumptions therefore amounted to 9.3 million.
This deficit has been amortised over the average future working lifetime of the schemes active members 8.4 years using the percentage of payroll method.
Following the results of the funding valuation, the Group agreed to contribute to the WGPS at a rate of 13.5 per cent of pensionable pay, backdated to 3 February 2002.
The Groups contribution rate will be reviewed at the next formal valuation, due no later than 1 April 2005.
Under SSAP 24 the pension cost for the year to 1 February 2003 is therefore 17.0 million, which is split into a regular cost of 15.7 million and a variation of 1.3 million.
During February and March 2002, the Group contributed to the KPS at the rate of 12.7 per cent of pensionable pay amounting to 2.3 million.
For the ten-month period to 1 February 2003 the Group contributed to the WGPS at the rate of 12.6 per cent of pensionable pay, amounting to 13.6 million.
Total contributions over the year therefore amounted to 15.9 million total contribution to the KPS over the year to 2 February 2002 amounted to 15.2 million.
The Groups funding policy differs from the accounting policy to the extent that different assumptions are used in setting the funding policy of the scheme.
The funding policy has been set using the following assumptions per annum : a discount rate for past service benets of 6.25 per cent, a discount rate for future service benets of 6.5 per cent, pay increases of 4.0 per cent, and price ination and pension increases of 2.5 per cent.
