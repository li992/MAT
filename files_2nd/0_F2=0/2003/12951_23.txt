Dilution and ore loss are incorporated into the calculation of Reserves.
Randgold Resources reports its Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC code.
The reporting of ore reserves is also in accordance with US Industry Guide 7.
Cautionary note to US investors: the United States Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC permits mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved and probable ore reserves.
We use certain terms in this annual report, such as resources that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in our filings with the SEC.
