736120cover 23 2 04 9:10 AM Page 2 Glossary Net asset value per share NAV This is the value of the Companys assets attributable to one ordinary share.
It is calculated by dividing shareholders funds by the total number of shares in issue.
For example, as at 31 December 2003 shareholders funds were 389,244,000 and there were 162,800,000 ordinary shares in issue: the NAV was therefore 239.09p per share.
Shareholders funds are calculated by deducting the Companys current and long-term liabilities and any provision for liabilities and charges from its total assets.
Discount Investment trust shares can frequently trade at a discount to NAV.
This occurs when the share price is less than the NAV and investors may therefore buy shares at less than the value attributable to them by reference to the underlying assets.
The discount is the difference between the share price and the NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.
For example, if the share price were 80p and the NAV 100p, the discount would be 20%.
Premium A premium occurs when the share price is more than the NAV and investors therefore would be paying more than the value attributable to the shares by reference to the underlying assets.
For example, if the share price were 120p and the NAV were 110p, the premium would be 9.1%.
Discounts and premiums are mainly the consequence of supply and demand for the shares on the stock market.
