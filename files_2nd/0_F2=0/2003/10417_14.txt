1 EBITDA is our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items, excluding our share of operating profits and losses of our associates and joint ventures.
EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under UK or US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, because EBITDA is not uniformly dened.
EBITDA should not be considered by investors as an alternative to Group operating loss or loss on ordinary activities before taxation as an indication of operating performance, or as an alternative to cash ow from operating activities as an indication of cash ows.
EBITDA is one of the key financial measures used by the Group for evaluating financial performance, and is discussed in the Operating and financial review and prospects, on page 27.
