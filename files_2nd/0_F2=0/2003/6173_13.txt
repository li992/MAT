Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP Trust and QUEST which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being the Directors share options first exercisable on 21st April 2004 where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the LTIP.
Underlying earnings per share excludes exceptional items and the tax thereon from the profit for the year attributable to shareholders, with the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year as per the calculation for basic earnings per share.

Tangible fixed assets continued Valuation of property assets Investment properties have been valued by the Directors at 31st December 2003 on an open market basis.
The next independent valuation is due in the year ended 31st December 2005.
Tenanted land and buildings were valued as at 31st December 2003 by Messrs Bidwells, Property Consultants as external valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
In reaching the final figure Bidwells departed from the Standards to the extent that they were instructed to inspect and revalue only those properties where the carrying value was in excess of 0.15m and properties where new agreements have been entered into since 31st December 2000.
Bidwells have assumed that each port will continue to be operational and have made the special assumption that all the properties are free from any contamination and that any spillages or contamination will be removed by the tenant prior to the termination of the lease.
The properties are valued on the basis of Market Value with the exception of one building at Rosyth, which is valued at a Depreciated Replacement Cost due to its specialist nature.
In accordance with the Valuation Standards, Messrs Bidwells confirm that they have carried out the valuation of the assets since 1991 and have not provided other property advice.
In relation to that firms preceding year the total fees paid by the Forth Ports PLC group as a percentage of the firms total fee income was less than 5%.
It is not anticipated there will be a material increase.
The valuer, John Sommerville BSc.
Hons, MRICS, has signed the valuation for the first time.
The valuations have been incorporated into the accounts with the resulting revaluation adjustments being taken to the Revaluation Reserve.
These revaluations during the year have resulted in a revaluation surplus of 12.6m Note 28.
No deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets, unless, by the Balance Sheet date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is unlikely that any gain will be rolled over.
If tenanted land and buildings and investment properties had not been revalued, they would have been included at the following amounts at 31st December 2003: Group Group Company Company 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Cost 15.2 13.8 11.9 11.8 Aggregate depreciation based on cost 10.7 10.3 10.2 10.2 Net book value based on cost 4.5 3.5 1.7 1.6 Capital commitments Capital commitments, including the value of work still to be carried out on contracts placed but not provided for, were 5.3m for the Group and 3.0m for the Company 2002 Group 3.1m and Company 0.5m.

In the accounts for 2002, the Groups figures for investments in joint ventures included the Groups share of net liabilities of certain joint venture companies.
The Group has restated these figures as a prior year adjustment to show the Groups share of net liabilities of such companies in provisions for liabilities and charges.

Financial instruments Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.
Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Liabilities The Groups policy on interest rates is to keep floating rate borrowings under review and to use financial instruments to lock into specific rates as and when appropriate.
There is no specific level of Group borrowings that must be fixed.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31st December 2003 was as follows: Floating Rate Fixed Rate Financial Financial Total Currency Liabilities Liabilities Borrowings UK Sterling m m m At 31st December 2003 111.2 0.5 111.7 At 31st December 2002 115.3 0.5 115.8 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above table either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.
The fixed rate 3.75% financial liabilities are redeemable at the discretion of the Board of Forth Ports PLC.
Accordingly, no weighted average period to maturity is shown see Note 18.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on LIBOR which are fixed in advance for periods of up to six months.
NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 59 19.
Financial instruments continued Financial Assets The Group aims to maintain a level of liquidity appropriate to its short-term needs and longer-term strategy.
Enough working capital should be available to allow the Group to operate efficiently without there being surplus funds drawn from the lenders.
At no time should the Group exceed its overdraft and borrowing limits.
Other than short-term debtors the Group has financial assets as follows: 2003 2002 m m Assets held as part of financing arrangements for the Group Sterling cash deposits 5.3 7.0 Debt instruments Loan to joint venture company in sterling denominated securities - 19.0 Zero coupon loan stock held in joint venture company in sterling denominated securities 25.5 - 30.8 26.0 The sterling cash deposits comprise deposits placed on money markets at call and monthly rates.
The zero coupon loan stock has a repayment date of 2013.
Currency Exposures The Groups objectives in managing currency exposures are to use options or other instruments to hedge against future movements where there is material risk from currency exposure.
The Group conducts a relatively small amount of business in currencies other than sterling, and exposure to foreign currency risks is limited.
At 31st December 2003, the Group had one forward foreign exchange option contract in place to hedge the purchase of fixed assets in 2004.
The contract covers the purchase of 1.806m at a rate of 1.3991 : 1.
The unrecognised loss on the contract at 31st December 2003 was 10,000.
The Groups currency exposures, that is, those transactional or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Profit and Loss Account total less than 10,000 in 2003 and 2002.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
The Group had no liabilities not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved.
Maturity of Financial Liabilities The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors and accruals at 31st December 2003, was as follows: Finance 2003 2002 Debt Leases Total Total m m m m Within one year, or on demand 15.0 0.1 15.1 25.1 Between one and two years 35.0 0.1 35.1 0.2 Between two and five years 36.0 0.0 36.0 60.0 Over five years 25.5 - 25.5 30.5 111.5 0.2 111.7 115.8 Borrowing Facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31st December 2003: Floating Floating Rate Rate 2003 2002 m m Expiring within one year - 5.0 Expiring within one and two years 5.0 - Expiring in more than two years 29.0 5.0 34.0 10.0 Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities The fair values of short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and cash at bank and on deposit approximate to book value because of the short maturity of the deposits or because the interest rate on borrowings is reset after periods not greater than six months.

The total amount of unprovided tax is 1.2m.
At present it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
ii Other provisions These comprise provision for employers national insurance charge on the share option plans and claims under the General, Marine and Employers Liability policies.
Settlement of such claims is dependent on negotiation and, potentially, litigation with third parties, the timing of which cannot be predicted accurately.
Deferred income Deferred income arises in respect of grants receivable from HM Government in respect of ports modernisation and freight facility grants, from the European Regional Development Fund and in respect of capital works carried out within the ports.

24. ii Prior year adjustment The prior year adjustment reflects the early adoption of UITF Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts which relate to the measurement of the ESOP and Directors share option scheme charges and the presentation and disclosure of own shares held.
The adoption of these new UITF Abstracts represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The Company and Group have restated opening reserves to comply with the above UITF Abstracts so that reserves have decreased by 0.9m and other fixed asset investments have decreased by the same amount as at 1st January 2002 and to 0.0m at 31st December 2003.
The effect on the prior year profit and loss account of UITF Abstract 38 is to increase profit by 1.7m less tax thereon of 0.4m for amounts relating to the exceptional write down of own shares held previously charged to the profit and loss account.
There is no impact on the 2003 profit and loss account from the adoption of UITF Abstract 38.

Pension schemes The Group operates two pension schemes that cover the vast majority of employees.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
The schemes that the Group has established are as follows: Forth Ports PLC Pension Scheme Port of Tilbury London Limited Pension Fund These schemes are of the defined benefit type, providing benefits that are linked to pay near retirement.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds that are administered by trustees.
These funds are held separately from the Company assets.
The pension cost relating to these schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The latest actuarial assessments of the schemes were as at 5th April 2002.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The assumptions used for the valuations were linked to market conditions.
It was assumed that the investment return will exceed price inflation by 3.5% per annum and that salary increases will exceed price inflation by 1.5% per annum.
The projected unit method was used to determine the pension cost.
Taking the schemes together, the assets represented 94% of the total liabilities: the market value of the assets was 101m.
The funding level of the Forth Ports Scheme exceeded 100%.
The funding level of the Tilbury Fund was 71%.
The total pension cost for these schemes was 4.1m 2002 3.9m.
This compares with Group contributions of 8.8m 2002 8.9m : member contributions are paid in addition.
Additional contributions are being paid to the Tilbury Fund in order to improve the funding level of that Fund.
Subject to actuarial advice these contributions will be paid partly in one further lump sum over the next year, with the balance met by increases in the monthly payments for the next several years.
The need for these additional contributions is partly due to the imposition of a Minimum Funding Requirement MFR for UK pension schemes.
The MFR position for the Forth Ports Scheme is satisfactory and no special contributions are required.
In addition to the schemes that have been set up specifically for Group employees, a number of employees are members of the Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme: this is a national scheme providing defined benefits based on pay near retirement.
However, the contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.2m 2002 0.3m.
The pension cost figures used in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard SSAP24.
The new pension cost accounting standard, FRS17, must be used for the figures that will be shown in the accounts at 31st December 2005 and subsequent years.
Under transitional arrangements the Group is required to disclose the following information about the schemes and the figures that would have been shown under FRS17 in the current balance sheet.
