The increase in the depreciation charge as a result of the revaluation is not significant.
Tangible fixed assets are otherwise stated at cost less depreciation.

Contingent Liabilities The company has provided a guarantee in respect of rented premises occupied by its subsidiary, SRH Radio Sales Limited, which relocated to new rented premises in 1999.
The annual rent is 68,000 and the unexpired term of the lease is six years.
A part of the old premises has been sub-let, reducing the annual cost.
The directors have assessed the likelihood of sub-letting the remainder of the premises and the subsidiary has made provision for the amount of rental payments which are not expected to be covered by future rental income.
There are three guarantees in place between Score Digital and a provider of digital services for three of the digital multiplexes operated.
Under the terms of the relevant agreements the company has a maximum liability of 1m during the first six years of the relevant contracts in respect of Score Digitals financial obligations to the relevant service provider.
Pension Costs a Defined contribution schemes The company and certain subsidiaries operated defined contribution pension schemes during the year, the assets of which were held separately from those of the relevant companies, in independently administered funds.
The pension charge for the year in respect of such money purchase schemes was 0.7m 2002 0.5m.
b Defined benefit schemes The SRH scheme The company operated a pension scheme comprising a defined contribution section and a defined benefits section.
In each case, the assets are held separately from those of the company with the assets being invested in a managed fund.
The pension charge for the year in respect of the defined contribution section is based on a fixed percentage of salary and is included in the figure disclosed in a above, and therefore under the projected unit method of valuing liabilities, the current service cost would be expected to increase as members approach retirement.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members on 1 December 1999.
The Downtown scheme A subsidiary undertaking operated a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay, with the assets also being held separately of the company and invested in a With Profits fund.
This scheme was closed to new members on 1 November 2002.
The pension charge for the year from the defined benefit schemes was as follows: 2003 2002 m m The SRH scheme 0.3 0.4 The Downtown scheme 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.5 51 notes forming part of the financial statements 27.
Pension Costs continued SSAP 24 information Formal valuations of the SRH scheme and the Downtown scheme are carried out triennially by qualified independent actuaries, the latest valuation report for the SRH scheme being at 1 October 2001 and at 1 November 2000 for the Downtown scheme, in each case using the projected unit funding method.
At these dates the market value of the scheme assets was 6.7m for the SRH scheme and 4.1m for the Downtown scheme and the value of these assets represented 85% and 102%, respectively, of the value of benefits accrued to members allowing for future increases in earnings.
For both schemes, the pension charge for the year has been based on these valuations in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs and, in each case, the charge for the year is the same as the contributions paid to the scheme.
The contribution rate payable by the group was 13.5% relating to the SRH scheme inclusive of 2.5% relating to the amortisation of the deficit identified by the actuarial valuation at 1 October 2001 and 8.5% relating to the Downtown scheme.
The principal assumptions in the SRH schemes 2001 valuation were that, over the long term, the annual rate of return on investments would be 8%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher than the annual increase in pensionable remuneration and 3 percentage points higher than the rate of post retirement pension increases.
The principal assumptions in the Downtown schemes 2000 valuation were that, over the longer term, the annual rate of return on investments would be 8.5%, which is 1.5 percentage points higher than the annual increase in pensionable remuneration and 4.5 percentage points higher than the rate of post retirement pension increases.
