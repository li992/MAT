CAPITAL GAINS TAX INFORMATION The market value of the Companys ordinary shares as at 31 March 1982 was 57.5p.
For those shareholders who have purchased shares through the Temple Bar Investment Trust Savings Scheme on a monthly basis, the Inland Revenue has rules for calculating the capital gains tax liability if any on the sale of such shares.
In addition to the normal statutory basis for calculating the capital gains tax liability an optional basis allows taxpayers to aggregate the cost of the shares purchased each month through the Savings Scheme during the Companys accounting year and treat them as if they were a single investment made in the seventh month of that year, which in the Companys case would be July.
In this respect investors are advised to keep a separate note of purchases made through the Savings Scheme since other purchases will not be eligible for the optional basis.
Guidance notes prepared by the Association of Investment Trust Companies should be read before you make a decision as to whether to opt for the optional basis.
These are available free of charge from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office.
