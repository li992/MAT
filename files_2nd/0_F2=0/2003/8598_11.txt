The 1973 valuation, covering substantially the whole of the Groups properties at that time, was made on the basis of open market values by Healey & Baker and G. L. Hearn and Partners.
The 1992 valuation, covering a number of non-retail properties, was made on the basis of open market values by J. Trevor & Sons.
The Directors believe that the aggregate open market value of Group properties exceeds the net book value of 6 billion by a considerable margin.

All participants remaining in the Companys employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to receive a grant of options after a period of three years to purchase the shares awarded to them for the sum of 1, at any time during the 10 years following the date of grant.
The participants entitlement to receive the grant depends on the Companys total shareholder return TSR, compared with a peer group of companies, over the three year performance period.
If the appropriate level of TSR is not achieved, the entitlement to receive the grant of options will lapse.
A charge is taken to the profit and loss account when it becomes clear that a grant will be made.
24,336,858 shares 2002: 24,337,583 are held by an ESOT for the Colleague Share Option Plan note 27 and Executive Share Option Plan note 27.
There is no charge to the profit and loss account because the options are granted at market value.
The market value of the shares held by the ESOTs at 29 March 2003 was 56.2 million 2002: 100.4 million.
The ESOTs waive the rights to the dividends receivable in respect of the shareholder under the above schemes.

Debtors receivable and creditors payable in less than one year, and the current assets and current liabilities of Sainsburys Bank are excluded from the analysis.
The Groups policies and procedures in relation to treasury management, including the management of interest and currency risk, are set out in the operating and financial review on pages 2 to 8.

The above analysis includes store finance leases held in the Groups US operations with a capitalised value of 172 million 2002: 184 million.
It is not considered practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial liabilities as no appropriate external benchmark is available.
They are therefore included in the above analysis at book value.
Financial assets After taking into account various interest rate and currency swaps the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Floating Fixed assets on rate rate which no financial financial interest Total assets assets is paid m m m m Sterling 1,360 1,353 7 US Dollar 123 120 3 Other 99 At 29 March 2003 1,492 1,482 7 3 Sterling 1,140 1,014 115 11 US Dollar 108 105 3 At 30 March 2002 1,248 1,119 115 14 Floating rate financial assets comprise bank balances linked to bank base rates and money market fund balances, money market deposits, commercial paper investments and currency swaps bearing interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The fixed rate financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of 7.75 per cent 2002: 9.86 per cent fixed for an average period of 2.2 years 2002: 10.5 years.
The financial assets on which no interest is paid have a weighted average period until maturity of 5 years.

The financial liabilities on which no interest is paid do not have predetermined dates of payment and therefore a weighted average period of maturity cannot be calculated.
Onerous leases are considered to be a floating rate financial liability as, in establishing the provision, the cash flows have been discounted.
The discount rate is re-appraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The above analysis excludes a cancellable swap in a notional principal amount of 150 million under which the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.09 per cent and receives floating rate LIBOR.
The counterparty may exercise an option to cancel the swap on quarterly dates through to August 2030.
Currency exposures After taking into account forward contracts the Group had net euro denominated monetary assets of 42 million 2002: 40 million, US dollar denominated monetary assets of 29 million 2002: 4 million and Australian dollar monetary assets of 1 million 2002: 1 million.
Excluded from these figures are non-sterling borrowings undertaken by the Company to hedge investments in overseas operations.

Sainsburys Banks exposure to movements in interest rates is shown in the following table which discloses the interest rate re-pricing profile of assets and liabilities as at 29 March 2003.
Any asset or positive gap position reflects the fact that the Banks financial assets re-price more quickly, or in greater proportion than liabilities in a given time period and will tend to benefit net interest rate income in a rising interest rate environment.
A liability or negative gap exists when liabilities re-price 38 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 more quickly or in greater proportion than assets during a given period and tends to benefit net interest income in a declining rate environment.
Items are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate re-pricing date and the maturity date.

The purpose of the QUEST is to acquire shares for UK employees, including Directors, in satisfaction of their options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
Of the 591,396 ordinary shares allotted in relation to the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, 146,444 ordinary shares were subscribed for by the QUEST at a market value of 0.6 million.
These shares were allocated to employees, including Directors, in satisfaction of options exercised under the Scheme.
The Company provided 0.2 million to the QUEST for this purpose.
The cost of this contribution has been transferred by the Company directly to the profit and loss account.
A total of 83,000 2002: 92,900 UK employees participated in the Plan and hold options over 27.8 million shares 2002: 31.3 million.
There have been a total of 2 options exercised in respect of 725 ordinary shares during the year by executors of deceased participants.
Options will normally be exercisable between three and ten years from the date of the grant of option.
It is intended that there will be no further options granted under this plan.

Under the arrangement, the Company has provided a residual value guarantee that the properties will realise at least 170 million at the end of the lease period.
In view of the relatively low amount of this guarantee when compared to the present market value of the freehold interests, the likelihood of this guarantee being invoked is regarded by the Directors as remote, therefore, no contingency is recognised in the accounts.
Operating lease commitments include payments in respect of 10 supermarket properties which were sold in July 2000 for 226 million and leased back by Sainsburys Supermarkets for a period of 23 years at a market rental, which increases by 1 per cent per annum over the lease period.
A residual value guarantee of 39 million has been given by the Company in respect of this transaction.
In view of the relatively low amount of this guarantee when compared to the present market value of the relevant freehold interests, the Directors believe that the likelihood of this guarantee being invoked is remote, therefore, no contingency is recognised in the accounts.
Sainsburys Supermarkets has an executory contract with Swan Infrastructure plc Swan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays UK Infrastructure Fund for the provision of IT services, which expires on 12 November 2007.
In the very unlikely event of a credit rating downgrade of the Company below investment grade, Sainsburys Supermarkets would be liable to lodge, with Swan, an advance against future service charges equivalent to Swans prevailing net borrowings, which are capped at a maximum of 540 million.
The likelihood of this event materialising is regarded by the Directors as remote, therefore no contingency is recognised in the accounts.
There are a number of contingent liabilities relating to disposals and other contractual liabilities under which it is not considered any liability will arise.

These schemes were closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Group Personal Pension Plan was closed on 31 January 2002.
Two new Stakeholder Pension Schemes were launched in April 2002.
The pension cost for the year ended 29 March 2003 is based on the results of a triennial valuation carried out by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries, as at 1 April 2000, on the projected unit basis.
The assumptions underlying this valuation were subsequently updated in April 2001 to take account of the change in economic circumstances.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the revised actuarial valuations are: % Long-term rate of return on investments before retirement 6.75 after retirement 5.00 Average annual increase in total pensionable salary excluding promotional increments 3.75 Average annual increase in present and future payments 2.25 Average rate of inflation 2.25 As at 1 April 2001, the market value of the assets of the UK schemes were 2,687 million 2000: 2,943 million.
The market value was sufficient to cover 106 per cent 2000: 113 per cent of the total liabilities of the schemes, a surplus of 145 million 2000: 346 million.
Total pension contribution costs for the Group were 73 million for the year ended 29 March 2003 2002: 71 million of which the pension contribution costs of the UK defined benefit schemes and UK defined contribution schemes amounted to 55 million and 9 million respectively 2002: 59 million and 4 million respectively.
There is a variation from the regular cost because of scheme surpluses.
These surpluses are being amortised over a period using a method which reduces the amount of variation from the regular cost until 2010 for the JSPDBS and 2006 for the JSEPS.
Total costs for 2003 are after taking account of an amortisation of scheme surpluses of 17 million 2002: 19 million.
The Groups UK pension cost is not expected to change until the results of the recent triennial valuation are known.
The Group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US.
The pension costs relating to the US benefit schemes have been determined with the advice of independent actuaries.
The charge to the profit and loss account of 9 million 2002: 8 million has been calculated in accordance with US accounting principles but would not have been materially different had UK accounting principles been applied.
