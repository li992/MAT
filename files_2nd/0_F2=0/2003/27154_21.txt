Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2003 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued in January 2003.
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year.
Murray Income Trust PLC 37 Notes to the Financial Statements e Investments Listed investments are valued in the Financial Statements at middle-market prices and unlisted investments at a valuation determined by the Directors.
In determining the valuation of unlisted investments the Directors adopt the middle-market price where a dealing facility exists and apply a discount if considered appropriate.
Where no dealing facility exists the factors to which the Directors have regard include, inter alia, the earnings record and growth prospects of the security, the ratings of comparable listed companies, the yield on the security, where appropriate, and any recent transactions.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
For unmatched forward exchange contracts entered into to hedge against fluctuating exchange rates on foreign currency assets or liabilities the difference between the value at the contracted rate and at the forward rate ruling at the year end is taken credit for as a debtor or provided for as a creditor.
Translation of all other foreign currency balances including matched forward contracts, foreign assets and foreign liabilities is at the middle rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as a capital gain or loss in the capital reserve or revenue account depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.

However, in certain circumstances such as: i investments where independent formal valuations are carried out and advised to the Company: ii investments where arms length transactions established a new price: iii investments where there has been a public event such as, for example, obtaining a listing on a recognised stock exchange or formal appointment of either receiver or liquidator: a revaluation will be carried out at the relevant month end.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations, for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options.
The Company undertook no derivative transactions during the current or the previous year.
The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market price risk, being the risk that the value of the investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest or currency movement, ii interest rate risk and iii liquidity risk.
In line with the Companys investment objective, the portfolio comprises UK securities and therefore has no direct exposure to foreign currency risk.
To mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting, market and sector analysis.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Current strategy is detailed in the Chairmans Statement on page 7, and in the Investment Managers Review on page 13.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numbers in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out on page 1.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowings powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 12 to 14.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Boards policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is on page 9 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is on pages 10 and 11.
Interest rate risk Financial assets The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Non-Interest Floating Rate Bearing 2003 2002 2003 2002 000 000 000 000 Sterling 4,651 3,393 340,789 415,757 US Dollar 11 4,652 3,394 340,789 415,757 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
44 Murray Income Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements Financial liabilities The Company has borrowings by way of loan facilities, details of which are in note 11.
The fair value of these loans has been calculated at 35 million as at 30 June 2003 2002 31 million.
There is no difference between the value stated in the Financial Statements for the loans and their fair value due to current loan rates being similar to those applied.
As at 30 June 2003 the Company also had an additional committed facility of 25 million.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
Taxation There is no taxation charge for the year.
Approved investment trusts are exempt from tax on gains made within the fund.
The tax assessed for the period is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2002 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2003 2002 000 000 Revenue on ordinary activities before taxation 13,121 12,639 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by the applicable rate of corporation tax of 30% 2002 30% 3,936 3,792 Effects of: Non taxable UK dividends 4,756 4,562 Unutilised loan relationships 205 104 Unutilised management expenses 492 657 Disallowable expenses 123 9 No provision for deferred tax has been made in the current or prior accounting period.
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 8,022,000 2002 6,826,000 arising as a result of having unutilised management expenses.
These expenses will only be utilised if the tax treatment of capital gains made by approved investments trusts, or the Companys investment profile, changes.
