A29424 S&N accounts 16 7 03 12:48 pm Page 45 44 Scottish & Newcastle Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain properties are included at valuation.
Prior to the introduction of FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets professional valuations were undertaken on a regular basis and any net surpluses were taken to the revaluation reserve.
Following the introduction of FRS 15 surpluses from prior valuations will continue to be reflected in the accounts but no further valuations will be undertaken.
b Basis of consolidation i The Group accounts consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for the period of 52 weeks 53 weeks when necessary ending on the Sunday nearest 30 April.
ii On the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings or businesses or joint ventures, fair values are attributed to the underlying net assets acquired.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the fair values.
Prior to 4 May 1998 goodwill was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
The profit or loss on the disposal of a business acquired before 4 May 1998 takes account of any purchased goodwill previously written off through reserves.
Goodwill acquired after 3 May 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included from the date of acquisition.
iii Entities which the Group holds long term and which are jointly controlled by the Group and other parties are treated as joint ventures.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of the results and reserves of joint ventures.
iv No profit and loss account is presented for Scottish & Newcastle plc as provided by S. 230 of the Companies Act 1985. c Brands Acquired brands, which are separately indentifiable, are recorded at fair value on acquisition where this can be measured reliably.
Where the useful life of the brand is considered to be indefinite no annual amortisation is provided but the brand is subject to annual impairment review and any impairment to carrying value is charged against profits in the year.
d Depreciation Depreciable fixed assets are written off on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: i Freehold land is not depreciated.
ii Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the following periods: Industrial buildings 30 to 50 years Licensed buildings 50 years iii Buildings held on lease are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of 50 years or the unexpired term of the lease.
iv Other tangible assets are written off over their estimated useful lives as follows: Fittings: Licensed and related properties 5 to 15 years Vehicles, plant and equipment: Brewing plant 15 to 30 years Kegging, bottling and canning plant 5 to 20 years Commercial vehicles and private cars 3 to 8 years Containers and other equipment 3 to 15 years e Stock valuation Stocks are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The cost of raw materials and consumables is actual cost.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises materials, excise duty where appropriate, labour and attributable production overheads.
f Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided, without discounting, on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except for those which should not be recognised under FRS 19, calculated at the enacted rates at which it is estimated that tax will be payable.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
g Foreign currencies Revenues and costs of overseas companies are included in the consolidated profit and loss account at average rates of exchange during the year with the year end adjustment to closing rates being taken to reserves.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at year end rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of investments in, and opening net assets of, foreign subsidiary undertakings are dealt with through reserves net of differences on related foreign currency borrowings and swaps.
Other gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
h Retirement benefits The expected cost of pensions in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the expected remaining service lives of employees in the scheme.
i Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Assets held under finance leases, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are included in the balance sheet as fixed assets at cost less depreciation.
The capital element of future rentals is treated as a liability.
The interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
j Turnover Turnover is sales, including recovery of duty where appropriate, rents receivable and other trading income of the Group, after eliminating intra-Group transactions and excluding VAT and property disposals.
A29424 S&N accounts 16 7 03 12:48 pm Page 46 45 Scottish & Newcastle Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued k Financial instruments i Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds adjusted to amortise the finance cost of debt evenly over the term of the debt.
ii Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate exposures and are accounted for under the hedge accounting method.
Amounts payable or receivable under such agreements are recognised as adjustments to interest payable over the period of the agreements.
When interest rate swaps and underlying debt are terminated together, the net gain or loss is taken to the profit and loss account as interest payable.
When interest rate swaps are terminated but the underlying debt is retained then the gain loss is deferred and is amortised to interest payable over the remaining life of the underlying debt.
iii Forward foreign currency contracts are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates and are accounted for under the hedge accounting method.
Gains or losses arising under these contracts are taken to the profit and loss account in line with the transactions which they are hedging.
If the underlying commitment does not occur and the instrument ceases to be a hedge, a gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.

The total pension costs for the Group, which are assessed in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, were 113m 2002 118m.
The main Group schemes are defined benefit schemes and pension costs relating to these schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuations used a market related approach and were made at 31 October 2000.
The valuations assumed a real long term interest rate yield of 40% per annum and real earnings growth of 20% per annum.
At 31 October 2000 the market value of the assets of the main Group schemes was 1,753m and the assets were sufficient to cover 116% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
Surpluses are spread over the remaining service lives 12 years of employees in the schemes.

11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held in the employee share trusts which have been treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts for share options granted to employees and warrants where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill have also been calculated since, in the opinion of the directors, this is a more representative indicator of the trading performance of the Group.
Earnings per share are calculated as follows: 2003 2002 Weighted Weighted average average number Earnings number Earnings Earnings of shares per share Earnings of shares per share m million pence m million pence Basic 1401 8283 169 1965 6455 304 Dilution impact: options 21 25 01 warrants Diluted 1401 8304169 1965 6480 303 Exclude exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill 2056 247 867 134 Diluted excluding exceptionals and amortisation of goodwill 3457 8304 416 2832 6480 437 A29424 S&N accounts 16 7 03 12:48 pm Page 51 50 Scottish & Newcastle Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts 12 Intangible assets Goodwill Brands Total m m m Cost At 28 April 2002 4621 4621 Businesses acquired 1,1777 4000 1,5777 Exchange adjustments 1557 395 1952 At 27 April 2003 1,7955 4395 2,2350 Amortisation At 28 April 2002 435 435 Provided during the year 750 750 Exchange adjustments 83 83 At 27 April 2003 1268 1268 Net book value at 28 April 2002 4186 4186 Net book value at 27 April 2003 1,6687 4395 2,1082 Goodwill is amortised over 20 years.

The remaining 1,4028m is repayable by lump sum between 2003 and 2016.
Interest rates, after taking account of interest rate swaps, ranged between 08% and 75%.
Sterling bank borrowings are 5364m and are repayable by lump sum in 2007.
Interest rates, after taking account of interest rate swaps, ranged between 33% and 65%.
Other loans The 79% redeemable debenture stock 2008 was fair valued at acquisition on 1 November 1993.
The nominal value is 215m and the nominal rate of interest is 12125%.
Loan capital Borrowings of 527m are secured on fixed and other assets.

The reference rate for floating rate liabilities is determined by the benchmark rate for the relevant country e. g. Libor or by the eligible bill discount rate for certain sterling borrowings.
The figures shown in the tables above take account of interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate profile of financial liabilities.
The Group has entered into 225m and 420m of interest rate swaps where the Group is paying a fixed rate of interest maturing between 2005 and 2014.
Under these swaps the bank has the option to terminate or vary the rate of interest on the swap.
The weighted average maturity as disclosed above assumes that these swaps run to final maturity.
The earliest dates at which the bank can exercise their option ranges from May 2003 to August 2005.
The Group has entered into 155m of capped interest rate swaps where the rate payable is fixed provided interest rates remain below 5%.
If interest rates rise above this level, rates are subject to an interest rate cap.
Financial assets The Group held the following financial assets: 2003 2002 m m Interest bearing: Sterling cash 309 750 Euro cash 299 67 Sterling deposits 1397 Euro deposits 09 01 Sterling trade loans 1658 1474 Euro trade loans 774 718 3049 4407 Cash and deposits are placed on short term maturities up to a maximum of three months at relevant market rates for the maturity concerned.
In common with other major brewers the Group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the Groups beer.
The interest rate, terms of loan and supply terms for beer purchases are all inter related and vary among customers.
The benefit of trade loans should, therefore, not be viewed solely in terms of interest rates.
The interest rate profile of trade loans was as follows: 2003 2002 m m Fixed 1492 1476 Floating 940 716 2432 2192 The fixed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 48% 2002 50% and a weighted average period of 52 years 2002 46 years.
The reference rate for floating rate trade loans is mainly United Kingdom base rates.

v Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities was as follows: 2003 2002 m m Within one year 3737 4658 Between one and two years 1,3559 2197 Between two and five years 1,2709 6610 After five years 6856 611 3,6861 1,4076 vi Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowings available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities were as follows: 2003 2002 m m Expiring within one year 174 Expiring between one and two years 328 5070 Expiring after two years 8436 1,2468 8764 1,7712 vii Fair values Set out below is a comparison, by category, of book values and fair values for financial assets and liabilities: 2003 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments: Short term borrowings and current portion of long term borrowings 3651 3594 4658 4656 Long term borrowings 3,2439 3,1669 9418 9372 Finance leases 771 771 Cash and deposits 617 617 2215 2215 Trade loans 2432 2432 2192 2192 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps 1960 409 Derivative financial instruments held to hedge the currency exposure on expected future sales purchases: Forward foreign currency contracts 41 14 Market values have been used where possible to determine the fair value of swaps, forward foreign currency contracts and debt instruments.
As described in iii above trade loans are linked to customer terms of trade for the supply of beer.
The fair value of trade loans cannot be viewed solely in terms of interest rates and the fair value is considered to be in line with the book value.
The fair values of other items have been calculated by discounting expected future cashflows at prevailing interest rates.
viii Hedges As explained in the Operating and Financial Review, it is the Groups policy to hedge interest rate risk and transactional currency exposures.
Gains and losses on hedging instruments are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: 2003 2002 Gains Losses Net Gains Losses Net m m m m m m Gains and losses on hedges at 29 April 2002 143 566 423 183 374 191 Arising in previous years included in 2002 03 income 70 324 254 05 159 154 Gains and losses not included in 2002 03 income: Arising before 29 April 2002 73 242 169 178 215 37 Arising after 28 April 2002 26 1724 1750 35 351 386 Gains and losses on hedges at 27 April 2003 47 1966 1919 143 566 423 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2003 41 532 491 91 267 176 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 or later 06 1434 1428 52 299 247 A29424 S&N accounts 16 7 03 12:48 pm Page 57 56 Scottish & Newcastle Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts 22 Provisions for liabilities and charges Onerous Deferred contracts Reorganisation tax Total m m m m Group At 28 April 2002 140 524 768 1432 Transfer from debtors 160 160 Acquisitions 84 84 Profit and loss account 43 717 609 1369 Utilised during year 59 849 908 Exchange adjustments 05 3237 Transfer to debtors 45 45 At 27 April 2003 124 397 1378 1899 Company At 28 April 2002 16 04 20 Transfer from debtors Profit and loss account 202 202 Utilised during year 04 04 At 27 April 2003 12 206 218 The reorganisation costs relate to the Beer Division reorganisation costs charged as exceptional items in 2002 and 2003.

Such tax would only be payable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief or to utilise unrecognised capital losses.

b The Group acquired the remaining interests in Danones beer business on 28 June 2002 when the transaction became unconditional.
The payment to Danone was made on 23 September 2002.

In certain circumstances the Group can be required to purchase Danones Spanish beer business for 442m.
The results of Hartwall in the period prior to acquisition were: Hartwall 1 January 2002 12 months to to 17 May 31 December 2002 2001 m m Turnover 2118 4955 Operating profit 325 997 Profit before taxation 290 926 Taxation 100 156 Extraordinary items 42 Minority interests 76 200 Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 72 570 Apart from profit attributable to ordinary shareholders there were no recognised gains and losses for Hartwall in the period from 1 January 2002 to the date of acquisition.
The company holding the Danone beer business was restructured prior to acquisition and only certain of the assets and liabilities were inherited by Scottish &Newcastle plc.
In these circumstances it is not practical to provide comparable details of profits or recognised gains and losses for the business for financial periods before acquisition.
The results above are based on the accounting policies used by Hartwall pre acquisition.
The results and cash flows of the acquisitions in the period after acquisition were: Danones Hartwall beer business m m Turnover 7731 Operating profit net of goodwill amortisation 506 140 Net cash flow from operating activities 248 270 Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and financial investment 540 The fair value of other acquisitions during the year was 14m and the consideration was 277m giving goodwill of 263m.
