57 Egg plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies a Accounting convention The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with the special provisions of Part VII Chapter 2 of the Companies Act 1985 relating to banking groups.
They are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board and the Statements of Recommended Accounting Practice issued by the British Bankers Association.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared under Schedule 9 of the Companies Act 1985.
The balance sheet of the Company is prepared under Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Group has consistently applied, where appropriate, all new Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board.
b Basis of consolidation The financial statements of the Group incorporate the assets, liabilities, and results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2003.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from presenting its own profit and loss account under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. c Associated undertakings and joint ventures An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting rights, and over which it exercises significant influence.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates and of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
d Bad and doubtful debts Provisions are applied to reduce the carrying value of loans and advances to their realisable amount, in whole or in part, when they are considered wholly or partly irrecoverable.
The specific provision is established to cover all identified bad and doubtful debts and is recognised when there is reasonable doubt over the collectability of principal and interest in accordance with the loan or credit agreement.
Amounts provided for are determined by specific identification on mortgage lending.
In the case of loans, in certain circumstances management also assess the required level of provision on a case-by-case basis when accounts become seriously delinquent.
The level of specific provisions required for the majority of impaired debt, however, can be calculated at a portfolio level from the movement of balances between risk states from month to month, and the extrapolation of these movements to estimate the level of impairment of currently delinquent debt.
The method is standard across the Finance industry for the calculation of provision for bad and doubtful debts on a portfolio basis.
Using this method the key determinants of the bad debt charge are the relative levels of arrears, the rate of change of these arrears and the level of loss from defaults.
The aggregate provisions that are made during the period less amounts released and recoveries of bad debts previously written off are charged against operating profit.
General provisions are raised in respect of losses, which although not specifically identified, are known from experience to be present in any such portfolios.
The level of general provision is determined by the application of a number of basis points to the aspects of the portfolio which are not currently identified as delinquent but which experience suggests contains lending which is currently impaired and will ultimately lead to losses.
The number of basis points applied to the portfolios are regularly assessed against recent experience and adjusted if appropriate.
Interest on loans and advances is accrued to income until such time as reasonable doubt exists about its collectability: thereafter, and until all or part of the loan is written off, interest continues to accrue on customers accounts, but is not included in income.
Such suspended interest is deducted from loans and advances on the balance sheet.
e Goodwill Purchased goodwill is capitalised and amortised to nil, on a straight-line basis, over the investments estimated useful life, assessed on an individual basis.
Impairment reviews are carried out as approprate.
58 Egg plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued f Tangible fixed assets Leasehold improvements, computer equipment, computer software, fixtures, furniture and other tangible assets are stated at cost.
These costs are capitalised and depreciated to their estimated residual values in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Leasehold improvements 10 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Plant and equipment 3 10 years Software costs see below 3 years Land and buildings are stated at cost and are not depreciated.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are brought into commercial use.
g Software Costs incurred in acquiring and developing computer software for internal use that are directly attributable to the functioning of computer hardware are capitalised as tangible fixed assets where the software supports a significant business system and the expenditure leads to the creation of an identifiable durable asset.
Website design and content development costs have been capitalised where they deliver identifiable benefits greater than their capitalised costs, otherwise they are expensed to the profit and loss.
h Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their fair market values and included within fixed assets.
Commitments under these leases are included within other liabilities.
Interest cost is amortised over the life of the underlying asset in proportion to the net cash investment.
Operating lease rentals are expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
i Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date or at the forward exchange rate, as appropriate.
Exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 31 December and their profit and loss accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year to 31 December.
Exchange differences relating to revenue expense items are included within the profit and loss account: those arising from the application of closing rates of exchange to the opening net assets are taken to profit and loss account reserves.
j Debt securities Debt securities intended to be held for continuing use are disclosed as investment securities and are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Where dated investment securities have been purchased at a discount or premium, these discounts and premiums are amortised through the profit and loss account over the period from date of purchase to date of maturity.
The cost of investment securities is adjusted for unamortised discounts and premiums.
The amortisation of discounts and premiums is performed on a straight-line basis and is included in Interest receivable.
Debt securities which do not meet the Groups investment policy criteria are held for resale and are stated at their net realisable value.
k Derivatives and off-balance sheet instruments Transactions are undertaken in derivative financial instruments, which include currency swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward rate agreements, options, credit derivatives and similar instruments, for non-trading purposes.
Derivatives are all classified as non-trading and are entered into for the purpose of matching or eliminating risk from potential movements in interest rates inherent in the Groups assets, liabilities and positions or for the purpose of reducing credit risk inherent in the Groups balance sheet.
All derivative transactions including foreign exchange and credit are for hedging purposes and so therefore it is decided at the outset which position the derivative will be hedging.
Derivatives are reviewed regularly for their effectiveness as hedges and corrective action taken, if appropriate.
Non-trading derivatives are accounted for in a manner consistent with the assets, liabilities, or positions being hedged.
Profits and losses on these instruments are recognised in accordance with the accounting treatment of the underlying transaction as an adjustment to Interest receivable or Interest payable.
Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Where off-balance sheet instruments are terminated prior to the underlying hedged transaction terminating, any profits or losses realised on early termination are deferred and 59 Egg plc Annual Report 2003 matched against the income or expenditure arising from the underlying hedged transaction.
If the underlying instrument is sold, extinguished or terminated, the remaining unamortised gains or losses, fees and commissions on the hedge are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Fees and commissions payable on derivatives are deferred and amortised over the life of the derivative contract.
l Debt securities sold and repurchased As a form of funding, certain investment securities are sold under repurchase agreements.
Those securities sold are retained on the balance sheet and a liability recorded in bank deposits equal to the cash repos consideration of the sale.
The cost of the repo is calculated as being the difference between the sale and repurchase price of the security and is accrued as interest payable over the life of the transaction on a yield basis.
m Securitisation of assets The Group has issued debt securities in order to finance certain portfolios of loan and investment assets.
These obligations are secured on the assets of the Group.
The securitised assets and the related liabilities are presented gross within the relevant headings in the Group balance sheet under the gross presentation method.
n Pensions The Groups main pension scheme, which covers 81% of the Groups employees who have taken up their right to contribute to a pension scheme, is a defined contribution scheme.
For this scheme the cost is charged to the profit and loss account as contributions become due.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separately administered fund.
Certain employees are members of the Prudential Group defined benefit scheme.
In line with paragraph 9b of FRS 17, even though this scheme is a defined benefit scheme the contributions have been disclosed as defined contributions on the grounds that this scheme is part of the Prudential plc Group Scheme, and it is not possible to identify the Egg share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
It should be noted that the Egg share of the underlying assets and liabilities and deficit within the Group Scheme is not material.
Therefore, in accordance with the treatment prescribed by FRS 17, the cost of the defined benefit pension scheme is charged to the profit and loss account as determined by independent qualified actuaries performing formal actuarial valuations to spread the cost of the pension over the service lives of the employees on the basis of contributions payable to the Group Scheme.
Further details of the Prudential plc Group defined benefit scheme are shown in the Group financial statements of Prudential plc.
o Taxation Tax is charged on all taxable profits arising in the accounting period.
Deferred taxation is recognised on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is not recognised where there might be some doubt about the recovery of a deferred tax asset.
p Income recognition Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account as it accrues except where interest is suspended as set out in policy note d above.
Arrangement fees and commissions receivable in respect of payment protection insurance and other insurance products, are recognised on the basis of work done and an appropriate provision is calculated to reflect potential rebates to customers.
q Profit share from creditor insurance policies Written premiums are earned over the life of the policy.
These earnings are matched against claims incurred in each calendar year, recognising any surplus profit above the agreed return on capital for the underwriter.
r Mortgage incentives and commissions Cashbacks and discounts, which are recoverable from the customer in the event of an early redemption, are deferred and amortised to the profit and loss account over the early redemption penalty period of the product.
Commission payable in respect of mortgages sold is capitalised and amortised over the early redemption penalty period.
s Brand development costs Brand development costs are written off as incurred.

Details of the deficit on the Group Scheme can be found in the Prudential plc financial statements.
The defined benefit pension scheme is non-contributory and provides members with a maximum pension of 38 60 of Final Pensionable Earnings at the normal retirement age of 60.
Final Pensionable Earnings are the sum of the pensionable salary for the 12 months immediately preceding retirement or termination of employment and, for entrants since 31 May 1989, are restricted to salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap, which at the time of writing is 99,000.
The scheme also provides on death, whether in service, in deferment or following retirement, pensions for spouse and eligible children.
The spouses pension on death in service is the higher of 54% of the members prospective pension at age 60 or 25% of salary in the 12 months preceding death subject to the earnings cap.
The spouses pension on death in deferment is 50% of the members deferred pension at the date of death.
On death after retirement, the spouses pension is 50% of the members pension in payment ignoring any pension commuted for a lump sum at retirement.
A lump sum death in service benefit of four times Final Pensionable Earnings is also provided.
Pension increases after retirement are wholly discretionary but in recent years annual increases have been awarded broadly in line with inflation.
Discretionary increases are taken into account in calculating transfer values payable in lieu of deferred pension benefits.
Other staff costs include temporary staff costs, training, recruitment, medical health insurance, social welfare costs and other sundry staff costs.

The ability of the Group to transfer losses to Prudential plc and Prudential group companies is based on Prudential plc holding at least 75% of the Groups ordinary shares.
The tax charge assessed for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%.
The differences for the current year are explained below: 2003 2002 m m Loss on ordinary activities before tax 34.4 16.6 Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2002: 30% 10.3 5.0 Effects of: Capital allowances in excess of depreciation for the year 1.6 0.6 Short-term timing differences 4.6 2.5 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.3 0.6 Share of losses on associate undertakings 0.2 0.5 Inter-company gains on transfer of assets 0.9 Goodwill amortisation 0.5 0.7 Overseas tax at less than UK standard rate 5.8 Overseas losses not allowable for tax purposes 3.3 10.8 Gain on dilution of share in Investment Funds Direct Holdings Limited 1.0 Adjustments for prior years 0.3 2.6 Current tax charge 3.4 5.9 9 Loss on ordinary activities after tax for the Company 25.4 million 2002: 92.8 million of the Group loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company has been dealt with in the accounts of the Company.

The noteholders in securitisations from this vehicle have a proportionate interest in each account balance in the trust.
As at 31 December 2003 the value of this interest was 1.5 billion 2002: 500 million.
This securitisation does not qualify for linked presentation under FRS 5, Reporting the Substance of Transactions, and the total portfolio is therefore included within Loans and advances to customers.
The funding giving rise to the noteholders interest is included within Deposits by banks see note 24.

72 Egg plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Employee benefit trust Egg may make awards of shares at no cost to eligible employees selected by the Remuneration Committee under a restricted share plan the plan.
All Eggs directors and employees, including employees of its subsidiaries, will be eligible to participate, subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
It is, however, intended that participation will in practice be restricted to selected individuals in key positions.
Employees who are within two years of their anticipated retirement date are not eligible to participate, except in circumstances which the Remuneration Committee considers to be exceptional.
Egg has made the vesting of awards subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions from January 2003 onwards.
Previously the awards have been conditional on service completed.
Egg has established a discretionary employee benefit trust, the Egg Employee Trust, by a trust deed dated 26 April 2000 between Egg and Mourant & Co. Trustees Limited.
At 31 December 2003 the trust held 5.8 million ordinary shares 31 December 2002: 5.0 million, with a market value of 7.3 million which are intended to be used principally for delivery of shares under the Companys employee incentive plans and a nominal value of 2.9 million.
The arrangements for the distribution to employees of shares held in trust and for entitlement to dividend depend on the particulars of each award under the plan.
Shares held in trust are conditionally gifted to employees.
The costs of share awards under the plan are charged to the profit and loss account evenly over the period of service to which awards are made.
Since these shares were subscribed for by the Egg Employee Trust on flotation, using the proceeds of a gift from the Company, they are reflected within the consolidated balance sheet of the Group at nil cost.
For details of the numbers of shares purchased and held please refer to note 20.

33 Financial instruments including derivatives The Group uses financial instruments including derivatives for the purpose of supporting the strategic and operational business activities of the Group and reducing and eliminating the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Interest rate risk arises in the Groups core balance sheet as a result of fixed rate, variable rate and non-interest bearing assets and liabilities.
Exposure to interest rate movements arises when there is a mismatch between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities.
Foreign exchange risk arises as a result of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
For the purpose of reducing interest rate risk, the Group uses a number of derivative instruments, comprised of interest rate swaps, interest rate options, caps, futures and forward rate agreements.
For the purpose of reducing foreign exchange risk the Group uses forward foreign currency contracts and currency swaps.
The Asset and Liability Management Committee regularly reviews the Groups policies relating to the use of financial instruments, including derivatives and the controls and procedures in place to manage risk exposure.
All of the Groups financial instrument activity is contracted with authorised financial institutions.
The numerical disclosures shown in this note outline how hedging instruments are used to reduce exposure to interest rate risk arising from net differences between assets and liabilities maturing in different time periods.
Short term debtors and creditors have been included in all of the following disclosures, where applicable.
Further information on the Groups management of risk is contained in the Financial Review on page 26. a Interest rate sensitivity gap analysis Part of the Groups return on financial instruments is obtained from managing the mismatch of the dates on which the instruments mature or, if earlier, the dates on which interest receivable on assets and interest payable on liabilities are next reset to market rates.
The table below summarises these repricing mismatches on the Groups non-trading book as at 31 December 2003.
Items are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate repricing date and maturity date.

Foreign exchange exposures using currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The gains and losses on these instruments arising from change in fair value are not recognised in the profit and loss account immediately they arise.
Instead the gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Where off-balance sheet instruments are terminated prior to the underlying hedged transaction terminating, any profits or losses realised on early termination are deferred and matched against the income or expenditure arising from the underlying hedged transaction.
If the underlying instrument is sold, extinguished or terminated, the remaining unamortised gains or losses on the hedge are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The table below summarises the unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 and movements therein during the year.

The fair value of a derivative contract represents the amount at which that contract could be exchanged in an arms length transaction, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date.
Positive fair values arise where gross positive fair values exceed gross negative fair values on a contract-by-contract basis.
This equates to replacement cost.
The totals of positive and negative fair values arising on non-trading derivatives at the balance sheet date have been netted where the Group has a legal right of offset with the relevant counterparty.
Total positive fair values after netting equates to net replacement cost.
All exchange-traded instruments are subject to cash requirements under the standard margin arrangements applied by the individual exchanges.
Such instruments are not subject to significant credit risk.
Other derivative contracts are not subject to these cash requirements.
