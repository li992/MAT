10666.01 Pages 42-55 14 04 2004 19:44 Page 47 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2003 1.
Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards, adopting the following principal accounting policies.
From 1 January 2003 the Group has changed its accounting policy in respect of goodwill.
Goodwill is now treated as a local currency asset and is therefore retranslated on consolidation at the exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date.
This accounting policy is considered to be more appropriate for the circumstances of the Group.
The effect of this change in accounting policy is to decrease goodwill amortisation by 0.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2003 and increase goodwill amortisation by 1.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2002.
In addition, this change in accounting policy has reduced goodwill by 4.9 million at 31 December 2002.
Comparative period results have been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cash flows and net assets of Aegis Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings.
Where subsidiaries are acquired in the year, their results and cash flows are included from the date of acquisition up to the balance sheet date.
All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated.
The financial statements also include the Groups attributable share of associated undertakings and joint ventures results for the year and of their net assets liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Goodwill Prior to 1 January 1998, it was the Groups policy to write off purchased goodwill immediately to reserves and charge it to the profit and loss account only on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, the Group has elected to continue with this accounting policy.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10, goodwill arising on each acquisition on or after 1 January 1998 is capitalised as an asset in the balance sheet.
The directors review the estimated useful economic life of goodwill arising on each acquisition and, where this is considered finite, the goodwill is amortised over this period on a straight line basis not exceeding 20 years.
Following the first full year of ownership of an acquired business, the goodwill capitalised is reviewed for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill may also be reviewed at any time if there is a new event or change in circumstance which may impact upon its recoverable amount.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions is provided based on the directors best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date.
The liability is discounted and an imputed interest charge is included in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Upon settlement, monetary assets and liabilities are re-translated at the rate ruling on the settlement date.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are re-translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon re-translation at the settlement date or balance sheet date are taken to the profit and loss account.
Short term forward exchange contracts are used to hedge transactions with material foreign currency exposures.
Assets and liabilities denoted under such contracts are translated at the contracted rate.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of foreign currency borrowings used to provide a hedge against foreign currency investments are taken directly to reserves.
For consolidation purposes, profit and loss accounts and cash flows in foreign currencies, arising in foreign subsidiaries, are translated into sterling at average exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon consolidation are taken directly to reserves.

Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments The costs of issue of capital instruments such as the issue costs of new debt are charged to the profit and loss account on an annual basis over the life of the instrument.
The Group has entered into a swap agreement to convert interest payable on its US dollar Loan Notes from fixed into floating rate based upon the US dollar six month LIBOR rate.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Group remits or receives the differential between the fixed and variable rate calculated by reference to the notional principal amount.
This differential is charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year to which it relates.
Turnover Turnover represents the value of media handled by the Group on behalf of clients, together with fees relating to media and research services provided.
Media turnover is recognised when charges are made to clients, principally when advertisements appear in the media.
Fees are recognised over the period of the relevant assignments or agreements.
For the market research business, turnover is recognised either on completion of a project or on the satisfactory completion of a specific phase of a project.
Provision is made for losses on a project when identified.
Invoices raised during the course of a project are booked as deferred income on the balance sheet until such a time as the related revenue is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all fixed assets, except freehold land, to their residual value over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 1%-5% per annum Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10%-20% per annum or over the period of the lease, if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment & vehicles 10%-50% per annum Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are held in the Company balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Associated undertakings and joint ventures Companies in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies it exercises a significant influence are treated as associated undertakings.
Investments in associated undertakings are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less provision for impairment in value plus attributable post-acquisition retained profits or losses and amortisation of goodwill.
Attributable profits or losses are included in the Group profit and loss account in the year.

Principal accounting policies continued Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Amounts are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment, plus attributable post-acquisition profits or losses.
In the case of the Groups joint venture in eVerger, no account is taken of the trading results of eVergers underlying investments.
Other fixed asset investments The Companys shares held by the Aegis Group Employee Share Trust are included as fixed asset investments until such time as the interest in the shares is transferred unconditionally to employees.
Provision is made for any permanent diminution in value of shares held by the Trust.
Costs of administration are included in the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Work in progress Work in progress comprises attributable costs on market research projects and is held in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Where leasehold properties remain unutilised by the Group and have not been sublet, provision is made in full for the outstanding rental payments together with other outgoings for the remaining period of the lease.
This provision takes into account any future sublet income reasonably expected to be obtained.
Future rental payments are charged against this provision in the period in which they are made.
Deferred taxation Full provision is made for timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pension costs Retirement benefits for employees of certain companies in the Group are provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contribution payable in the year.
Segmental reporting The Group operates in two business sectors: media communications and market research.

Deferred consideration and other commitments Deferred consideration, which has been provided for in creditors, may be paid to the vendors of certain subsidiary undertakings in the years to 2005.

Financial instruments The Board of Directors has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments which are discussed in further detail in the Treasury Management section of the Financial Review on page 10.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Group, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Groups policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
Management of financial risk The Group considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Groups policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk A significant portion of the Groups activities takes place overseas.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures on transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and on consolidation upon the translation of profits and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups foreign currency management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge all transactions and financial instruments with material currency exposures.
This is achieved using short-term forward exchange contracts.
At the year end, the aggregate value of transactions and related hedges was not material.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from the translation of profits or net assets as these represent an accounting rather than cash exposure.
The Groups policy is to borrow locally wherever possible to act as a natural hedge against the translation risk arising from its net investments overseas.
A currency analysis of borrowings is given below.
Liquidity The Groups objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Group also seeks to manage its working capital requirement by requiring clients to pay for media in advance whenever possible.
At 31 December 2003, the Group had net debt before finance lease obligations and issue costs of new debt of 152.6 million 2002: 122.3 million.
The Group had cash balances of 147.4 million at 31 December 2003 2002: 122.2 million and gross borrowings of 300.0 million 2002: 244.5 million.
Included within gross borrowings is 119.8 million 108.8 million of 2 per cent convertible bonds due in 2006.
These bonds were issued on 15 May 2002.
Also included within gross borrowings is 89.5 million US$160 million 2002: 99.4 million US$160 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000.
These notes are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2003, the Group has undrawn committed facilities of 200.0 million 2002: 168.7 million.
Further details are given on page 65.
Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings, excluding the convertible bond but including the unsecured loan notes referred to above, are at floating rates.
The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to the unsecured loan notes from fixed into floating rates.
The Group has in place cash pooling arrangements in a number of territories.
These enable the Gr0up to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
An analysis of the interest rate risk profile of the financial liabilities and assets of the Group is given opposite.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk Trade credit risk is managed in each territory through the use of credit checks on new clients and individual credit limits, where considered necessary.
In some instances, clients are required to pay for media in advance.
Short-term debtors and creditors and currency disclosures Short-term trade debtors and trade creditors have been excluded from all disclosures provided in this note.
Group companies do not have material, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currencies.
Hence, no currency risk disclosures have been provided.
Analysis of currency and interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities of the Group The currency and interest rate risk profile of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 December was: Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total financial financial financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 m m m m m m Sterling 64.5 64.5 7.0 7.0 Euro 118.2 0.9 119.1 106.6 0.8 107.4 US dollar 89.2 89.2 113.6 113.6 Other currencies 23.7 23.7 13.413.4 118.2 178.3 296.5 106.6 134.8 241.4 Interest is payable on the above floating rate financial liabilities excluding the US unsecured loan notes based on the inter bank offer rate in each country.
The weighted average interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2003 was 3.28% 2002: 2.8%.
The variable interest rate payable on the US unsecured loan notes is based on the prevailing US LIBOR rate.
Interest on the convertible bond, which after hedging comprises all of the fixed rate financial liabilities, is fixed at 2% with a 1.875% premium payable fixed until May 2006.
Issue costs to be amortised in respect of the convertible bond at 31 December 2003 are 1.6 million 2002: 2.2 million of which 0.7 million 2002: 0.7 million is included in creditors: amounts falling due within one year.
In addition to the liabilities above, the Group had creditors due after more than one year of 33.3 million 2002: 22.8 million on which generally no interest is paid representing deferred consideration on acquisitions, the weighted average maturity period of which is 2.5 years and finance lease obligations of 0.1 million 2002: 1.1 million.
Analysis of the currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets of the Group The currency and interest rate risk profile of the financial assets of the Group at 31 December was: Cash at Cash at bank and bank and in hand in hand 2003 2002 m m Sterling 1.0 0.1 Euro 76.1 86.3 US dollar 34.4 12.0 Other currencies 35.9 23.8 147.4 122.2 Floating rate cash earns interest based on the relevant national LIBID equivalent.
In addition to the financial assets above, the Group had other fixed asset investments of 4.1 million 2002: 2.8 million principally in US dollars, which do not yield an interest-related income and which do not have a fixed maturity date.
64 10666.01 Pages 56-72 14 04 2004 19:45 Page 65 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2003 22.
Financial instruments continued Fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups 2.5 million fixed asset investment in Harris Interactive Inc and the interest rate swap on the Groups US$ loan notes which is not included in the balance sheet, there are no material differences between the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets or liabilities.
The fair value of the Groups investment in Harris Interactive Inc at 31 December 2003 was 5.1 million based on market values.
The fair value of the swap at 31 December 2003 was 12.1 million based on a discounted cash flow model and yield curves applicable 2002: 16.8 million.
This fair value represents unrecognised profits which the Group expects to realise as a result of lower variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan notes.
4.9 million of this unrealised profit is expected to be realised in 2004.
The cumulative aggregate gains that are unrecognised at the balance sheet date are 11.6 million.
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out in notes 15, 16 and 20.
With the exception of the Groups other fixed asset investments of 2.8 million, all financial assets have a maturity of less than one year.
Borrowing facilities The Group had the following undrawn, committed bank borrowing facilities available at 31 December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2003 2002 m m Expiring within one year 100.0 140.1 Expiring between one and two years 28.6 Expiring between two and five years 100.0 200.0 168.7 Of the amounts disclosed above at 31 December 2003, 100.0 million expiring within one year may be extended annually by the Group until 2006.
Market risk At 31 December 2003, it is estimated that a general simultaneous parallel shift of 1% in interest would not alter 2003 profit before tax significantly.
It is also estimated that a strengthening of Sterling by 1% would reduce 2003 profit before tax by approximately 1.0 million.
Currency exposures No Group companies have material unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than that of the local functional currency.
Hedges of future transactions At 31 December 2003 and 2002, there were no material foreign exchange contracts to hedge against future transaction flows.
