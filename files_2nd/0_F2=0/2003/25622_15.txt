Since that date the Company has made grants under a number of share based payment arrangements, which are described below.

In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
Restricted shares The Group issued a number of tranches of restricted shares during the year.
These are treated as share options with a nil strike price for accounting purposes.
Under UITF 17, the intrinsic value at grant date is taken as the average cost price of shares held and is charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period.
The total cost in respect of restricted shares, which has been charged to the profit and loss account in 2003, is shown in note 20 on page 61.
Of this amount, 1,710,000 related to grants made in 2003.
Certain awards under the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Restricted Share Scheme are subject to performance criteria.
All criteria relate to some measure of profitability within the Group but can relate to any level of operation from an individual book of business to the consolidated Group result.
Performance criteria can be defined for groups of employees or individuals.
For FRED 31 purposes the fair value of the restricted shares is taken as the share price at grant date.
The cost to the P&L account is based on this fair value and also the expected likelihood of achieving any performance criteria where applicable.
For 2003 the profit and loss charge for the year would be reduced to 1,639,000.

Of the auditor's remuneration 120,000 2002: 86,000 arose in respect of the parent company.
Audit-related regulatory reporting Fees for audit-related regulatory reporting relate to services that are required to be carried out by the external auditor in relation to statutory and regulatory filings or engagements and can include the following: - Review of interim financial information.
- Reports or letters required to be provided by the external auditors under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, eg.
compliance with the Combined Code.
- Reporting required to be undertaken by the external auditor pursuant to the requirements of other regulatory bodies, eg.
Further assurance services These are services that are provided by an independent accountant but unrelated to the statutory audit.
In these cases the Group has or, in the case of the Group pension scheme, the trustees have discretion as to whether or not to appoint the external auditor, although in many instances the external auditor will be best placed to undertake the work due to its in-depth knowledge of the Group.
The following are examples of services that would generally be regarded as falling under the heading: - Audit of Group pension schemes.
- Work in connection with Class 1 Circulars and Listing Particulars.
- Non-regulatory reporting on internal controls or corporate governance matters, eg.
reports commissioned by the Group Audit Committee.
- Advice on accounting matters and reviews of Accounting Standards where these are unrelated to the statutory audit.
The Audit & Compliance Committee has a policy on the use of the external auditors for non-audit services to ensure that the auditors' independence is maintained and it is involved in the decisions on all such appointments over 50,000.
Each year a limit is set on the total fees that can be paid to the external auditor in relation to other services not referred to above.

16 Earnings per share i Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit after taxation and minority interests by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
ii Fully diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit after taxation and minority interests by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.
iii Basic earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
iv Fully diluted earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.
v Basic earnings per share, excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
vi Fully diluted earnings per share, excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.

Following this transaction the entire issued capital of Marot Participations was acquired by a new holding company, Courcelles Participations, as part of a shareholder restructuring.
Courcelles acquired Marot at fair value and consequently recognised goodwill on acquisition.
The Group exchanged its 31% shareholding in Marot for a 31% shareholding in Courcelles and 31,663,000 in cash.
UITF 31 issued in October 2001 provides the appropriate Group accounting treatment.
UITF 31 confirms that to the extent the Group retains an ownership interest in the underlying business of Marot, that retained interest including any related pre-transaction goodwill, should be consolidated at its pre-transaction amount.
UITF 31 prohibits the Group from recognising its share of the fair value of Courcelles on its balance sheet.
As a consequence the Group is required to treat the cash receipt from this transaction as a distribution from Courcelles which results in a negative carrying value for this investment.
FRS 9, Associates and Joint Ventures requires that this negative carrying value be regarded and presented as a liability even though no real liability exists.
The accounting treatment required by UITF 31 and FRS 9 does not reflect the true economic worth of this investment.

2003 2002 Total pension cost 000 000 UK 14,032 9,327 Overseas 5,488 4,303 19,520 13,630 The Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme is based in the UK and provides benefits based primarily on Final Pensionable Salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee administered fund separate from the Company.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Company.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last formal valuation of the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme was undertaken at 1st July, 2003 by a qualified actuary independent from the Group.
At that date, the market value of the schemes assets, excluding insured annuities, was 172.3m which represented 68% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in salary.
The most influential assumptions underlying the valuation of the scheme were that the investment return would exceed the annual rate of increase in pensionable salaries by 3% per annum and the annual rate of future price inflation by 4.5% per annum.
In addition, it was assumed that pensions would increase in accordance with the scheme rules.
A provision of 7,905,000 has been made at the balance sheet date and represents the excess of the accumulated pension costs over the amount funded.
The cost of contributions to the defined benefit scheme for the year was 13,157,000 inclusive of the amortisation of provisions and experience deficits amounting to 3,522,000.
The contribution rate has been determined using the projected unit credit method.
The principal overseas schemes are: a The JLT USA Incentive Savings Plan which is a defined contribution scheme.
Employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary up to a maximum allowed by law $12,000 in 2003 and the Group contributes at a rate of 75% of each 1% contributed by the employee up to a maximum employee contribution of 4%.
b The JLT USA Employee Retirement Plan which is a defined benefit scheme.
Pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The latest actuarial valuation was undertaken at 1st January, 2001, at which date the main assumption used to set the contribution rate was that the annual rate of investment return exceeded the annual rate of increase in pensionable earnings by 3.0%.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was US$38,815,000 and the actuarial value of these assets represented 119% of the accrued liabilities at that date.
A provision of 2,472,000 has been made at the balance sheet date and represents the excess of the accumulated pension costs over the amount funded.
The cost of the defined benefit scheme for the year was 304,000.
Since the date of the last formal valuation, stock markets have fallen very significantly and the assets of the Plan have not been immune to this general trend.
The liabilities of the Plan are valued using a discount rate that reflects market levels at the date of the valuation.
The fall in the Plans assets does not, in itself, change the estimate of the cost of providing the pension benefits promised which was based on the last formal valuations.
70 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31st December, 2003 32 Pension commitments continued FRS 17 disclosures Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 was issued in November 2000 as a replacement for SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.

However, this has subsequently been reviewed by the Accounting Standards Board and will not now be fully effective until accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January, 2005.
Accounting periods ending on or after the 22nd June, 2001 fall into the transition period for which certain additional disclosures are required.
The transitional arrangements for the year ended 31st December, 2003 require disclosure of assets and liabilities at that date calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 together with disclosure of the items which would appear in the profit and loss account and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, were the full requirements of FRS 17 in place.

At 31st December, 2003 the Group had contracts amounting to a principal value of 170,642,000 2002: 196,269,000. d Other financial commitments In the normal course of business the Group enters into forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps and options to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements on cash balances held.
At 31st December, 2003 the Group had outstanding contracts amounting to 177,676,000 2002: 272,075,000. e Legal and other loss contingencies Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims and legal proceedings principally consisting of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance reinsurance and consulting services.
UK GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Significant management judgement is required to comply with this guidance.
The Group analyses its litigation exposure based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to asses its potential liability.
On the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group.
However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any annual period could be materially affected by an unfavourable resolution of these matters.
f Guarantees As at 31st December, 2003, the Company has given no guarantees in respect of subsidiary companies indebtedness 2002: nil.
74 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31st December, 2003 34 Derivatives and other financial instruments Financial instruments This note contains disclosures as required under FRS 13, Derivatives and other Financial Instruments.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash, short term deposits, money market funds, negotiable money market investments, short dated bonds, borrowings, finance leases, loan notes and provisions in respect of property commitments.
Short term debtors and creditors other than borrowings have been excluded from the following disclosures.
As explained on page 23 of the Financial Review and pages 30 and 31 of the Directors Report, the Group enters into derivative transactions to manage the fluctuations in currency and interest earnings that arise from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps and interest rate options matched by underlying investments and revenue flows to manage these risks.
The Group finances its operations principally by the cash generated by operating companies and to a lesser extent by the use of borrowings and finance leases.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities consist of borrowings, finance leases, loan notes and provisions to cover property commitments.
The following table provides an analysis of the borrowings between fixed and floating elements: Other Weighted Total gross financial Weighted average Floating rate Fixed rate borrowings liabilities average time fixed Currency 000 000 000 000 fixed rate years Sterling 35 5,482 5,517 12,763 2.1% 0.9 Australian dollars 1,071 - 1,071 - - - US dollars - - - 1,946 - - Total as at 31st December, 2003 1,106 5,482 6,588 14,709 - - Sterling 111 10,259 10,370 13,295 2.1% 1.1 Australian dollars 838 - 838 - - - US dollars - - - 362 - - Total as at 31st December, 2002 949 10,259 11,208 13,657 - - Other financial liabilities represent property provisions under which no interest is paid.
Notes to the financial statements 75 Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 34 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Cash and investments consist of short-term deposits, negotiable money market investments, short dated bonds and money market funds.
The following table includes the interest rate hedges that were entered into by the Group.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at 31st December, 2003: 2003 2003 2002 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 000 000 000 000 Finance leases 1,102 1,102 905 905 Loan notes 263 263 303 303 Other borrowings overdrafts 5,223 5,223 10,000 10,000 Other financial liabilities property provisions 14,709 14,709 13,657 13,657 Cash and investments 500,962 500,971 422,528 422,598 Interest rate derivatives used to manage interest rate risk - 1,000 - 5,411 Foreign exchange options used to manage foreign exchange risk -- - 498 Foreign exchange forward rate contracts - 22,487 - 16,011 The fair value of property provisions and interest rate swaps have been calculated on the basis of present values of future cash flows using an appropriate discount reflecting market rates.
The fair value of cash, short-term deposits, negotiable money market investments, money market funds, bank borrowings and overdrafts are based on the carrying value of the instruments.
Short dated bonds are valued at market bid price.
The fair value of forward rate agreements, interest rate options, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange forward contracts are based on the market bid prices as at the balance sheet date.
Currency exposures As explained on page 23 of the Financial Review, the Groups major transaction exposure arises in respect of the US dollar revenue earned in the UK, where it accounts for approximately 48% 2002: 53% of total UK revenue.
The Group therefore adopts a prudent approach to the management of this exposure by maintaining a rolling hedging programme using forward contracts and options.
The currency exposure of the Groups net monetary assets liabilities is shown in the table below.
