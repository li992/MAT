Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK Accounting Standards.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benets have been adopted, which require additional disclosures in respect of retirement benets, as set out in note 20.
Application note G to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, which deals specically with revenue recognition, was issued in November 2003 and is applicable to the year ended 31 December 2003.
This has resulted in a change to the accounting policy for revenue recognition for the media intelligence businesses, with revenue being recognised on delivery to the client rather than in line with data collection activities.
Accordingly, the 2002 results have been restated and a prior year adjustment has been made increasing payments received on account and reducing reserves by 9.2m as at 1 January 2002.
The impact on the 2002 revenue and operating profit is nil.
The impact of this change in 2003 has been to increase revenue and operating profit by 0.9m.
A summary of the principal group accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is given below.
Basis of consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the results of Taylor Nelson Sofres plc and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2003.
The results of all subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of are accounted for under acquisition accounting rules and are included in the profit and loss account from the effective date of control.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities in which the group holds a long-term interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or more venturers under a contractual agreement.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method of accounting.
Associates are those undertakings, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the group holds a long-term participating interest and exerts a significant inuence.
The groups share of profits losses of associates is included in the group profit and loss account and the groups share of their net assets, together with goodwill arising on acquisition, is included in the group balance sheet.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on consolidation for acquisitions made since 1 January 1998 is amortised in equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life of up to 20 years, and charged to the profit and loss account.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and at any other time, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If an undertaking is subsequently sold, the appropriate unamortised goodwill or goodwill written off to reserves is dealt with through the profit and loss account in the period of disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at rates of exchange prevailing at the date the transactions were made.
Foreign exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account except for differences arising on the retranslation of loans taken out to finance overseas subsidiaries which are dealt with through reserves.
Financial statements of overseas operations are translated using the closing rate net investment method, except that profits and losses of overseas operations are translated at the average exchange rate applicable to the period.
Differences arising on translation of the net assets of overseas operations are dealt with through reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Revenue recognition Revenue and profits on short term projects are recognised on the completion of the project once the product has been delivered to the customer.
Costs incurred on these projects up to completion are included within work-in-progress.
Revenue and profits on long term or continuous projects are recognised on the satisfactory completion of each phase of the project once the product has been delivered to the customer.
Costs incurred on long term projects are included within work-in-progress until completion of each phase.
Amounts invoiced to clients in advance of revenue and profits being recognised are shown as payments received on account within creditors.
Provisions are made for losses on projects as soon as they are identied.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at the lower of cost or their recoverable amount, which is determined as the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Tangible and intangible fixed assets Fixed assets are stated at original cost or, where appropriate, fair value when acquired, less accumulated depreciation.
Assets under construction consist of costs directly attributable to purchasing and installing tangible xed assets ahead of their productive use.
External and internal costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance the future economic benets of the business.
Internal costs are only 32 TNS annual report and accounts 2003 capitalised if they are also incremental to the group.
Provisions are made and charged to the profit and loss account where the value of assets has been impaired in relation to their value-in-use to the business.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold land no depreciation Freehold buildings 33 years Short leasehold land and buildings period of lease Patents, licences and other 20 years or remaining life if shorter Goodwill 20 years or estimated useful economic life if shorter Software and databases 15 years or remaining life if shorter Leasehold improvements 10 years or period of lease if shorter Equipment 3 10 years No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until they are brought into use by the business.
Finance and operating leases Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives, or the term of the lease if shorter, at the rate applicable to xed assets of a similar category owned by the group.
Rentals under operating leases are charged directly to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Work-in-progress Work-in-progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct costs incurred on incomplete client projects and an appropriate element of attributable overheads.
Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pension arrangements The group operates a number of contributory pension plans.
The majority of employees participate in dened contribution plans that are set up through insurance companies.
Contributions are also made to personal pension plans at equivalent rates.
Payments in respect of such current service contributions for dened contribution plans and personal pension plans are charged in the financial statements as they fall due.
The group also operates dened benefit plans which provide pensions based on final salaries.
The expected cost of pensions in respect of these plans is charged to the profit and loss account, so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the plans.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the plan.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied independent actuaries.
Employee share ownership plans and QUEST see remuneration report on pages 73 to 79 Shares in Taylor Nelson Sofres plc held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and the Employee benefit Trust EBT have been included within xed asset investments and are stated at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in value.
Net operating income from the plans is included under interest receivable and similar income in the groups profit and loss account.
Costs of administration are included in the profit and loss account as they accrue.
profits arising on the disposal of shares held by the EBT as a result of the exercise of options are taken to other reserves.
Contributions made by the company to the QUEST in respect of SAYE options exercised during the year are charged directly to reserves.
Deferred consideration Where acquisitions involve further payments that are deferred or contingent on levels of performance achieved in the years following acquisition, the profit and loss account is charged with notional interest to eliminate the benefit which the group is temporarily saving.
The notional interest charged is calculated by reference to the period of deferral, current interest rates and the amount of the likely payments.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Tax deferred or accelerated by the effect of timing differences is accounted for to the extent that a transaction or event that has occurred at the balance sheet date gives rise to an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profits will arise from which the reversal of the asset can be deducted.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to uctuations in interest rates on borrowings.
Receipts and payments on such instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument.
Provisions A provision is recognised when there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
the sixth sense of business 33 2 Geographic analysis In the opinion of the directors, the group has only one class of business, which is the provision of market information services.
On 10 July 2003, the group acquired NFO WorldGroup, Inc. NFO.
Given the extent of integration that had occurred by the end of 2003, it has been increasingly difficult to isolate the results for the original TNS and NFO businesses, particularly with respect to costs.
Consequently it is not possible to give operating profit numbers for the original businesses.
For this reason, the results of NFO have been included within continuing activities.
An indication of the level of turnover attributable to NFO since the acquisition is 162m.
Other acquisitions have contributed 2.3m to turnover and 0.3m to operating profit before goodwill charges and integration costs.

The group expects to use these losses in the foreseeable future.
There are no unprovided deferred tax liabilities in the company or group.
Deferred tax assets of 2.3m 2002 nil in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to insufficient certainty over their recoverability.
There are no other factors expected to affect the groups tax rate going forward.

The amount waived in respect of the 2003 interim dividend was 17,000 2002 22,000 and the maximum to be waived in respect of the 2003 final dividend on shares currently held by the ESOP is 36,000 2002 39,000.
The trustees of the EBT have also waived their right to all but 0.001p per share of the dividends due on the 5.3 million shares the EBT holds at 31 December 2003, until further notice.
The amount waived in respect of the 2003 interim dividend was 62,000 2002 67,000 and the maximum to be waived in respect of the 2003 final dividend on shares currently held by the EBT is 106,000 2002 127,000.
The final proposed dividend does not include a dividend on shares issued on the exercise of employee share options and allotment of new shares since 31 December 2003 or on other options which may be exercised prior to 28 May 2004, the record date.
9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated on the profit after taxation and minority interests of 12.9m 2002 12.4m and on 413.1 million shares 2002 380.6 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the EBT, which are treated as cancelled.
The diluted earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 14, with the weighted average number of shares in issue being adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares for the period they were outstanding.
38 TNS annual report and accounts 2003 9 Earnings per share continued Shares held by the ESOP and the EBT, which are under performance-based options, are included in the diluted weighted average number of shares, as the performance conditions are deemed to have been met for the purposes of this calculation.
The diluted weighted average number of shares is 419.0 million 2002 386.6 million.
Adjusted earnings per share before goodwill charges and integration costs have been calculated on the profit after taxation and minority interests of 43.2m 2002 32.6m, which excludes goodwill charges of 23.9m 2002 20.2m and integration costs of 6.4m net of tax, and on the basic weighted average number of shares.
The directors believe that earnings per share before goodwill charges and integration costs assists in understanding the underlying performance of the group.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the purpose of these calculations is as follows: 2003 2002 Weighted average number of shares millions Share capital 421.6 390.4 Shares held by ESOP 1.9 2.6 Shares held by EBT 6.6 7.2 Basic earnings per share denominator 413.1 380.6 Dilutive effect of share options 5.9 6.0 Dilutive earnings per share denominator 419.0 386.6 10 Intangible fixed assets Patents Goodwill and licences Other Total Group m m m m Cost At 1 January 2003 214.1 5.1 1.4 220.6 Exchange differences 28.7 0.1 0.1 28.5 Acquisitions 0.6 0.6 Additions note 12 242.9 242.9 Disposals 0.1 0.5 0.4 1.0 At 31 December 2003 428.2 4.7 1.7 434.6 Amortisation At 1 January 2003 38.9 2.1 1.0 42.0 Exchange differences 1.7 0.1 0.1 1.5 Charge for year 16.8 0.4 0.1 17.3 Impairment 6.5 6.5 Disposals 0.4 0.4 0.8 At 31 December 2003 60.5 2.2 0.8 63.5 Net book value At 31 December 2003 367.7 2.5 0.9 371.1 At 31 December 2002 175.2 3.0 0.4 178.6 In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill, the carrying value of the goodwill held in respect of a number of the groups subsidiary undertakings has been compared with their recoverable amounts represented by their value in use to the group.
The review has resulted in an impairment charge of 3.4m in respect of Tellex, a UK Media Intelligence business, 2.4m in respect of TNS Sweden and other impairments totalling 0.7m 2002 impairments of 6.3m.
The discount rate used in the calculations to arrive at the valuations is 9% 2002 between 9% and 12%.
The company has no intangible xed assets.
At the end of 2002, costs of 0.7m for assets under construction were included within software and databases.
The company has no tangible xed assets.
12 Acquisitions Acquisition accounting has been adopted for all 2003 acquisitions.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions in 2003 is being amortised over a 20 year period, except for negative goodwill of 0.4m arising on the acquisition of EOS, which is being amortised over a 2 year period in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangibles.
i Acquisition of NFO WorldGroup, Inc. NFO On 10 July 2003, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of NFO and 75% of the issued share capital of AISA, a subsidiary of the vendor operating in the Czech Republic, for $425m 261m.
$400m 246m of the consideration was paid in cash and $25m 15m by issuing new ordinary shares to the vendor.
The acquisition was nanced by new credit facilities and the placement of 39.1m new ordinary shares on 14 May 2003, which raised 52.0m see note 23.
A further $10m 6m consideration is payable in cash if the Taylor Nelson Sofres plc TNS average share price is greater than 146 pence for 20 consecutive trading days between 10 June 2004 and 9 August 2004.
This amount has been provided for and is included within provisions.
Acquisition expenses of 9.1m have been capitalised and are included in the total consideration paid of 283.5m.
A further 1.1m of expenses relating to the placement have been offset against the share premium account.
The 5.6m of costs for arranging the nancing of the acquisition have been capitalised and are being amortised over the period of the related finance.
The NFO acquisition was completed on a cash and debt free basis.
To achieve this, an existing loan of $127m 78m owed by NFO to the vendor was assigned to TNS as part of the terms of the acquisition.
In addition, TNS reimbursed the vendor for the net cash held by NFO at the date of acquisition.
The summarised profit and loss account for NFO for the prior year, and for the period from 1 January 2003 to 9 July 2003 are shown opposite.
These gures are taken from the management accounts of NFO and are stated on a US GAAP basis in US dollars.
The post acquisition 2003 results for NFO may not be indicative of the underlying results for NFO, due to the rapid integration process with existing TNS businesses that has been undertaken since the date of acquisition.

1 Goodwill and client lists of 126.3m have been written down to nil.
Panel set up costs of 4.3m have been written off in line with group accounting policies.
2Freehold land and buildings have been revalued following external valuations, resulting in an increase of 1.4m in net book value.
The expected useful life of computer equipment has been changed to three years in line with group accounting policies, resulting in a write down of 1.5m.
3 The carrying value of associates has been revalued resulting in a write down of 2.0m.
4 NFO revenue recognition has been aligned with group policies, whereby revenue is only recognised on the completion of a job or phase of a job and delivery of the product to the customer.
This has resulted in the creation of work-in-progress of 43.1m, which represents costs incurred on jobs not completed at the acquisition date that had been charged to the profit and loss account under NFO accounting policies.
5 Additional bad debt provisions of 1.0m have been provided and deferred tax assets of 2.0m have been set up relating to revaluations made as part of the fair value exercise.
Accrued revenue has been reduced by 30.7m to exclude revenue that had been recognised at the date of acquisition on incomplete jobs.
Deferred tax assets of 6.1m have been set up relating to the revenue recognition adjustment.
6 Accruals of 4.6m have been set up to reect liabilities at the acquisition date.
The assignment of the 77.9m $127m loan owed by NFO to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. IPG, the vendor, to Taylor Nelson Sofres plc and forgiveness of amounts owed to IPG of 21.5m $35m have reduced creditors by 99.4m.
Fees in advance have been increased by 25.0m to defer invoiced revenue on incomplete jobs.
7 Pensions and post employment provisions have been increased by 3.2m following revaluations at the acquisition date.
Provisions for vacant property and dilapidations of 4.9m have been set up to reect property related liabilities at the acquisition date.
At the date of acquisition, NFO had 3.8m of reorganisation provisions relating to restructuring announced at least 12 months prior to the acquisition.
Cash flow since acquisition As with the profit and loss account for the year, due to the progress of integration of NFO with TNS businesses, it is not possible accurately to separate out the NFO and TNS cash ows since the acquisition.
ii Other acquisitions On 28 July 2003, the group purchased 80% of the issued share capital of Data Advanced Research, a market information company in Central America.
On 11 July 2003, the group gained control of European Omnibus Survey EOS, an investment previously classied within other investments, following key board changes.
On 1 January 2003, the group purchased the remaining 25% minority interests in its subsidiaries, Piar and Siar, which operate in Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe respectively.
The group also purchased the remaining minority interests in its Portuguese subsidiary, Euroteste, and its Spanish subsidiary, Demoscopia, in the year.
The total consideration for these acquisitions was 1.7m.

Deferred consideration represents amounts that the group is contractually bound to pay in the future for acquisitions.
The amounts are determined by future results of the acquired businesses or by TNS share price performance.
The provisions are determined with reference to the latest information available and are expected to be paid within one to three years of the balance sheet date.
A provision of 6.1m $10m for deferred consideration payable relating to the acquisition of NFO has been created in the company and an additional 0.6 m of exchange differences have arisen in the year.
This is payable in cash if the TNS average share price is greater than 146 pence for 20 consecutive trading days between 10 June 2004 and 9 August 2004.
Pension provisions are calculated from actuarial valuations of dened benefit plans or retirement benefit plans across the group.
The provisions will be satisfied over the current service lives of employees.
Post employment benefit provisions are calculated from actuarial valuations of post employment benefit plans across the group and will be satisfied over the lives of the members.
The total pensions and post employment benets provision of 12.4m at 31 December 2003 consists of 7.8m 2002 2.2m of pension provisions, 1.8m 2002 nil of post retirement benets and 2.8m 2002 nil of statutory severance provisions payable when staff leave in certain territories.
Restructuring provisions consist of provisions acquired with NFO of 2.8m and 1.1m, relating to the reorganisation and integration of the TNS and NFO businesses.

These costs all relate to NFO reorganisations carried out before the business was acquired by the group.
The TNS reorganisation provision consists mainly of severance costs and will be satisfied in 2004.
Vacant property provisions represent the net rental cost to the group of empty leasehold properties up to the end of the relevant lease periods.
The provisions are expected to be utilised by 2013.
Other provisions consists largely of panel incentives of 6.2m and closure costs of 1.1m.
The remaining provisions consist of liabilities arising as a result of ongoing litigation or claims and other amounts that are not individually material to the group.
The amounts are expected to be paid within one to five years.
48 TNS annual report and accounts 2003 19 Financial instruments TNS operates a central treasury function providing services to the group.
It arranges loans and funding, invests surplus liquidity and manages financial risk.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and no speculative trades are permitted or executed.
It operates within specic policies, agreed by the board, to control and monitor financial risk within the group and reports regularly to the board against these policy requirements.
Monthly reports to the board summarise new Treasury activity and measures of effectiveness.
Prudent and controlled use is made of financial instruments where appropriate, principally to reduce uctuation in interest costs.
Forward exchange contracts and options are used to reduce uctuation in exchange rates.
Transactions are effected with relationship banks as counter parties.
For the purposes of the disclosures which follow in this note, short term debtors and creditors and provisions which arise directly from the groups operations have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments that play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk prole of the group.
An analysis of the carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is given in the fair value table on page 51.
Currency risk The group's principal exposures to exchange rate uctuations arise on the translation of overseas net assets and profits into sterling for accounting purposes.
The principal foreign currencies for the group are euro and US dollar.
The group's transactional foreign exchange exposure results mainly from sales and purchases of services between members of the group and is hedged by matching cash ows through a netting process.
Any significant residual exposures are covered on a short term basis by spot or forward exchange contracts.
Translation exposures arising on consolidation of the group's overseas net assets are reduced by broadly matching assets with borrowings in each major foreign currency.
This provides a hedge against currency uctuations by matching currency loans with the underlying assets in the same currency.
The net movement in exchange reserves after the effect of hedging is a loss of 19.4m after taxation 2002 loss of 6.6m.
The risk of currency translation of profits denominated in foreign currency is partly mitigated by the use of option contracts.
In 2003 the financial effect of such items was immaterial.
Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to variations in interest rates on its borrowings and manages these by xing debt through drawings of loans for extended periods and the use of interest rate hedging products such as swaps and forward rate agreements.
Group Treasury policy requires between 25% and 75% of borrowings to be maintained at xed rates.
However, to benefit from the current low levels of interest rates, the board has approved an increase in the maximum level of xed rate debt to 100%.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to uctuations in interest rates on borrowings.
Receipts and payments on such instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument.
A 1% rise in interest rates would effect the overall interest charge as follows: GBP, no change 2002 0.2m reduction : US, 0.4m increase 2002 0.4m increase : euro, 0.6m increase 2002 0.2m increase.
Liquidity risk The group maintains a balance between certainty of funding and a exible, cost effective structure.
Policy therefore dictates at least 20% capacity based on current debt prole be maintained.
At 31 December 2003, 490m 2002 250m of committed facilities and 53m 2002 60m of uncommitted facilities were available to the group.

the sixth sense of business 51 20 Pensions and similar obligations The group operates a number of pension and post retirement benefit plans for its employees throughout the world, as well as complying with local laws and regulations relating to the payment of retirement benets.
The assets of all funded pension plans are held separately from those of the group.
Total provisions in respect of the groups pension and post retirement benefit plans are shown in note 18.
UK The pension plans in the UK are primarily dened contribution plans and the group's contribution to such plans ranges from 4% to 8% of salary, rising with the age of employees.
There are two dened benefit plans which are closed to new members and future accruals.
Both plans were valued by independent qualied actuaries in 2001 using the projected unit method.
The market value of assets of these plans was 3.6m, which represented 172% of the benets that have accrued to members.
The principal assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.8% and that salary increases would be 3.0% per annum.
Pension increases were assumed to be nil.
The cost in the year for dened contribution plans was 1.9m 2002 2.0m and for dened benefit plans was nil 2002 nil.
France Companies in France participate in state compulsory arrangements.
Regulations in France require that a lump sum be paid to employees on retirement, based on their final salary and the number of years service.
The provisions required to meet these amounts were assessed by independent qualied actuaries in 2003 and full provision has been made for the 2.1m 2002 1.5m liability identied.
Movements in the liability are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year they are identied.
US There are dened contribution pension plans in operation in the US, where the group undertakes to pay a contribution based on amounts paid by employees up to a maximum.
Costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the period they are incurred.
The group also operates three dened benefit plans including the NFOR plan, which was acquired with the NFO acquisition.
The NFOR plan was valued in 2003 by independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
Principal assumptions used were a discount rate of 6.25% and salary increases of 3.50% per annum.
Pensions increases were assumed to be nil.
The market value of assets of this plan was 5.9m which represented 54% of the accrued benets.
The CMR plan was valued by independent qualied actuaries in 2002 using the unit credit method.
The market value of assets of this plan was 1.2m, which represented 175% of the accrued benets.
The cost in the year for dened contribution plans was 1.2m 2002 0.1m and for dened benefit plans was 0.5m 2002 nil.
There are also unfunded post retirement healthcare and life assurance plans, which were acquired with NFO.
Liabilities have been calculated by independent qualied actuaries in 2003 using actuarial valuations.
The cost in the year was 0.1m 2002 nil.
Assumed healthcare ination rates are 9% at 31 December 2003 grading down to 5% in 2008 and thereafter.
Netherlands The group operates a dened benefit plan in the Netherlands.
This plan is insured, although indexation increases to pensions in payment remain the responsibility of the company.
Provision for these indexation increases is made based on actuarial assessments made by independent qualied actuaries in 2001.
The cost in the year was 0.5m 2002 0.6m.
Other countries Where there are local requirements to provide lump sum payments at the time employees retire, provision has been made based on local actuarial assessments.
The cost in the year was 0.5m 2002 0.3m.
