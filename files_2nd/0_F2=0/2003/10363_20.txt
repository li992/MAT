No goodwill amortisation or goodwill assets are attributable to discontinued operations in either the current or prior year.
The segmental analysis of the operating profit loss for 2002 has been restated due to a change in the basis of allocation of Group expenses to the divisions.
Under the new allocation, costs which are commissioned or incurred at a corporate level, but are business or divisional specific in nature, are allocated to the divisions.
The Directors have made the change because they believe it more accurately reflects the divisional results.
Included within divisional operating profits are the following amounts arising from the change in the basis of allocation of Group expenses: Banking and Securities 2.8m 2002: 3.4m : Healthcare 2.7m 2002: 2.8m : and Financial Services 1.4m 2002: 1.4m.
No amounts are attributed to discontinued operations in either the current or prior year.
The Group expenses have therefore reduced by 6.9m 2002: 7.6m.
Included within the current year Group expenses is income of 3.1m arising on the disposal of one third of the warrants held in relation to WebMD common stock note 25.
The Group expenses in 2002 included a 2.0m charge in respect of a one time pension payment for the executive Directors which, together with a brought forward provision of 1.7m, represented the compensation for a change to their terms and conditions in 2002.

CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITIONS Within the Banking and Securities Division, the Group completed two acquisitions which resulted in goodwill of 11.3m.

The consideration is payable in three instalments and is conditional upon the Company achieving numerous performance milestones, including numbers of qualifying sales, by 31 May 2005.
At the balance sheet date it has not been possible to determine the full extent to which this consideration will become payable and thus only that consideration which has been determinable has been recognised.
64 Misys Annual Report 2003 Crossmar Matching Service was acquired on 21 April 2003 for a cash consideration of $13.0m.
The goodwill amortisation in relation to the acquisitions and disposals made during the year are individually, and in aggregate, immaterial.

68 Misys Annual Report 2003 25 other current assets In January 2000 Misys Physician Systems entered into a five year strategic alliance with WebMD to provide internet based practice management and clinical transaction services to physicians in the US.
As part of this arrangement, and separate to the commercial terms thereof, Misys Physician Systems received the right to warrants for up to 4.4 million shares of WebMD common stock, contingent on certain performance requirements, vesting over a four year period.
In January 2002 all the earlier agreements were terminated by mutual consent.
They were commuted into a new three year Transaction Processing Agreement TPA and related Warrant Agreement over two million warrants, vesting over a three year period, effectively settling all amounts outstanding under earlier trading arrangements.
The TPA was the subject of a formal amendment in December 2002.
During the year, one third of the warrants vested and as a result the Group received 3.1m in cash, representing the market value of the warrants at the date of vesting.

This was partly used to refinance existing indebtedness, with the balance available to finance future corporate activity.
The five year Eurobond is a 750m, fixed rate bond issued by Misys International Finance Limited and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
The bond bears interest at 6.37%, but the net funding raised has been converted into floating rate US dollar denominated debt through a series of interest rate and currency swaps.
J P Morgan Europe Limited contracted to subscribe on maturity of the bond or on its earlier redemption up to 750m for an issue of up to 750 million 1 preference shares by Misys International Finance Limited.
J P Morgan Europe Limited has sold its rights and obligations with regards to these preference shares to Interval Limited, a company that is independent of the Group.
Misys International SA, a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, paid 370m as an initial payment to Cordon Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Interval Limited.
This figure represents the discounted price which will be supplemented by a further payment of 232m in December 2006, for the rights to the preference shares noted above.
Misys Finance Limited, also a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, currently has a balance of 130m 2002: 130m deposited with Interval Limited at an interest rate of 4.54%.
This may be recalled at any time upon giving up to 13 days notice.
The Group has the ability to insist on a net settlement of the rights and obligations arising out of the above transactions.
There are no circumstances under which the Group would be obligated to redeem the bonds without being able to i offset the payment of 370m for the preference shares and ii recover the 130m deposit.
Accordingly the constituent elements of the above transactions have been offset in the Group balance sheet.
Similarly, as discussed in note 6, the constituent elements have been offset in the profit and loss account.
Issue costs of 7.7m were included in the original carrying value of the debt.
The amounts in the balance sheet have been stated net of unamortised issue costs of 1.1m 2002: 3.9m.
Finance costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying value of the net debt.
The bonds are guaranteed by Misys plc and other companies within the Group.
The bank loans are unsecured, denominated in sterling, and bear interest at a rate of 4.2%.
The loans were drawn down against a revolving credit facility of $150m.
The renewal of this facility was renegotiated during May 2003 and renewed with effect from 8 June 2003 with a maximum maturity of two years.
The Group is subject to certain financial covenants on its bank borrowings: these include a minimum ratio of operating profit, before depreciation and goodwill amortisation, to net interest: and a minimum ratio of operating profit, before depreciation and goodwill amortisation, to net debt.

Eagleye Solutions Limited was acquired in the year for a maximum consideration of 15.0m.
This consideration is payable in three instalments and is conditional upon the Company achieving numerous performance milestones by 31 May 2005.
The increase in contingent consideration represents the liability in relation to the acquisition of Eagleye Solutions Limited believed determinable at the balance sheet date.
These amounts will be settled in cash.
The property provisions comprise the net present value of the estimated future costs of vacant and sublet properties and the excess over market value for occupied properties of subsidiaries acquired in previous years.
The provision relating to vacant and sublet properties is expected to be utilised on average over the next seven years and the excess over market value provision over the next eight years.
The IFA networks provisions relate to the costs associated with the FSAVC and Pensions review processes, which are expected to be completed within a year.
Provision has been made based on the average historical cost of redress payments, together with expected administrative costs and external fees.
These amounts are partly recoverable from members and through insurance cover, and are shown gross of the recoverable element, with the corresponding entry in debtors.
A provision is also made for the expected value of the commissions reclaimable by product providers in respect of policies which may be cancelled during their indemnity period.
Included in other provisions are amounts primarily in respect of litigation and non property related onerous contracts.
The opening other provisions have been restated as a result of the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits note 36 and the change in presentation of the Groups IFA network provisions see below.
CHANGE OF PRESENTATION During the year, the Group made a change in the presentation of financial information in its IFA network provisions which relate to the expected value of the commissions reclaimable by product providers in respect of policies which may be cancelled during their indemnity period.
These provisions have previously been shown net of the amounts recoverable from Independent Financial Advisors, with movements in the net provision being shown as a cost of sale.
These are now being shown gross of the recoverable amounts, with the movement in the provision being taken through turnover and the corresponding recoverable amount through cost of sales.
Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
This change in presentation has resulted in an increase in turnover and cost of sales of 8.9m 2002: 4.9m and an increase in provisions of 24.4m 2002: 26.5m, other provisions of nil 2002: 0.9m, other debtors of 24.4m 2002: 32.1m and other creditors and accruals of nil 2002: 4.7m.
The effect on turnover has been reported through the Financial Services Division, within transaction processing, and United Kingdom segments in the analyses in note 1.
These changes have been made to provide a more appropriate presentation of the underlying arrangements and therefore of the Groups results and financial position.

72 Misys Annual Report 2003 32 retirement benefits DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees.
The costs of these pension schemes were 11.7m 2002: 13.0m and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at either the beginning or the end of the financial year.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme for 24 UK employees.
In addition, the Group operates a number of other smaller defined benefit arrangements.
The Group has accounted for its pension costs in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits as detailed in note 36.
Since the main UK scheme is now closed to new members and the age profile is increasing, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 May 2002: this has been updated to 31 May 2003 by qualified independent actuaries.
The last full triennial actuarial valuations of the other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31 May 2003 by qualified independent actuaries.
With effect from 1 June 2003, the Group has increased its contributions to the main UK scheme up to a rate of 28.5% of pensionable salaries.
The principal assumptions used in the valuations of the schemes are: all figures in % 2003 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 5.5 5.8 5.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5 3.5 3.5 Discount rate 5.1 6.0 6.0 Inflation assumption 2.5 2.8 2.5 The year end assets liabilities in the schemes and the expected rate of return were: Long term Long term Long term expected expected expected rate of 2003 rate of 2002 rate of 2001 return Value return Value return Value %m %m % m Equities 7.4 14.0 8.0 14.8 8.0 15.7 Bonds 4.8 5.5 5.7 6.1 5.2 6.3 Cash 3.5 0.2 Total market value of assets 19.7 20.9 22.0 Actuarial value of liabilities 38.6 27.9 26.1 Recoverable deficit in the scheme 18.9 7.0 4.1 Related deferred tax asset 5.7 2.1 1.2 Pension liability 13.2 4.9 2.9 Movement in deficit during the year: all figures in millions 2003 2002 Deficit in scheme at the beginning of the year 7.0 4.1 Current service cost 0.4 0.3 Contributions paid 1.2 0.8 Other finance costs income 0.1 0.1 Actuarial loss 12.6 3.5 Deficit in the scheme at the end of the year 18.9 7.0 Included within amounts charged to operating profit is 0.4m 2002: 0.3m in respect of current service costs.

Included in the floating rate liabilities are 40.0m 2002: nil and $nil 2002: $nil drawn down under the revolving US dollar credit facility.
Fixed rate liabilities comprise convertible loan notes, other loans, property provisions and finance leases.
The liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise non interest bearing contingent consideration.
As a protection against adverse interest rate movements the Group has bought interest rate caps that will protect the Group, until March 2004, from the effect of an increase in US LIBOR above 6.5%.
These financial liabilities are disclosed in notes 26, 28 and 29.
Details of the Groups undrawn borrowing facilities at 31 May 2003 are given in note 28.
FINANCIAL ASSETS Financial assets comprise cash deposits and fixed asset investments.
Cash which bears interest at nominal rates comprises 40.2m 2002: 41.3m denominated in sterling, 9.6m 2002: 12.5m in US dollars, 10.1m 2002: 1.3m in euros and 5.6m 2002: 15.0m in other currencies.
Cash deposits of 44.3m 2002: 24.3m denominated in sterling, accrue interest at rates based on LIBOR.
All cash and deposits are available on demand.
Fixed asset investments of 2.8m 2002: 2.2m comprise contractual rights to receive financial assets from participating in US and European Technology Funds which are non interest bearing.
Full details of these assets are given in note 20.
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidated sale, excluding accrued interest.
Market values, where available, have been used.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates with the exception of convertible loan notes and fixed asset investments.
Short term financial instruments are assumed to have a fair value equal to book value.
The book value is the amount recorded in the balance sheet.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been fair valued, based on the market price of comparable derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
No market exists for trading in the US and European Technology Funds in which the Group participates and future cash flows cannot be predicted.
As a result, a fair value cannot be established and therefore it has been assumed that their fair value is equal to book value.
The fair value of the WebMD Corporation warrants note 25 has been established using the Black Scholes model.

CURRENCY EXPOSURES To ensure compliance with the Groups treasury policy, as explained in the Financial Review, the Groups policy is to hedge currency exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
All the material assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation involved are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts, with the exception of foreign currency borrowings treated as a hedge against foreign net investments, and the initial payment of 370m made by Misys International SA MISA to Cordon Limited in 2002 note 28, the functional currency of MISA being US dollars.
Therefore, the Group has no material currency exposures requiring disclosure.
com 75 Notes to the financial statements continued HEDGES Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off balance sheet unrecognised and on balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of interest rate caps and forward foreign currency contracts used as hedges at the end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the forward contract rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below.

Any gains losses on these swaps will be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in future years.
34 contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities which are quantifiable comprise property rental guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounting to 8.5m 2002: 9.7m.
The Company has entered into a netting arrangement with its bankers, under which the Companys liabilities may be offset by the funds of other Group undertakings.
The Directors are of the opinion that this arrangement does not have a material impact on the results and financial position of the Company.
Within the Financial Services Division, the regulatory requirements governing the IFA network business receive significant attention.
Compliance with these regulations is subject to a process of ongoing review and appraisal by both the Financial Services Authority FSA and the Directors.
The general level of complaints made by consumers about advice given by their IFA has risen over the last year and our network members have not been immune from this trend.
This is due to increased consumer awareness and recent poor stock market conditions reducing investment values and likely returns.
In line with other networks and directly regulated IFAs we have had to allocate additional resources to handle these complaints.
It is not possible to quantify if additional levels of redress to consumers will be required although in many cases these costs, if they arise, will be covered by insurance.
The costs of handling these complaints are treated as an ongoing cost of doing business.
One network member of Kestrel Financial Management Ltd is still subject to a specific review.
An initial review has been performed on a sample of cases and the findings of this review are currently being discussed with the FSA.
A provision was made in 2001 in respect of the estimated costs of performing the review and all costs incurred to date have been charged against this provision.
No provision has been made in respect of any potential liability for redress or the costs of any potential regulatory action, as at present it has not been established that a liability exists.
In addition, the Board believes that if a liability does arise, insurance cover may be available to offset some of the liability.

Included in net exchange adjustments are exchange losses of 13.4m 2002: 0.6m arising on borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies designated as hedges of net investments overseas.
During the year, the Company received 39,000 in respect of shares issued when savings related options were exercised through the Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
Employees paid 18,000 to the QUEST for these shares and the Company contributed 21,000.
The Companys profit for the year is 79.8m 2002: 69.9m, which includes auditors remuneration of nil 2002: nil.
Due to an internal reorganisation during the year, the Company generated a profit of 17.7m on the internal disposal of one of its subsidiaries.
This profit is non distributable and will remain as such whilst the entity is part of the Group.
During the year 21,862,445 ordinary shares were purchased by the Company representing 3.8% of the issued share capital of Misys plc for a total cost, including expenses, of 40.2m.
These shares were subsequently cancelled, with a nominal value of 0.2m transferred to a capital redemption reserve and profit and loss reserves reduced by 40.2m.
PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENT FOLLOWING ADOPTION OF FRS 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS The adoption of FRS 17 has resulted in a change of accounting policy for retirement benefits.
Under the previous arrangements these assets and liabilities were held off balance sheet.
Under the new policy, the schemes deficit is held on the balance sheet with the profit and loss account charged with the current service cost within operating profit and related interest in a new note other finance costs.
