b Borrowing facilities The Group has various available borrowing facilities.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st March 2003, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows: 2003 2002 m m Expiring in one year or less 39 Expiring in more than two years 396 270 396 309 c Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair values of the financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of all swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of all other items has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The following summarises the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: Financial assets cash deposits and marketable investments The book value and the fair value equate due to the short-term nature of the investments.
Financial liabilities The book value of long-term borrowings amounts to 770 million 2002 594 million whereas the fair value amounts to 824 million 2002 607 million.
The movement from last year is mainly due to lower long-term US dollar and Euro interest rates.
The difference between fair value and book value is due to the fixed rates of interest paid on long-term debt.
The book values and the fair values of all other financial liabilities, including non-interest bearing creditors and contractual provisions, are not materially different.
Derivative financial instruments Included in long-term borrowings above are cross currency swaps with a negative book value of 14 million 2002 50 million and a positive fair value of 7 million 2002 51 million.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is 5 million receivable 2002 4 million payable.
These are not recognised in the financial statements in 2003 and 2002.
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts equated with the book value in both 2003 and 2002. d Hedges The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures within the parameters set out in the Finance Directors Review in the Annual Review: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Foreign currency transaction exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
Energy exposures using commodity swap contracts for the appropriate fuel.
Gains or losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
