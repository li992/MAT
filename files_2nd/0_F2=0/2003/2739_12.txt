In India and Bangladesh absolute title to any hydrocarbon reserves is vested in the host government.
However, under the terms of the PSCs, Cairn is entitled to receive a share of the hydrocarbon production and associated revenues.
Group reserves have, therefore, been presented both on a direct entitlement basis and a direct working interest basis.
The direct entitlement basis takes into account projections of government share of production calculated in accordance with certain price and expenditure assumptions.
Direct working interest basis is Cairns share of production calculated by reference to our joint venture participating interest as shown in the Principal Licence Interests on page 36.
Sale of reserves in place relates to the disposal of the Groups Dutch assets during the year.
