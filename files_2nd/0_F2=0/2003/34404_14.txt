10 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Accounting charge SSAP 24 Vita companies continue to provide pension benefits for many employees by contributing to a variety of pension arrangements in addition to those provided by the State.
In compliance with the Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24 SSAP 24 'Accounting for Pension Costs', the cost of these additional benefits is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Any difference between this charge and the actual contributions payable to external funds is shown on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
It is the Groups objective to fund pension arrangements by a substantially level contribution rate.
The total pension charge for the year was 9.0m 7.3m.
Defined Benefit Schemes Within the UK, the majority of employees are eligible to join one of two schemes, administered by British Vita Pension Fund Trustees Limited and British Vita SE & D Pension Fund Trustees Limited, which provide defined benefits from separately invested assets.
The schemes are funded in accordance with the recommendations of the consultant actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The members of the schemes are contracted-in to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme but members have the option of contracting-out via a Rebate Only Personal Pension Scheme.
All members receive an annual benefits statement, together with a copy of an annual report on the status of the appropriate scheme.
An actuarial valuation is undertaken every two years and the last valuation was performed at 31 March 2002 using the projected unit method, which is consistent with the method used for the SSAP 24 valuation.
The key assumptions used were excess annual investment returns over gilt returns of 1.5% pre-retirement and 0.5% post-retirement, valuation rate of annual interest of 6.5% pre-retirement and 5.5% post-retirement, rate of annual pensionable pay inflation of 5.2% to 6.2% and annual rate of pension increase of 3.0%.
The market value of assets was 244.8m.
The schemes were funded to a level between 126% and 131% of the accrued liabilities at the date of the valuation.
Separate pension arrangements are still operated by some of the acquisitions made in prior years, the largest of which is the Hyperlast Limited Retirement Benefits Plan.

com 10 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS continued Defined benefit schemes are also provided to employees in France and Germany, supplementing the state pension provision.
In France a lump sum indemnity is provided to employees reaching normal retirement age.
In accordance with local practice and as allowed under SSAP 24, this liability is unfunded and recognised only at retirement, except to the extent that the liability has been transferred to an insurance policy, in which case it is recognised on transfer.
Partial insurance provision exists in only one French business unit.
In Germany collective contracts provide for employees to receive either a single lump sum payment or a monthly pension on retirement.
In accordance with local practice and as allowed under SSAP 24, this liability is recognised at the time that the service is accrued, equal to the present value of future pension liabilities less the present value of notional premiums that would be payable for future service accrual if the liability has been insured.
The liability is provided for in the balance sheet and is unfunded.
Insured Defined Benefit Schemes Insured defined benefit pensions are provided to employees in the Netherlands and Austria.
In the Netherlands funds are paid into third party insurance policies as benefits accrue.
These policies provide guaranteed investment returns and the insurer bears the primary risk of asset return and mortality.
In Austria funds are insured through third parties with no investment risk borne by the Group.
For these policies, liabilities are recognised as benefits accrue and assets are held by third party providers.
Recognition of liabilities and funding of defined benefit and insured defined benefit schemes are made according to the advice of independent consulting actuaries who regularly review the various schemes.
Defined Contribution Schemes Defined contribution pension plans operate in the principal operations in the USA, Italy, Australia, Belgium and certain other countries.
Pension benefits are paid as lump sums or ongoing payments.
These benefits are funded and liabilities accounted for at the time that benefits accrue and all investment, mortality and other risk is borne by the employee.
Assets are held by third party providers.
FRS 17 disclosure UK Schemes The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Additional disclosures regarding the Groups principal two UK defined benefit pension schemes together with the Hyperlast Limited Retirement Benefits Plan are set out below.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at 31 December 2003 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The major assumptions for the actuarial valuation were: 2003 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 4.66% & 5.16% 4.33% & 4.83% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.66% & 3% 2.33% & 3% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.66% 2.33% Discount rate 5.36% 5.60% Inflation assumption 2.66% 2.33% The fair value of the assets in the schemes, the present value of the liabilities in the schemes and the expected rate of return at each balance sheet date were: 2003 2002 %m %m Equities 6.65 172.7 6.50 138.6 Bonds 5.15 62.3 5.00 63.0 Property 6.65 0.2 - - Total market value of assets 235.2 201.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 234.2 204.1 Scheme surplus deficit 1.0 2.5 Related deferred tax liability asset 0.3 0.7 Net pension asset liability 0.7 1.8 Annual Report 2003 45 Notes to the Accounts continued 10 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS continued The contribution rate for the principal two UK defined benefit pension schemes for 2003 to 2006 subject to periodic review by the scheme actuary is 9% to 18% of pensionable salaries depending on the pension scheme, inclusive of the schemes directly meeting the administration and related costs.
In 2002, the contribution rate was 3% to 6% and the Group incurred the administration and related costs of the schemes.
Hyperlast Limited contributed 0.3m to the scheme in the year to 31 December 2003 and has agreed to contribute at the rate of 15% of members pensionable salaries in 2004.

No historic data is available to quantify expected or experience data.
As identified under Accounting charge SSAP 24 above, the risks in the insured defined benefit schemes and the defined contribution schemes have materially been transferred from the Group.
As a result, only the defined benefit schemes in France and Germany are considered to fall within the remit of FRS 17.
These disclosures are set out below and are based on actuarial updates at 31 December 2003 provided by qualified actuaries using assumptions consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued at fair value.

B Currency exposures As explained on page 13 of the Operating and Financial Review, the Groups objectives in managing its structural currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas are to maintain a low cost of borrowing whilst partially hedging against currency movement.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Group does not hedge directly the translation exposure of the profit and loss account.
The table below shows the Groups transactional currency exposures: i. e. those exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investment in overseas operations.
As at 31 December 2003 these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities m m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling Euro US Dollar Other Total Sterling - 1.0 0.5 0.2 1.7 Euro - - - 0.1 0.1 Other 0.1 0.3 0.3 - 0.7 Total 0.1 1.3 0.8 0.3 2.5 The exposures at 31 December 2002 for comparison purposes were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities m m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling Euro US Dollar Other Total Sterling -0.20.20.10.5 Euro 0.5 - 0.1 - 0.6 Other 0.1 0.6 0.2- 0.3 Total 0.6 0.4 0.50.10.8 The amounts shown in the tables are net of the forward contracts arranged to manage currency exposures.
C Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, as follows: 2003 2002 m m Expiring in one year or less 14.0 114.9 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years - 25.0 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 119.0 - 133.0 139.9 Annual Report 2003 53 Notes to the Accounts continued 20 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued D Fair values The vast majority of Group debt is at floating rates, which are reset to market rates at frequent intervals.
The fair values of financial instruments were not materially greater or lower than the carrying value.
E Gains and losses on hedges Foreign currency transaction exposures are dealt with by the Corporate Treasury using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The market value of the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts at both 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 showed a small unrealised gain.
