Pension costs The group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits was issued in November 2000 but will not be mandatory for the group until the year ending 16 September 2006.
Prior to this, phased transitional disclosures are required and are set out in b. a Associated British Foods pension schemes The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type.
On 30 September 2002, the groups principal UK defined benefit schemes were closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements introduced for these members.
The pension costs in the UK are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
For the defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions paid.
The total pension charge for the year was 31m 2002 18m.
The last actuarial valuations of the British Sugar Pension Scheme and the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme were carried out as at 1 October 2001 and 5 April 2002 respectively.
Both valuations used a market related approach under which the actuarial values of the assets were taken as their market value at the valuation date.
The valuation assumptions also reflected market conditions at the respective valuation date.
For the British Sugar Pension Scheme, it was assumed that the investment return would exceed price inflation by 3.25% per annum.
For the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, the investment return assumption prior to retirement exceeded the price inflation assumption by 3.25% per annum and post retirement by 2.5% per annum.
In both valuations salary increases were assumed to exceed price inflation by 2% per annum.
At the valuation dates the total market value of the two major schemes assets was 1,722m and the value of these assets for actuarial valuation purposes represented 112% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following an informal review of the schemes funding levels conducted by the schemes actuaries in January 2003, the company decided to recommence contributions to the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme and to increase contributions to the British Sugar Pension Scheme.
These contributions were backdated to 15 September 2002.
The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the US, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland and the Philippines.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified local actuaries.

Pension costs continued b FRS 17 Retirement Benefits For the purposes of FRS 17 disclosures, the most recent actuarial valuations referred to above have been updated to 13 September 2003 by an independent qualified actuary.
The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2003 2002 2001 UK UK UK % %% Rate of general increase in salaries 4.50 4.25 4.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 2.25 2.50 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.50 2.25 2.50 Discount rate of scheme liabilities 5.25 5.50 6.00 Inflation 2.50 2.25 2.50 For some of the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
On 30 September 2002 the groups principal UK defined benefit schemes were closed to new members.
As a result, these schemes have an ageing population.
In accordance with FRS 17, the valuation of the schemes liabilities has been determined using the projected unit method.
In these circumstances the use of this method can lead to the contribution rate implicit in the current service cost increasing in future years.
The expected rates of return and market values of the assets of the principal schemes were as follows: UK schemes At year end At year end At year end At year end At year end At year end 13 September 13 September 14 September 14 September 15 September 15 September 2003 2003 2002 2002 2001 2001 %m %m % m Equities 7.00 631 6.75 504 7.25 1,150 Government bonds 4.75 589 4.50 564 5.00 66 Non-government bonds 5.25 407 5.50 496 6.00 343 Property 6.25 57 6.00 62 6.50 105 Other 3.50 77 4.00 35 5.00 18 Total market value of assets 1,761 1,661 1,682 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,708 1,520 1,326 Surplus in the schemes 53 141 356 Deferred tax 16 42 107 Net pension assets 37 99 249 58 Associated British Foods plc 4.
