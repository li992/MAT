Such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim roll-over relief.
The total amount unprovided for is approximately 6 million.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable, in respect of such properties, in the foreseeable future.

Interest rate and currency risks of financial liabilities The company has entered into a cross-currency swap in respect of the $140 million US senior loan notes.
The effect of this transaction is to remove any exposure to currency risk with regard to the settlement of this financial liability in 2009.
There is no foreign currency exposure.
An analysis of the interest-rate profile of the financial liabilities, after taking account of all interest-rate swaps and the crosscurrency swap on US senior loan notes, is set out in the following table.

The fixed-rate borrowings comprise floating-rate borrowings hedged using fixed-rate swaps with an effective weighted average interest rate excluding bank margin of 6.46% 2002: 7.08% and which are fixed for a weighted average period of 6.0 years 2002: 2.6 years.
In addition to the existing 97 million swaps, the company also has undrawn forward-starting swaps which fix 53 million of borrowings for a seven-year period at an average rate of interest excluding bank margin of 6.46%.
The weighted average period to maturity of non-interest-bearing liabilities is 2.1 years 2002: 2.2 years.

All UK committed loan facilities are at floating rates based on LIBOR.
The company has entered into swap agreements which fix 97 million of these borrowings at a rate of 6.46% excluding bank margin.
At the balance sheet date, 138 million was drawn down under the revolving-loan facilities, with interest rates set for periods of between one week and six months, at which point monies are repaid and, if appropriate, redrawn.
The undrawn facility expires in more than two years.
In addition to the UK facilities, in September 1999, the company issued $140 million unsecured US senior notes due in 2009, carrying a fixed rate of interest of 8.48%.
The company entered into currency and swap agreements covering the duration of these notes which remove all US dollar exposure and convert the interest rate to one based on LIBOR.
