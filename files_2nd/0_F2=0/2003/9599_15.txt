The use of such financial instruments constitutes part of the Groups funding strategy.
The Group manages its financial instrument credit risk by only undertaking transactions with relationship banks, holding good credit ratings.
Such transactions are governed by board policies and procedures.
As all the Groups operations are transacted in the reporting currency, there is no currency exposure.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.
Refinancing of group facilities During the period under review, the headroom of the Group was increased by 32.7m by the addition of a syndicated, revolving facility.
Interest rate risk The principal area of financial risk is interest rate risk.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Interest rate risk on borrowings is minimised by using interest rate swaps.
It is considered appropriate to have between 40% and 50% of debt facility at fixed rates, depending on the maturity profile of the Groups outstanding facilities.
