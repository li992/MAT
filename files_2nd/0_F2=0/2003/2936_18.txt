Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
On adoption of FRS 5 Application Note G: Revenue Recognition, the Directors have considered the Groups revenue recognition policies and believe them to be consistent with the requirements of the Application Note.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets comprising land and buildings, and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Following the announcement made by Network Rail on 24 October 2003 that it intends to terminate rail maintenance contracts by September 2004, the Directors have performed a review of the Groups rail maintenance business and its associated assets.
In light of the Network Rail contracts ending, an impairment of goodwill originally recognised on the acquisition of GT Railway Maintenance Holdings Limited has been made of 33.1m see Note 12.
In addition, there is a degree of uncertainty concerning the carrying value of certain fixed assets, stocks and debtors that relates to the Network Rail contracts.
At the date of approval of the financial statements, the potential transfer of these assets to Network Rail is subject to on-going discussions.
In the opinion of the Directors, the realisable value of these assets are not expected to be significantly different from their carrying values.
Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on the basis that there are no material adjustments required to the carrying value of these assets as at 31 December 2003.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December 2003.
Unless otherwise stated the acquisition method of accounting has been applied.
Under this method acquired subsidiaries are included from the date of acquisition.
Disposals are accounted for up to the date control passes to a third party.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets other than goodwill is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where a Group company is party to a joint arrangement that is not an entity, that company accounts directly for its share of the income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
Fixed asset investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment.
Company shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trust are included in both the Group and Company financial statements as a fixed asset investment until such time as the interest in the shares is transferred unconditionally to the employees.
The purchase costs of the shares are charged to the profit and loss account where they cannot be recovered so as to spread the costs over the relevant performance period of the plans.
Costs of administering the trust are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The ESOP trust is regarded as a quasi subsidiary under FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions and its assets, liabilities and results are consolidated into the financial statements of both the Company and the Group.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets of an acquired company or business, including an interest in a joint venture, is capitalised and amortised in equal annual instalments over its useful economic life.
Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves on acquisition.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, this treatment has continued to be applied for those years.
Any such goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in the calculation of any profit or loss on disposal in respect of businesses subsequently disposed of or terminated.
Any impairment arising on goodwill that has previously been written off to reserves is taken to the profit and loss account.
43 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Long term contract balances Amounts recoverable on contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses.
Payments received on account of contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on contracts in debtors or long term contract balances in stock.
Where such amounts have been received and exceed amounts recoverable the net amounts are included in creditors.
Profit recognition Profit on long term contracts is calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In determining the attributable profit on contracts to a particular accounting period the Group utilises estimation techniques.
The principal estimation technique used is the preparation of profit and cash flow forecasts on a contract by contract basis which enables an assessment to be made of the final out turn on each contract.
Profit is then recognised when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty and is attributed in line with the degree of completion of each contract.
The result for each year includes settlement of claims on contracts completed in prior years.
In preparing contract forecasts, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims is included in the assessment of the final out turn.
Property development profits are recognised on contractual completion.
Group turnover Group turnover represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied to external customers.
In respect of long term contracting activities, turnover reflects the fair value of work executed during each year.
It also includes the Groups proportion of work carried out under joint arrangements during the year.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tangible fixed assets The Group has continued to follow the transitional provisions of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets to retain the book value of freehold land and buildings, which were last revalued in 1985.
Depreciation is based on historical cost or revaluation, less the estimated residual values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets concerned.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold land and buildings 50 years Short leasehold land and buildings Period of lease Plant, machinery and vehicles 310 years Leased assets Operating lease rental charges are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included in tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the contract term or their useful life.
The capital element of outstanding finance leases and hire purchase contracts is included in creditors.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for each year and takes into account deferred taxation.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation.
Liabilities are calculated on a non-discounted full provision basis.
Assets are calculated on the same basis, but are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered.
44 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the contracted exchange rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the relevant balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of overseas undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Gains or losses arising on the translation of the opening net assets of such overseas undertakings are taken to reserves together with exchange differences on related foreign currency hedges.
Share incentive schemes Where share incentives are granted with an exercise price of less than the market price at the date of grant the difference is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to the exercisable date of the incentives.
Due regard is made to the likelihood of the stipulated performance criteria being attained with the charge being amended accordingly.
No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all or substantially all employees as permitted by UITF 17 Employee Share Schemes.
Pensions Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
Regular pension costs in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are established in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries and are charged to the profit and loss account based on the expected pension costs over the employees service lives with the Group.
Current actuarial surpluses or deficits are amortised over the average expected remaining service lives of current employees on a systematic basis.
The difference between the amounts charged or credited to the profit and loss account and the contributions made to the pension schemes is included within debtors or creditors as appropriate.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The Group continues to follow the transitional provisions as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement benefits at 31 December 2003 which are disclosed in Note 30.
Bid costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is appointed preferred bidder.
Provided the contract is expected to generate sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and the award of the contract is virtually certain, pre-contract costs incurred post the appointment as preferred bidder are included in stocks.
Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included in stocks.
Any excess recoveries are carried forward as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract to which the pre-contract costs relate.
Interest Interest is written off to the profit and loss account as incurred by all subsidiaries in the Group.
Interest incurred on borrowings within the Groups joint ventures relating to the construction of assets in PPP projects is capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.

The actual tax rate differs from the standard rate for the reasons set out below: 2003 2002 m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 23.8 42.2 Taxation on profit on ordinary activities at UK standard rate of corporation tax 7.1 12.7 Permanent differences 3.3 2.4 Other timing differences 5.8 0.2 Other timing differences not recognised 1.8 0.7 Overseas profits not taxable 0.7 0.5 Utilisation of overseas losses not previously recognised 0.9 1.0 Unrelieved trade losses in the year 1.3 0.2 Capital items not taxable 3.5 0.1 Amortisation of own shares 1.0 Amortisation and impairment of goodwill 10.6 0.7 Adjustment in respect of previous periods 2.6 1.1 Current taxation charge for the year 15.8 13.8 c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group has brought forward tax losses in excess of 87m which have not yet been fully agreed by the Inland Revenue.
In accordance with FRS 19 a deferred tax asset, valued in excess of 26m, has not been recognised in respect of these losses due to the lack of certainty regarding quantum and timing of future years taxable profits in the companies involved.
In the event that such profits are realised this may result in the Group tax rate being lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The tax rate in the joint venture companies in which the Group has PPP investments may be greater than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
This is generally due to capital expenditure not qualifying for tax relief.
As the PPP element of the Groups profit before taxation increases in future years it will have the effect of increasing the Groups tax rate above the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
This may be offset by the developing trend for composite trade tax treatment whereby all income and expenditure is treated as on trading account for tax purposes.

The goodwill relating to this acquisition is being amortised over four years which is the remaining period of the companys maintenance contract.
The impairment provision of 25.0m relates to the whole of the goodwill in respect of the rail maintenance business of GT Railway Maintenance Holdings Limited GTRM.
This impairment arises from the decision by Network Rail, announced on 24 October 2003, that it intends to take all rail maintenance contracts in-house by September 2004.
In addition, there is a further 8.1m impairment relating to goodwill that had previously been written off to reserves on the acquisition of 49% of GTRM in 1996 see Note 24.
The residual goodwill remaining in GTRM relates to its projects and renewals operations.
As from 1 January 2004, this will be amortised over six years as in the opinion of the Directors this is the minimum period over which the Group will derive economic benefit from the business.

During the year it was identified that 13.7m of subordinated loans invested in a number of PPP special purpose companies had been reported as equity investments in the financial statements for 31 December 2002.
In line with UK GAAP these subordinated loans, previously regarded as quasi-equity, are more properly disclosed as loan advances.
Accordingly, a transfer of 13.7m has been made from the cost of equity investments to loan advances within investments in joint ventures.
There is no impact on the Groups reported net assets as at 31 December 2002 or on the Groups cumulative share of retained profits in the PPP special purpose companies.
The Groups aggregate share of joint venture net assets is analysed below.
The borrowings within PPP projects totalling 516.0m 2002: 520.1m are without recourse to the Carillion Group.

In the Company, net obligations due under finance leases relate to financing agreements for fixed assets currently used by GT Railway Maintenance Limited and Carillion Fleet Management Limited, both wholly owned subsidiaries.
The assets have been recognised in the accounts of the subsidiaries in accordance with SSAP 21 Accounting for leases and hire purchase contracts, together with corresponding liabilities to Carillion plc.
Carillion plc recognises these inter-company debts within amounts owed by Group undertakings in Note 17.
Interest is charged on the above bank loans at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
All bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured.
Other loans and net obligations due under finance leases are secured on the assets to which they relate.
The maturity profile of all borrowings is disclosed in Note 21.
57 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21.
Financial instruments and risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments is to provide finance for its operations.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, include bank loans and overdrafts, cash and short term deposits and finance leases.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade debtors and trade creditors, arise directly from the Groups operations.
The Groups derivative transactions relate solely to forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policies with regard to financial instruments have remained unchanged throughout the year.
The Groups treasury department manages the main financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board.
These are discussed in detail below and in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 8 to 13 and are designed to reduce the financial risks affecting the Group.
The Groups treasury department does not enter into speculative financial transactions.
The Groups main financial risks are funding and liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Funding and liquidity The financial assets and liabilities of the Group may be summarised as follows: 2003 2002 Weighted Weighted average average period until period until maturity of maturity of Assets Liabilities liabilities Assets Liabilities liabilities m m years m m years Nil coupon: Sterling 0.7 3.1 2.6 2.9 9.6 1.8 Canadian dollars 8.5 5.3 0.1 1.5 European currencies 0.6 0.4 Other 3.0 1.6 1.5 2.6 1.7 1.5 12.8 4.7 2.2 11.2 11.4 1.8 Floating rate: Sterling 97.6 0.8 50.4 50.5 Canadian dollars 6.5 16.9 8.3 16.5 United States of America dollars 1.3 9.7 1.3 European currencies 17.4 19.6 19.5 12.7 Other 5.2 3.7 5.5 0.1 128.0 50.7 85.0 79.8 Fixed rate: Sterling 15.8 7.1 Canadian dollars 1.3 European currencies 0.1 0.2 Other 0.1 17.2 7.4 Total 140.8 72.6 96.2 98.6 Summary by currency Sterling 98.3 19.7 53.3 67.2 Canadian dollars 15.0 18.2 13.6 16.6 United States of America dollars 1.3 9.7 1.3 European currencies 18.0 19.7 19.9 12.9 Other 8.2 5.3 8.1 1.9 Total 140.8 72.6 96.2 98.6 58 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 21.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate financial liabilities is 5.4% 2002: 6.0%.
The weighted average period for which this interest is fixed is 7.4 years 2002: 6.5 years.
The Groups financial assets, which exclude short term debtors and pension prepayments, consist primarily of cash at bank and on deposit, that earn interest at money market related rates.
The financial assets on which no interest is earned are primarily trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts that are expected to be received in more than one year.
The Groups financial liabilities exclude short term creditors and deferred income relating to PPP bid cost recoveries.
Floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings that bear interest based upon money market or base rate related interest rates.
Fixed rate financial liabilities comprise other loans and finance lease and hire purchase contract liabilities.
The Groups consolidated cash position at the balance sheet date is not representative of the position at other times of the year.
Whilst material working capital movements and the resultant cash flows are a significant feature of the Groups cash profile throughout the year, a number of factors combine to exaggerate the year end position.
Such factors include a reduction in the demand for working capital over the extended holiday period, shorter daylight and therefore working hours and a traditional industry focus on the settlement of contractual claims.
Interest rate risk The Groups debt is predominantly currency borrowings for hedging against overseas investments and sterling borrowings related to working capital movements.
These borrowings are subject to floating rate interest charges.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken.
Currency exposure The Group has small and infrequent transactional currency exposures.
Group policy requires net exposures to be hedged using forward contracts or currency options as soon as a contractual commitment is made.
The Groups policy on hedging currency net assets is to hedge, where practical, at least 50% of the net asset value of overseas investments where such net assets exceed 10m equivalent.
Throughout the year hedging was achieved through currency borrowings and forward contracts.
There were no material unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for exchange rate hedging either during or at the end of the year.
At 31 December 2003 the total sterling value of currency borrowings for the purposes of hedging was 39.4m 2002: 16.5m.
The increase has arisen from new borrowings to hedge against investments in Europe and investments whose currencies are closely linked to the United States of America dollar.

Credit exposures on financial instruments arise through short term deposits and foreign exchange hedging.
Such transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly.
Fair values The book and fair values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 are not materially different.

This followed the successful re-financing of the joint venture in March 2003 which generated 10.8m of cash for the Group.
The carrying value of the investment at the date of disposal was negative at 6.7m, principally due to the receipt of the re-financing proceeds.
The equity disposal generated cash consideration of 5.1m after deducting disposal costs of 0.1m.
Net profit generated from the disposal was therefore 11.8m.
Pension arrangements Carillion operates a number of pension schemes in the United Kingdom for eligible employees.
The main defined benefit schemes are: The Carillion Staff Pension Scheme The Carillion B Pension Scheme The Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme relating to GTRM and Centrac The key actuarial assumptions used in the latest valuations of these schemes were: Staff B Public Sector GTRM Centrac Rate of increase in salaries 4.35% 5.35% 4.35% 4.75% 4.75% Rate of increase in pensions 2.35% 2.35% 2.35% 2.50% 2.50% Inflation rate 2.35% 2.35% 2.35% 2.50% 2.50% Discount rate 5.50% 5.50% 6.00% 5.61% 5.53% All the main defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom were fully funded on the prescribed Minimum Funding Requirement MFR basis.
67 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 30.
Pension arrangements continued Carillion Staff and B Pension Schemes Actuarial valuations of the above schemes were undertaken by the Trustees independent actuaries as at 31 December 2002 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the schemes assets at this date were 316.7m and 80.9m respectively, the value of which represented approximately 81% and 90% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 13.9m 2002: 1.1m in respect of the Carillion Staff Pension Scheme and 1.8m 2002: 0.1m in respect of the Carillion B Pension Scheme.
Both schemes are now closed to new entrants.
The increase in contributions during the year for the Staff and B schemes reflects the cessation of the employer contribution holiday in December 2002 and the agreed new contribution rates for the schemes with effect from July 2003 following the most recent valuations.
The contribution rates include an allowance for funding the past service deficits identified at the 2002 valuation date over the remaining average working life of the active scheme members.
The contribution rates will normally be reviewed at the next valuation due at 31 December 2005.
Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees independent actuaries as at 31 December 2002 using the attained age method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date was 58.2m, which represented approximately 90% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 2.2m 2002: 2.0m.
Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme Employees of GTRM and Centrac and former employees of British Rail transferred to these businesses have pension provision via Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme.
Both the GTRM and Centrac Sections are now closed to new entrants.
Shared cost arrangements are such that the employer and members share the cost of future service liabilities on a 60 40 split respectively and any surplus or deficit emerging over time is dealt with on a similar basis.
The contributions paid by the employer during the year were 4.9m 2002: 4.2m for GTRM and 0.1m 2002: 0.1m for Centrac.
Independent actuaries appointed by the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited carried out a formal valuation of the Railways Pension Scheme at 31 December 2001 using the projected unit method for GTRM and the attained age method for Centrac.
The next full valuation is due as at 31 December 2004.
The market value of the assets of the GTRM Section at the valuation date was 263.4m.
This represented 108% of the past service liabilities taking account of future increases in salaries.
The market value of the assets of the Centrac Section at the valuation date was 26.1m.
This represented 115% of the past service liabilities taking account of future increases in salaries.
Following the announcement by Network Rail that it intends to take in-house all rail maintenance contracts during 2004, there is expected to be a bulk transfer of members and the associated assets and liabilities to the Network Rail Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme.
As the employees involved and the financial basis have not been agreed with Network Rail, no assessment of the effect of any transfer can be made at the current time.
Other UK and overseas schemes The Group operates two UK defined contribution schemes, the Carillion Retirement Plan closed to new entrants and the Carillion Pension Plan.
The Carillion Pension Plan commenced on 1 April 2003.
The majority of new employees are eligible to join this plan.
Employees contribute a minimum of 5% and the employer a minimum of 7% of basic salaries.
Up to 3% of any additional voluntary contributions paid by employees is matched by the employer, resulting in a maximum employer contribution of 10% of basic salary.
Death in service lump sum benefits are provided in addition.
Employees of Carillion Services who are not eligible for other Carillion schemes are invited to participate in the Carillion Stakeholder Plus managed by Merrill Lynch Investment Management.
Employees contribute 5% and the employer 6.5% of basic salaries.
Stakeholder pensions are provided by B&CE Insurance and Scottish Widows where required by Working Rule Agreements.
The Carillion Group operates a defined benefit scheme for employees of Carillion Canada Inc managed locally and supplemental arrangements in respect of certain executives.
The Group also operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for employees of Carillion Rail Sverige AB again managed locally.
Contributions during the year were 1.1m 2002: 0.3m in respect of UK defined contribution schemes, Nil 2002: Nil in respect of the Canada defined benefit scheme and 0.2m 2002: 0.8m in respect of other post-retirement benefits for senior Canadian employees.
Contributions in respect of the Swedish and Norwegian defined benefit and defined contribution schemes during the period since acquisition were 0.6m.

Pension arrangements continued SSAP 24 pension costs Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs requires that the cost of providing pensions is recognised over the period benefiting from the employees services, with any differences between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the schemes being shown as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.
The pension cost has been determined by the Directors in conjunction with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the assumptions below: Staff B Public Sector GTRM Centrac Rate of increase in salaries 4.00% 5.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% Rate of increase in pensions 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% Inflation rate 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% Discount rate 6.25% 6.25% 6.25% 7.00% 7.00% The SSAP 24 position for the UK schemes is as follows: Public Railways Staff B Sector Pension Market value of assets m 316.7 80.9 58.2 289.5 Level of funding % 93.5 101.2 95.0 176.7 The charge to the profit and loss account as disclosed in Note 6 on page 49, is analysed as follows: Defined contribution Public Railways and overseas Staff B Sector Pension schemes Total m m m m m m Regular cost 10.0 1.5 2.5 6.1 1.9 22.0 Variation in cost 1.8 0.1 0.4 0.8 1.5 Interest credit 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.9 1.4 Net pension cost 11.5 1.5 2.8 4.4 1.9 22.1 Amounts carried in the balance sheet in respect of pension prepayments are disclosed in Note 17.
FRS 17 Retirement benefits Group Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24, under FRS 17 Retirement benefits the following transitional disclosures are required.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the FRS 17 position were: 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 UK Canada UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 4.06% 3.25% 3.58% 3.50% 3.75% 3.75% Rate of increase in pensions 2.81% 2.25% 2.33% 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% Inflation rate 2.81% 2.25% 2.33% 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% Discount rate 5.36% 6.00% 5.50% 6.25% 5.80% 5.80% The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
