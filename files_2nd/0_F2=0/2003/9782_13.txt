com 29 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is given below.
Accounting convention and basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. and all its subsidiaries for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2003.
The financial statements are drawn up on the historical cost basis of accounting, modied to include the valuation of certain United Kingdom properties at 31 March 1988 and the valuation of investment properties.
Compliance with SSAP 19, Accounting for Investment Properties requires a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to the depreciation of investment properties as explained below.
On 19 March 2002, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. following the implementation of a Scheme of Arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
This Scheme of Arrangement was accounted for using merger accounting principles, although it did not satisfy all of the conditions required by Schedule 4 of the Act.
In the opinion of the directors, the Scheme of Arrangement was a Group reconstruction rather than an acquisition since the shareholders in the Company were the same as the former shareholders of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. and the rights of each shareholder, relative to the others, were unchanged.
Therefore, the directors considered that to record the Scheme of Arrangement as an acquisition by the Company, attributing fair values to the assets and liabilities of the Group and reecting only the post Scheme of Arrangement results within the financial statements would fail to give a true and fair view of the Groups results and financial position.
Accordingly, having regard to the overriding requirement under Section 227 6 of the Companies Act 1985 for financial statements to give a true and fair view of the Groups results and financial position, the directors adopted merger accounting principles in drawing up the financial statements.
The directors consider that it is not practicable to quantify the effect of this departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements.
Turnover Turnover comprises sales of goods to customers outside the Group less returns, VAT and sales taxes, together with interest and other income attributable to the Financial Services operations.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pensions Funded pension plans are in place for the Groups UK employees and the majority of employees overseas.
The assets of these pension plans are managed by third-party investment managers and are held separately in trust.
Regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally qualied actuaries.
These determine the level of contributions required to fund the benets set out in the rules of the plans and allow for the periodic increase of pensions in payment.
The contributions and any variations from regular cost arising from the actuarial valuations are charged or credited to profits on a systematic basis over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees.
Goodwill Prior to 31 March 1998, goodwill arising on consolidation was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
As permitted by FRS 10, this goodwill has not been reinstated in the balance sheet and remains written off to reserves.
Goodwill arising on subsequent acquisitions is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.
The profit or loss arising on the sale of a previously acquired business includes the attributable goodwill.
Fixed assets a Capitalised interest Interest is not capitalised.
b Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation of tangible xed assets, less residual value, by equal annual instalments as follows: Land: not depreciated.
Freehold and leasehold buildings over 50 years: depreciated to their estimated residual value over their estimated remaining economic lives.
Leasehold land and buildings under 50 years: over the remaining period of the lease.
Fit out: 1025 years according to the estimated life of the asset.
Fixtures, ttings and equipment: 315 years according to the estimated life of the asset.
Depreciation is charged on all additions to or disposals of depreciating assets in the year of purchase or disposal.
Any impairment in value is charged to the profit and loss account.
30 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued c Land and buildings The Groups freehold and leasehold properties in the United Kingdom were valued on the basis of open market value for existing use in 1982.
At 31 March 1988, those same properties excluding subsequent additions and adjusted for disposals were revalued.
On adoption of FRS 15, the Group followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of land and buildings which were revalued in 1988, but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future.
These values are retained subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment in accordance with FRS 11. d Investment properties Investment properties are revalued annually and included in the balance sheet at their open market value.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
This represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements concerning the depreciation of xed assets.
These properties are held for investment and the directors consider that the adoption of this policy is necessary to give a true and fair view.
Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at market value.
All profits and losses from such investments are included in net interest income or in Financial Services turnover as appropriate.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method.
All stocks are nished goods.
Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances are classied as impaired when an instalment is in excess of 30 days overdue.
Specic provisions are made against all advances identied as impaired at the balance sheet date to the extent that, in the opinion of the directors, recovery is doubtful.
Specic provisions against such exposures are calculated using a bad debt provision model, which uses the last two years credit history to produce estimates of the likely level of asset impairment.
General provisions relate to latent bad and doubtful debts which are present in any lending portfolio but have not been specically identied.
General provisions are calculated using the same bad debt provision model and an evaluation of current economic and political factors.
Loans and advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery, based on a predetermined set of criteria.
Account balances written off include those where no payment has been received for a period of 12 months since the account was identied as doubtful, and in other situations such as bankruptcy, insolvency or fraud.
Long-term assurance business The value of the long-term assurance business consists of the present value of surpluses expected to emerge in the future from business currently in force, and this value is included in prepayments and accrued income.
In determining their value, these surpluses are discounted at a risk-adjusted, post-tax rate.
Changes in the value are included in the profit and loss account grossed up at the standard rate of corporation tax applicable to insurance companies.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures to uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative instruments utilised by the Group include interest rate and currency swaps, and forward currency contracts.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to net interest income over the period of the contract.
Forward currency contracts are accounted for as hedges, with the instruments impact on profit deferred until the underlying transaction is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currencies The results of international subsidiaries are translated at the weighted average of monthly exchange rates for sales and profits.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are dealt with through reserves and reported in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities held at the year-end are translated at year-end exchange rates or the exchange rate of a related forward exchange contract where appropriate.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for on an undiscounted basis at expected tax rates on all differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

C Post-retirement health benets The Group has a commitment to pay all or a proportion of the health insurance premiums for a number of its retired employees and their spouses, the last of whom retired in 1988.
There is no commitment in respect of current employees or those who have retired since 1988.
At 30 March 2002, the Group reassessed this liability in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
The resulting discounted present value of 25.3m was fully provided at 30 March 2002.
The valuation assumed a premium ination of 7.5% and an after-tax discount rate of 5.9%.
The current provision, which is included in the accounts on a SSAP 24 basis, is 25.0m see note 22.
There is a matching deferred taxation asset of 7.5m.
The provision has been estimated to be 24m on an FRS 17 basis last year 25m.
The next actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2005.
D United Kingdom Share Incentive Plan and Republic of Ireland profit Share Scheme The last payment under the 1997 UK profit Sharing Scheme was made in June 2002, in respect of the financial year ending 30 March 2002.
The Company has now adopted the free share element of the new all-employee Share Incentive Plan, which is approved by the Inland Revenue.
This is a discretionary plan and the Company will decide each year whether an award is to be made, depending upon the year-end profits.
The Republic of Ireland profit Sharing Scheme remains unchanged.
An award will be made in July 2003 in respect of the financial year ending 29 March 2003.
This has been xed at 8.8m last year 12.6m, representing 2.0% last year 2.5% of the earnings of 53,418 last year 44,197 eligible employees with a maximum award of approximately 220.
These shares are purchased in the market: 2,846,100 ordinary shares were purchased by the profit Sharing Trustees in respect of the 2001 2002 allocation.
E United Kingdom Employees Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the Scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the date of offer.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three, five or seven years after entering the Scheme.

Pension costs A SSAP 24 disclosure The total pension cost for the Group was 144.8m last year 147.9m of which 135.7m last year 138.5m relates to the UK dened benefit pension scheme.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK dened benefit pension scheme was carried out at 1 April 2001 by an independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The key assumptions adopted were: % Ination rate 2.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 Discount rate and rate of return on investments 6.0 This actuarial valuation revealed a shortfall of 134m in the market value of the assets of the UK Scheme of 3,102m compared to the actuarial liability for pension benets.
This represents a funding level of 96%.
The shortfall of 134m together with the unamortised accounting deficit relating to prior periods gives a total unamortised deficit of 177m.
This is being amortised in accordance with SSAP 24 over a period of 12 years from 1 April 2001, being the remaining estimated service lives of the current Scheme members.
The total UK pension cost under the dened benefit pension scheme is analysed as follows: 2003 2002 m m 1 Normal pension cost 114.9 116.1 Amortisation of deficit 14.8 14.8 Net interest elements 6.0 7.6 Total 135.7 138.5 1 At standard contribution rate of 19.7% last year 19.7%.
As shown in note 15, the Group has prepaid pension costs of 161.0m in relation to the UK scheme.
This includes the partial funding of the deficit, offset by the amortisation and interest elements shown above, with the balance being prepaid contributions to the UK scheme.

Pension costs continued B FRS 17 disclosure Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 Retirement benets was issued in November 2000 to replace SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs and will be fully mandatory for the Group for the year ending 31 March 2006.
This year the Group has continued to account for pension costs under SSAP 24 as shown on page 37, although in accordance with the FRS 17 transitional arrangements, certain additional disclosures are required as shown below.
a The major assumptions used by the independent qualied actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of the UK and Republic of Ireland dened benefit pension schemes to 29 March 2003 for FRS 17 purposes were: 2003 2002 % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.5 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5 2.5 Discount rate 5.5 5.9 Ination rate 2.5 2.5 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.5 7.5 b On full compliance with FRS 17, on the basis of the above assumptions, the amounts that would have been charged to the consolidated profit and loss account and consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses for the year ended 29 March 2003 are set out below: 2003 m Operating profit Current service costs 124 Finance income Expected return on scheme assets 231 Interest on scheme liabilities 204 Net credit to finance income 27 Total charge 97 Consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 713 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 16 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 196 Actuarial loss recognisable in consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses 893 c The assets in the UK and Republic of Ireland dened benefit pension schemes and the expected long-term rates of return as at 29 March 2003 were: Expected long-term rate of return p. a.
