Regulatory Accounting Information 2003 Contents Historical Cost Information Profit and Loss Account 34 Balance Sheet 35 Current Cost Information Profit and Loss Account 36 Balance Sheet 37 Cash Flow Statement 38 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information 39 Auditors Report 56 Explanatory note Pages 34 to 56 include the regulatory accounting information which the company is required to publish under the company's Instrument of Appointment as a water and sewerage undertaker.
The information has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulatory Accounting Guidelines issued by the Director General of Water Services.
These common services costs were recharged to an associate company as turnover then subsequently charged back as part of a contract.
This is not consistent with the statutory accounts presentation.
The accounting policies set out on pages 13 to 16 apply to the historical cost regulatory accounting information, with the exception of the accounting for infrastructure assets explained in Note 15 on page 54 and the investment in the York Waterworks Ltd explained in Note 1 on page 40.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CURRENT COST INFORMATION The current cost information has been prepared for the Appointed Business of Yorkshire Water Services Ltd in accordance with guidance issued by the Director General of Water Services for modified real terms financial statements suitable for regulation in the water industry.
Profitability is measured on the basis of real financial capital maintenance in the context of assets which are valued at their modern equivalent asset value to the business.
The accounting policies used are the same as those adopted in the statutory historical cost accounts, except as set out below.
Infrastructure assets As noted on page 34, FRS 12 has not been implemented in the regulatory accounts and the difference between planned and actual expenditure on infrastructure renewals is shown as a provision within working capital in the current cost balance sheet.
Tangible fixed assets Assets in operational use are valued at the replacement cost of their operating capability.
To the extent that the regulatory regime does not allow such assets to earn a return high enough to justify that value, this represents a modification of the value to the business principle.
Also, no provision is made for the possible funding of future replacements of assets by contributions from third parties and, to the extent that some of those assets would on replacement be so funded, replacement cost again differs from value to the business.
Redundant assets are valued at their recoverable amount.
The modern equivalent asset values arising from the last Periodic Review are incorporated in the 2002 03 Regulatory Accounting Information.
- Land and buildings Non-specialised operational properties are valued on the basis of open market value for existing use and have been expressed in real terms by indexing using the Retail Price Index RPI.
Specialised operational properties are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and recoverable amount, restated annually between periodic Asset Management Plan AMP reviews by adjusting for inflation as measured by changes in the RPI.
The unamortised portion of third party contributions received is deducted in arriving at net operating assets as described below.
- Infrastructure assets Mains, sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls are valued at replacement cost, determined principally on the basis of data provided by the AMP.
Values now reflect the AMP carried out at the last Periodic Review.
A process of continuing refinement of asset records is expected to produce adjustments to existing values when periodic reviews of the AMP take place.
In the intervening years, values are restated to take account of changes in the general level of inflation, as measured by changes in the RPI over the year.
39 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information - Other fixed assets All other fixed assets are valued periodically at depreciated replacement cost.
Between periodic AMP reviews, values are restated for inflation as measured by changes in the RPI.
- Surplus land Surplus land is valued at recoverable amount, taking into account that part of any proceeds to be passed on to customers under Condition B of the Licence.
Grants and other third party contributions Grants, infrastructure charges and other third party contributions received since 31 March 1990 are carried forward to the extent that any balance has not been credited to revenue.
The balance carried forward is restated for the change in the RPI for the year and treated as for deferred income.
Real financial capital maintenance adjustments These adjustments are made to historical cost profit in order to arrive at profit after the maintenance of financial capital in real terms: - Working capital adjustment This is calculated by applying the change in the RPI over the year to the opening total of trade debtors and stock less trade creditors and the provision for liabilities and charges.
- Financing adjustment This is calculated by applying the change in the RPI over the year to the opening balance of net finance, which comprises all monetary assets and liabilities in the balance sheet apart from those included in working capital.
Investment in York Waterworks The intangible assets and investments accounting policy on page 14 of the accounts outlines the treatment of the transfer of the trade and net assets of the York Waterworks Ltd to Yorkshire Water.
In the regulatory accounts, the investment figure and compensating intercompany creditor of 16.6m have been netted to provide suitable comparisons with the previous year and consistency with the approach agreed with OFWAT.
RING FENCING In the opinion of the Directors, the company was in compliance with paragraph 3.1 of Condition K of the Instrument of Appointment at the end of the financial year.
This relates to the availability of rights and assets in the event of a special administration order.
40 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information 3.
APPOINTED AND NON-APPOINTED BUSINESS The historical cost accounting information shows separate figures for Appointed and Nonappointed Business.
The Appointed Business is defined to be the regulated activities of the Appointee, i. e. those necessary to fulfil the functions and duties of a water and sewerage undertaker.
The Nonappointed Business encompasses those activities for which Yorkshire Water Services is not a monopoly supplier or the activity involves the optional use of an asset owned by the Appointed Business.
DIRECTORS CERTIFICATE CONDITION F The Directors declare that the company will have available, for at least the next 12 months, sufficient financial resources and facilities to enable it to carry out its regulated activities and sufficient management resources to enable it to carry out its functions.
This assessment is based on the net worth of the company as shown in the accounts and on its Business Plan for the forthcoming year.
The Directors also declare that all contracts entered into with Associated Companies, and any arrangements made with any relevant authority for the discharge of any of the Appointee's sewerage functions, include all necessary provisions and requirements concerning the standard of service to be supplied to ensure that the company is able to meet all its obligations as a water and sewerage undertaker, as required in Section 6A.
2A 3 of Condition F. This opinion has been formed following examination of the documents in question.
DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSOCIATES Allocation of costs All direct costs are allocated immediately to the activity to which they relate.
Indirect costs and overheads are apportioned on an appropriate basis to reflect the incidence of such costs.
Indirect costs include administrative expenses and the provision of common services.
Direct costs attributable to the provision of services other than the Appointed Business are separately allocated and identified as 'Non-Appointed'.
Indirect costs, relating to nonappointed activities, are recovered as a fixed percentage of direct costs based upon the analysis of operating costs.
Borrowings or sums lent During the year, surplus funds were invested with the parent company at 3 month LIBOR rates.
At 31 March 2003, the sum invested was 317m.
On 31 March 2000, 200m was lent by the parent company, at a fixed rate of 6.875%, repayable in 2010, on 17 April 2000 150m was lent at a fixed rate of 6.625% repayable in 2031, and on November 2001 a further 90m was lent at a fixed rate of 6.625% repayable in 2031.
On 21 February 2003, 197.1m was lent by Yorkshire Water Services Finance Plc, a subsidiary of the company, at a fixed rate of 5.375%, repayable in 2023 and 99.4m, at a floating rate, repayable in 2033.
No other material sums were lent to or borrowed from other associated companies.
41 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information Dividends paid to associated undertakings Amounts paid to the parent company, Kelda Group plc, and the underlying dividend policy are disclosed in the Directors Report on page 6 of these accounts.
Guarantees securities The bankers for Kelda Group current accounts provide an arrangement whereby debit and credit balances are pooled with interest charged on the net group balance.
This facility is subject to provision of cross guarantees by each company within the pooling arrangement, guaranteeing each of the other companies current account liabilities with the bank.
This is provided the net amount of aggregate cleared debit less credit balances must not exceed 20m nor must the aggregate cleared debit balances exceed 25m.
Transfer of Assets and Liabilities During the course of the year land and buildings were sold to group companies at market value.
Supply of Service Details of services supplied to the Appointee by associates during the year are disclosed below where these exceed a materiality level of 1m in line with RAG 5.03 requirements.
No services of a material value were provided by the Appointee to associates.
Turnover of Service Associate Company Associate Terms of Supply Value m m Corporate charges Kelda Group plc 5.0 Cost allocation 3.1 Customer Services Loop Customer Management 17.3 Cost allocation 15.4 The Directors declare that, to the best of their knowledge, all appropriate transactions with associated companies have been disclosed.

Total turnover for the year increased by 1.3% to 567.8m in 2002 03 2002: 560.4m, compared with the 1.2% overall increase in charges from 1 April 2002, and additional income was generated from new domestic and commercial customers.
These have been offset by the loss of income from the continuing impact of customers switching to domestic meter options and the decline in measured and trade effluent consumption, a trend which has affected income over the full five year period.
The impact of the tariff reduction of 13.1% in 2001 can be seen in the 2001 turnover numbers.
Operating costs adjusted for inflation have decreased steadily over the five year period due to continuing cost reductions and efficiency improvement despite increasing depreciation figures and operating costs arising from the large capital programme.
Net interest payable has increased each year reflecting the company's increasing net debt level.
52 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information There has been a significant increase in the tax charge for 2003.
The current year tax charge has increased by 12.9m to 11.3m, due to a tax credit in 2002 in respect of previous years.
The deferred tax charge has increased by 17.9m to 33.5m reflecting a fall in the interest rate used for discounting purposes.
This has been included in the accounts to comply with FRS 19 and its calculation is described in Note 8 of the statutory accounts on page 22.
Comparative figures prior to 2001 have not been calculated as this is not a requirement for statutory accounts.
Details of the dividend paid in the year and the underlying dividend policy are disclosed in the Directors' Report on page 6 of the statutory accounts.
The 2001 figure included an efficiency dividend of 98m.
53 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information The value of tangible fixed assets and related third party contributions have increased significantly over the five year period reflecting the substantial capital investment programme.
The operating review on page 1 of the statutory accounts describes the 2002 03 programme in detail.
The increase in cash and investments occurring in 2000 reflects the purchase of the York Waterworks Ltd which took place on 1 April 2000.
Working capital has increased significantly between 2002 and 2003 due to an increase of 243.0m in loans to the parent company.
This is offset however by increases in net debt included within creditors due over one year.
Fluctuations in the level of capital creditors have also affected working capital, particularly in 2000 and 2002, when figures were high.
The level of the infrastructure renewals provision has also decreased from 66.6m in 1999 to 5.0m in 2003.
The increase in creditors due over one year reflects the increase in net debt over the five year period.
Fluctuations in non-trade creditors due within one year are also mainly attributable to short term borrowings.
A deferred tax provision has been included in the accounts to comply with FRS 19 and its calculation is described in Note 18 of the statutory accounts on pages 27 and 28.
Deferred tax charges have been included for the current and previous years to comply with FRS 19.
Prior years' figures have not been calculated, as this is not a requirement for statutory accounts.
"RECONCILIATION OF BALANCE SHEETS IN STATUTORY AND REGULATORY ACCOUNTS In the preparation of its statutory accounts, the company has followed common industry practice and adopted the infrastructure renewals accounting basis as set out in FRS 15 ""Tangible Fixed Assets""."
However, for the purposes of Regulatory Accounts, OFWAT has requested that FRS 15 is not applied for infrastructure renewals accounting, thereby providing a basis consistent with prior years.
