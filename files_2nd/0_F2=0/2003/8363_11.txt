Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2003 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
The Group was created by a group reconstruction whereby, on 24 May 2002, the shareholders in Intertek Testing Services Holdings Limited ITSHL, formerly Intertek Testing Services Limited, exchanged the whole of their shareholdings in ITSHL in return for shares in a newly formed holding company, Intertek Testing Services plc.
The acquisition of ITSHL by Intertek Testing Services plc was accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger accounting as set out in FRS 6: Acquisitions and Mergers and Schedule 4A to the Companies Act 1985.
By adopting this accounting treatment the consolidated financial information included in these accounts has been shown as though the parent company had always been the parent company of the Group.
Parent company Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the Groups share of net assets and results of associates, made up to 31 December 2003.
New subsidiaries are included from their respective dates of acquisition during the period except where they have been merger accounted.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of during the period are included up to the date of disposal.
An associate interest is one in which the Group has a long term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting rights, and over which it actually exercises significant influence.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account on the equity accounting basis and the holding value of associates in the Group balance sheet is calculated by reference to the Groups equity in the net assets of such undertakings.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities of group companies which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings and associated undertakings are translated at the closing exchange rates.
Profit and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to reserves, net of exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation, which is provided, except for freehold land, on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets down to their expected residual value, mainly at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings 2% Short leasehold land and buildings term of lease Plant and machinery 10% to 33.3% 29 Intertek Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 www.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Leases Assets held under finance leases are treated as if they had been purchased at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
This cost is included in tangible fixed assets and depreciation is provided over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life.
The corresponding obligations under these leases are included within borrowings.
The finance charge element of rentals payable is charged to the profit and loss account to produce a constant rate of interest.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing stocks and work in progress to their present condition and location.
Turnover Turnover represents the total amount receivable for services provided and goods sold, excluding sales related taxes and intra group transactions.
Turnover is recognised when the relevant service is completed or goods delivered.
Deferred tax Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax assets in respect of timing differences are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits to offset the future reversal of these timing differences.
Pension benefits Contributions payable under defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
The Group has a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
Following the implementation in 2001 of FRS 17: Retirement Benefits, the defined benefit schemes assets are valued at market value and the schemes liabilities are discounted to present values using high quality corporate bond rates.
The resultant pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits, are recognised in full on the face of the balance sheet, net of deferred taxation.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to profits.
The expected return on the schemes assets less the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities during the accounting period is shown as Other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses, net of deferred tax, are recognised in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration payable and the fair value of separable net assets acquired, in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998, is capitalised in accordance with the requirements of FRS 10: Goodwill and Intangible Assets, and is amortised on a straight line basis over the Directors estimate of useful life, which is up to 20 years.
Purchased goodwill in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition, in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account.
In respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Impairment of goodwill is recorded when it becomes clear that the carrying value of goodwill in relation to a specific business may not be recoverable.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions and these may be made on provisional estimates.
Amendments may be made to these adjustments in the subsequent accounting period with corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the light of post acquisition experience.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Financial instruments These instruments are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts.
Interest differentials on derivative instruments and amounts receivable and payable on interest rate instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction.
Gains and losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Capitalisation of debt issuance costs Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with term borrowings are deferred and amortised over the life of the debt.
Borrowings are presented net of unamortised debt issuance costs.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Group comprises four operating divisions which are organised as follows: Labtest, which tests and inspects textiles, toys and other consumer products: Caleb Brett, which tests and inspects oil, chemicals and agricultural produce: ETL SEMKO, which tests and certifies electrical and electronic products, telecommunication equipment, building products and heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment and Foreign Trade Standards, which provides standards programmes and pre shipment inspection programmes to standards bodies and governments.

Description of borrowings In May 2002, the Group entered into a 300m Secured Facilities Agreement comprising a 250m multi-currency Facility A and a 50m multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility B.
The Facility A amortises over five years with the final repayment on 15 June 2007.
Any drawings under Facility B commitment have to be repaid on 15 June 2007.
Borrowings under the Secured Facilities Agreement are secured substantially over all the assets of the Group.
Advances under Facility A initially bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR as adjusted plus 1.5%.
The margin over LIBOR may be reduced to 1.25%, 1% and then to 0.75% in accordance with a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio test.
There have been no drawings under Facility B.
As at 31 December 2003, the margin was 0.75%.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities, which mature in June 2007, amounted to 50.0m 2002: 50.0m of which 4.2m 2002: 4.9m has been utilised for letters of credit and guarantees.

PENSION SCHEMES The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, United States, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
These are all funded plans, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Other defined benefit plans in certain countries are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution plans.
The schemes in Hong Kong and in the United Kingdom were closed to new entrants with effect from 1 December 2001 and 1 April 2002, respectively.
a The total pension cost for the Group was: 2003 2002 m m Defined contribution schemes 6.2 5.6 Defined benefit schemes - current service cost 2.1 2.5 8.3 8.1 The pension cost for the defined contribution plans is the contributions payable by the Group during the year.
At 31 December 2003, there were outstanding contributions of 2.5m 2002: 2.3m.
There were no past service costs during the year in respect of the defined benefit plans.
For closed schemes, under the projected unit method as required by FRS 17, the current service cost as a percentage of relevant defined benefit pensionable payroll will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
b The pension cost for the defined benefit plans was assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The last full triennial actuarial valuation of the UK pension scheme was carried out on 31 March 2001.
The discount rate applied for that plan was 6.0%.
The Hong Kong and Taiwan plans provide for a lump sum upon retirement based on a multiple of final salary.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Details of the Groups Treasury controls are set out in the Operating and financial review on page 12. a Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Whilst these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged.
The Group is not a party to any leverage derivatives and does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The notional amount of derivatives summarised in this note does not represent amounts exchanged by parties and, thus, is not a measure of the exposure of the Group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional amount and the other terms of the derivatives, which relate to interest rates or exchange rates.
Counterparties to financial instruments expose the Group to credit related losses in the event of non-performance, but the Group does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings.
The Group does not demand collateral when entering into derivative financial instruments.
The credit exposure of interest rate and foreign currency contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the end of each period.
The following numerical disclosures relate to the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in FRS 13: Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
For all the numerical disclosures, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13.
50 Intertek Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 29.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED b Foreign exchange risk management A substantial portion of the Groups turnover is derived from customers located outside the United Kingdom.
In addition, the net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Companys shareholders funds.
The Groups administrative operations are conducted in several countries outside of the United Kingdom and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups income is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies, and translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
Some of the contracts involve the exchange of two foreign currencies, according to local needs in foreign subsidiaries.
The term of the currency derivatives do not exceed one year.
The table below summarises by major currency the contractual amounts of the Groups forward exchange contracts in sterling.
The buy amounts represent the sterling equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currency, and the sell amounts represent the sterling equivalent of commitment to sell foreign currencies.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED d Currency exposure of the Groups net monetary assets liabilities These exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating units involved.
In view of the hedges taken out by the Group, the currency exposure ie those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account, of the Groups net monetary assets liabilities are not material.
e Interest rate risk management The Group has a significant amount of borrowings bearing interest at variable rates.
To reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Group enters into interest rate swap agreements.
The interest rate swap agreements convert certain long term borrowing at floating rates based on inter-bank borrowing rates in various countries to fixed rates, that are lower than those available to the Group if the fixed rate borrowing were made directly.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2003, is set out below: At fixed At floating Total interest interest Interest carrying rates rates free value Financial assets m m m m Short term deposits and cash: Sterling 44.4 44.4 US dollar 12.3 3.0 15.3 Chinese renminbi 7.7 7.7 Hong Kong dollar 4.3 4.3 Euros 0.3 4.2 4.5 Other currencies 3.8 1.5 5.3 72.8 8.7 81.5 Investments and debtors due after one year: Sterling 0.1 0.1 US dollar 1.6 1.6 Other currencies 1.2 1.2 2.9 2.9 Total financial assets 72.8 11.6 84.4 Short term deposits are overnight deposits bearing interest at rates fixed daily in advance.
The fair value of total financial assets approximates its carrying value.
Financial liabilities The fair values, maturity, interest rate and exchange rate profiles of borrowings is shown in the table under the exchange rate sensitivity section below.
The maturity profile of other financial liabilities of 1.4m is shown in note 17.
This liability is mainly US dollar denominated and is non interest bearing.
The fair value approximates its carrying value of 1.4m.
52 Intertek Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 29.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED f Fair value of financial instruments The Groups on-balance sheet financial instruments, with the exception of borrowings, are generally short term in nature.
Accordingly, the fair value of such instruments approximates their carrying value.
The fair value of variable rate borrowings approximates their carrying value because such loans re-price at market rate periodically.
The fair value and carrying value of long term borrowings, including the current portion, was 216.5m 2002: 241.3m and 216.5m 2002: 241.3m respectively.
The fair value of off-balance sheet financial instruments are as follows: 2003 2002 m m Forward exchange contracts 0.1 Interest rate swaps 1.4 1.8 g Exchange rate sensitivity The table below provides information about the maturity and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings.

Accordingly, the counterparty risk is reduced from the nominal to the fair value of the derivatives.
Therefore, the Groups counterparty exposure under foreign exchange contracts was nil 2002: nil and interest rate swaps was nil 2002: nil.
i Unrecognised gains and losses There were no material unrecognised gains or losses arising from the use of financial assets and financial liabilities as hedges.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 2003 2002 Group m m Performance bonds 2.5 2.3 Other guarantees 1.2 1.2 3.7 3.5 From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of business, including claims for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes with former employees.
The Group is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
On the basis of currently available information, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome, arising from any such ordinary litigation is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The Group holds a professional indemnity insurance policy that provides coverage for certain claims from customers.
The Directors consider this policy adequate for normal commercial purposes.
From time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company may give guarantees in respect of certain liabilities of subsidiary companies.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS W Hauser, a Non-Executive Director of the Company, has a consultancy agreement to assist the Group in its expansion within Europe for which he received a fee of 1,000 per working day plus an annual bonus of up to 25% of the consultancy fees payable on the satisfactory completion of the tasks assigned to him.
In 2003, the amount paid under this consultancy agreement including bonus, was 77,000 2002: 16,000.
Apart from the above, neither the Company nor the Group has entered into any material transactions with related parties during the year as defined by FRS 8: Related Party Disclosures.
