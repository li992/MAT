3Prior Year Adjustment In the period the group has adopted FRS 17.
In prior periods the group had accounted for pension costs under SSAP 24.
The resulting restatement to group profit and loss account reserve is as follows: Group profit and loss account reserve m m At 31 December 2002 as previously stated 254.5 On removing SSAP 24 prepayment at 1 January 2002 14.6 On creating FRS17 liability at 1 January 2002 4.7 Adjustment to profit retained in the year 0.3 Actuarial loss in the year net of tax 42.8 Net effect of restatement 61.8 At 31 December 2002 as restated 192.7 This change in accounting policy has resulted in an increase in staff costs of 1.6m 2002 - 2.1m and other finance charges income of 0.9 m 2002 - 2.6m, an decrease increase in the tax charge of 0.7m 2002 - 0.2 m, a decrease in profit for the year by 1.8m 2002 - increase of 0.3m and a decrease in total recognised gains and losses of 8.2m 2002 - 43.5m.
Other debtors at December 2002 have been reduced by 21.7m, together with related deferred tax of 6.5m.
If stated on a SSAP 24 basis, profit on ordinary activities before taxation would have been 2.5m greater 2002 - 0.5m less at 57.0m 2002 - 99.4m giving a basic earnings per share of 18.8p 2002 - 70.4p and an underlying earnings per share of 95.2p 2002 - 86.2p.
58 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 4Integration Costs Connected with the acquisition of the Thales Antennas business of Thales in July 2003, costs of 0.8m have been incurred in respect of restructuring the business.
Following the acquisition of the Power and Control business of BAE Systems at the end of 2002, costs of 3.2m were incurred in that year in respect of the integration of the business with various parts of Aerospace Systems.
5 Disposal of Group Undertakings In line with the groups strategy to focus on its core aerospace and defence markets, Westwind Air Bearings Limited and Westwind Air Bearings Inc. together Westwind, were sold on 10 December 2003 for total proceeds of 21.2m.
This gave rise to a profit on disposal of tangible assets of 4.3m which became an exceptional loss of 64.1m after the reversal of 68.4m of goodwill originally written-off to reserves.
There was no tax payable or recoverable in relation to this disposal.
This business has been treated as a discontinued operation in the financial statements.

This adjusted tax charge is lower than the prevailing rates principally because part of the goodwill charge is an allowable expense for tax purposes and some group expenditure on research and development qualifies for additional tax deduction.
COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 59 7Tax on Profit on Ordinary Activities continued The tax assessed for the year is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2002 - 30%.

The group expects that this will remain broadly unchanged in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value.
Also, no deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme.
In the USA, both the Carleton Technologies and Stanley Aviation defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members from 31 December 2003 and 31 January 2004 respectively.
Since the majority of the defined benefit schemes operated by the group are closed to new entrants, the age profile of the schemes in service membership will increase over time.
Under the funding method prescribed by FRS 17, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.
In the year, the group assumed the defined benefit schemes of Drger Aerospace in Germany and ERA Technology in the UK.
Both of these schemes have been included in the assessment of the FRS 17 liability and in the tables below.
FRS 17 assumptions The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.
A full valuation of the CPP scheme was undertaken as at 1 April 2001 and updated to 31 December 2003 by a qualified independent actuary.
During the period, employer contributions for the period were raised to 17.3%.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries of the group schemes as at 31 December 2003 in respect of FRS 17 were as follows: UK Schemes USA Schemes At At At At At At 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salary costs 3.50% 3.25% 4.00% 4.00%-5.00% 4.00% 4.00% Discount rate 5.50% 5.60% 6.00% 6.00%-6.25% 7.00% 7.00% Inflation assumption 2.75% 2.25% 2.50% 2.50%-3.00% 2.50% 2.50% Pensions increase 2.75% 2.25% 2.50% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% For the Drger Aerospace scheme in Germany the following assumptions were used for 2003: rate of increase in salaries 4.00%, discount rate 5.50%, inflation 1.00% and rate of pensions increase 1.5%.
The assets of the various schemes are held in managed and segregated funds held with various companies.

LCL was incorporated to undertake the private placing.
Prior to the private placing Cobham plc owned 89% of the share capital of LCL.
The placing was made to a number of institutional investors.
The market price on 9 July 2003 was 11.92.
In accordance with the provisions of merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, the company recorded the cost of investment in LCL at the nominal value of the shares issued.
On consolidation, the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of the shares issued has been recorded as a merger reserve.
Also in 2003 the preference shares in LCL have been redeemed and 104.0m has been transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
LCL is now in dissolution.
In addition to the placing, during the year 163,407 ordinary shares were issued in connection with the executive share option schemes, 18,303 were issued in connection with the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme and 138,836 were issued in connection with the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.

The numerical disclosures are set out in notes 31 to 34.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments not to provide numerical disclosures in relation to short term debtors and creditors, other than currency risk disclosures.
Financial instruments The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and to raise finance for the groups operations.
The groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risks arising from the groups operations and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk The group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other EU countries, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia.
As a result, the groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Where significant, currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the parent company.
The pound US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as Cobham is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which the subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
The most significant of these instruments is a foreign exchange contract, which was entered into in 1997, whereby the group has agreed to exchange dollars for sterling at a rate of 1: US$1.6263 over the period to 2012 with US$82m of this commitment being outstanding at 31 December 2003.
Approximately US$13m of the commitment applies to 2004, US$53m from 2005 to 2008 with the balance of US$16m over the remaining four years.
It is the groups current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The group also has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the units functional currency.
The groups policy is to minimise trading in subsidiaries non operating currencies.
However, where this is impractical the group will seek to reduce its exposure through the use of forward contracts.
The group does not hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
Generally, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
Interest rate risk The group has various long and short term borrowings, principally in sterling and US dollars, at fixed and floating rates of interest.
The group is continually monitoring its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions, including instances where interest rate swaps are used.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit.
These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates.
Liquidity risk The group has a strong cash flow and where practicable the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a regional basis.
For short term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall group arrangement.
In the USA a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the groups policy has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with their lenders.
The private placement of Cobham guaranteed senior notes which raised US$225m in October 2002 enabled the group to reduce short term and increase long term borrowings.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Details of the year end position, which is in accordance with this policy, are given in note 33.
It is, in addition, the groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management of the groups liquidity: details are also given in note 33.
76 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Foreign Currency Risk The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group companies and the group.

Hedges of foreign currency transactions As described above, it is the groups policy to partially hedge foreign currency denominated net assets by currency borrowings.
As these are not formally matched, the group recognises all gains and losses on these in the period in which they are incurred.

In addition provisions for liabilities and charges of 23.3m 2002 - 23.3m and long term creditors of 5.7m 2002 - 8.4m have been excluded as they do not meet the definition of a financial liability under FRS 13.
In order to reflect the associated interest rate swap, the US dollar senior notes issued in 2002 have been classified as floating rate financial liabilities.
The 2002 comparatives have been restated to reflect this classification.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
For floating rate loans, fair values closely approximate to cost.
