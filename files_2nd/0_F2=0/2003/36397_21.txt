Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies Accounting Convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of tangible fixed assets and investments in subsidiary undertakings, and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The true and fair override provisions of the Companies Act 1985 have been invoked, as explained in Depreciation below.
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, the Group has changed its accounting policy to capitalise interest attributable to properties in the course of development including major refurbishments.
Previously such interest was written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
This new accounting policy has been adopted because, as the Groups development programme gathers momentum, the inclusion of interest in development costs will give a more appropriate view of the results for the period and of the expenditure on developments and the surpluses created by development activity.
The effect of this change in accounting policy is not material to this years results, nor does it give rise to a prior year adjustment.
Basis of Consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 March.
Rent Receivable This comprises rental income on investment and trading properties for the year, exclusive of service charges receivable.
Service charges are credited against relevant expenditure.
Property and Refurbishment Costs Irrecoverable running costs directly attributable to specic properties within the Groups portfolio are charged to the profit and loss account as property expenses.
Costs incurred in the improvement of the portfolio which, in the opinion of the directors, are not of a capital nature are written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Administration Expenses Costs not directly attributable to individual properties are treated as administration expenses.
Properties Trading properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Investment properties, including those in the course of development, are professionally valued each year, on an open market basis, and any surpluses or deficits arising are taken to revaluation reserve.
Disposals of investment and trading properties are recognised where contracts have been exchanged during the accounting period and completion has taken place before or shortly after the year end.
Depreciation In accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
19, no depreciation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years to run.
Although the Companies Act 1985 would normally require the systematic annual depreciation of xed assets, the directors believe that this policy of not providing depreciation is necessary in order for the accounts to give a true and fair view, since the current value of investment properties, and changes in that current value, are of prime importance rather than a calculation of systematic annual depreciation.
Depreciation is only one of the many factors reected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identied or quantied.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of tangible fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Subsidiary Undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are valued at amounts equal to their original cost and any subsequent movement in the capital reserves of those subsidiaries, thus reecting in the Companys balance sheet the surplus arising from the revaluation and the sale of investments and investment properties of those subsidiaries.
Pensions The Group contributes to a dened benefit pension plan which is funded with assets held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The regular cost is attributed to individual years using the projected unit method.
Variations in pension cost, which are identied as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees in proportion to their expected payroll costs.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
56 Annual Report 2003 Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements Capitalisation of Interest Interest associated with direct expenditure on properties under development including major refurbishments is capitalised.
Direct expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site or property if it was acquired specifically for development, but does not include the acquisition cost or valuation of properties held as investments.
Interest is capitalised from the start of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The rate used is the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of borrowings or, if appropriate, the rate on specific associated borrowings.
Financial Instruments An interest rate swap is accounted for as a hedge when it alters the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure, typically a floating rate bank loan.

9 Profit Attributable to Members of the Parent Undertaking As permitted by Section 230 1 b Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 93.3 million 2002: 24.1 million.
11 Earnings per Share Earnings per share are based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 20.5 million 2002: profit of 4.5 million and on the weighted average of 203,092,527 shares in issue 2002: 207,994,455 shares.
There is no impact on earnings per share of conversion of the convertible bonds, or share options.
The directors believe that earnings per share before deferred tax arising on capital allowances exceeding depreciation, exceptional items and profits or losses on sales of investment properties provide a more meaningful measure of the Groups performance.
Accordingly, earnings per share on that adjusted basis have been disclosed on the face of the profit and loss account and calculated as follows: 2003 2003 2002 2002 Loss Profit Earnings Profit Earnings After Tax per Share After Tax Per Share m Pence m Pence Basic 20.5 10.1 4.5 2.1 Deferred tax 4.7 2.3 2.8 1.3 Exceptional items 49.8 24.5 21.5 10.3 Loss on sale of investment properties 2.4 1.2 3.2 1.6 Adjusted 27.0 13.3 26.4 12.7 Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements Annual Report 2003 59 Leasehold Leasehold Freehold over 900 Years 50-250 Years Total 12 Investment Properties m m m m Book value at 1 April 2002 813.9 114.8 147.4 1,076.1 Add: Included in prepayments and accrued income Market value at 1 April 2002 813.9 114.8 147.4 1,076.1 Additions at cost 10.7 0.2 10.9 Disposals 212.5 0.2 2.9 215.6 612.1 114.8 144.5 871.4 Deficit on revaluation 77.1 10.3 4.0 91.4 Market value at 31 March 2003 535.0 104.5 140.5 780.0 Less: Included in prepayments and accrued income 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.6 Book value at 31 March 2003 534.7 104.3 140.4 779.4 m Movement in revaluation reserve: Deficit on revaluation 91.4 Add: Included within prepayments and accrued income at 1 April 2002 Less: Included within prepayments and accrued income at 31 March 2003 0.6 Movement in revaluation reserve note 23 92.0 The freehold and leasehold investment properties were valued on the basis of Open Market Value by CB Hillier Parker as at 31 March 2003 in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

Market values have been used to determine the fair value of listed long-term borrowings, and interest rate swaps have been valued by reference to market rates of interest.
The fair values of all other items have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The cumulative aggregate losses on financial instruments for which hedge accounting has been used that are unrecognised at the balance sheet date are 1.5 million 2002: losses of 2.5 million.
Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments are not recognised in the accounts until the hedged position matures.

30 Pension Commitments The Group contributes to a dened benefit pension plan, the assets of which are held by trustees separately from the assets of the Company.
The contributions relating to the Plan are determined with the advice of an independent qualied actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the Attained Age funding method.
The most recent valuation of the Plan was conducted as at 1 April 2002, using the following main assumptions: rate of salary increases 5 per cent.
per annum: rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.75 per cent.
per annum: rate of increase in pensions in payment, subject to indexation at the lower of RPI and 5 per cent.
per annum: discount rate pre-retirement 7 per cent.
per annum: discount rate post-retirement 5.5 per cent.
per annum: inflation 2.75 per cent.
per annum: and asset valuation market value.
The valuation showed that the market value of the Plans assets at 1 April 2002 amounted to 9.1 million and the actuarial value of the accumulated fund was sufficient to cover 90 per cent.
of the benefits which had accrued to the members of the Plan at that date, allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following the valuation, the Groups contributions have been paid at a rate of 5.5 per cent.
of pensionable salaries plus pensions in payment in aggregate equating to 28.6 per cent.
of pensionable salaries at the valuation date.
In addition, a special lump sum was paid in the year of 1.2 million 2002: 0.9 million to accelerate the improvement in the Plans funding level.
The total normal cost for the Group of 0.3 million 2002: 0.7 million, including amounts payable to personal pensions, is included in administration expenses.
A prepayment of 2.8 million 2002: 1.2 million, representing the excess of employer contributions over accumulated pension costs, is included within current assets.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 April 2002 and updated by a qualified independent actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the Plan at 31 March 2003.
Plan assets are stated at their market value at 31 March 2003.
