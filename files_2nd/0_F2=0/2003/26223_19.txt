The largest impact on UK life and pensions business in 2003 was from the tightening of future persistency assumptions and the strengthening of provisions for claims on the endowment book, and in 2002, was from an improvement in annuitant mortality and other related demographic assumption changes.

The above reconciliation is provided in the spirit of the guidance provided by the Auditing Practices Board to auditors.
It has been concluded that the AP and MSS accounting bases are so fundamentally different in the way that profits are cast, particularly as to the timing of profit recognition, that it is not meaningful to provide a reconciliation between them.
Other than in respect of long term business, shareholder net worth is identical for both AP and MSS bases.
