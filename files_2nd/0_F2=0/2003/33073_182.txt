The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment medical plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
Accounting policies With effect from 1 January 2003, the Group accounts for pensions and similar benets under the United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17.
Figures for prior years have been restated.
In accordance with the new standard, the operating and nancing costs of dened benefit plans are recognised separately in the profit and loss account: service costs are systematically spread over the service lives of employees, and nancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The costs of individual events such as past service benefit enhancements, settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The liabilities and, where applicable, the assets of dened benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The charges to the profit and loss account for dened contribution plans are the company contributions payable and the assets of such plans are not included in the Group balance sheet.
All dened benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
Group policy is that the most important plans representing over 75% of the dened benefit liabilities are formally valued every year and other principal plans accounting for approximately a further 15% of liabilities have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for other plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
Prior to 1 January 2003, the Group accounted for pensions and similar obligations under the UK accounting standard SSAP 24.
The objective of that standard was to spread pension costs systematically over the service lives of employees and for the regular costs to be a reasonably stable percentage of pay.
In line with the accounting objectives, assumptions were generally set reecting long-term expectations and with asset values smoothed relative to market values.
Under SSAP 24, unlike FRS 17, all components of pension expense were recognised in operating profit.
Had the Group continued to account for pensions and similar obligations in 2003 under SSAP 24, the charge to operating profit would have been 561 million 2002: 416 million: 2001: 326 million, there would have been no charge to nancing cost and the charge to profit after tax would have been 361 million 2002: 261 million: 2001: 205 million.
No gains or losses would have been recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
Healthcare In December 2003 the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernisation Act became law in the US.
Under the provisions of this Act, the Groups US healthcare benefit plan will be able to benefit from a subsidy towards the cost of prescription drugs.
In order to be eligible to receive this subsidy it is expected that we will need to make minor changes to the rules of the Groups US plan.
Until these changes are made, no recognition of the drug subsidy is reected in the Group accounts.
Preliminary estimates indicate that once eligible, the Groups liability will reduce by approximately 55 million and the ongoing service cost would reduce by an immaterial amount.
