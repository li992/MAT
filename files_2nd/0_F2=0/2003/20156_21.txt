In previous years, interest payable, other than that relating to TH Technologieholding GmbH group, was allocated to the financing of assets which could only earn future revenue profits and was therefore charged to revenue profits.

10 Directors emoluments Details of Directors emoluments are contained within the Remuneration report on pages 30 to 37.
11 Pension arrangements The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme, which covers most employees, is the 3i Group Pension Plan the Plan.
The cost of the Plan recognised in the accounts was 12 million 2002: 13 million and other plans was 3 million 2002: 3 million.
This is a funded defined benefit scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Groups finances and are administered by trustees.
The Group accounts for pension arrangements in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24.
The Plan is the subject of an actuarial valuation every three years.
The last full valuation was made at 30 June 2001 on the projected unit method.
At that date, the market value of the assets was 246 million, and the actuarial value of the assets taken to be market value was sufficient to cover 92% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for assumed increases in earnings and benefits.
The principal assumptions were as follows: Accrued Future liabilities contributions Price inflation 2.7% 2.7% Rate of return pre-retirement 8.2% 8.6% Rate of return post-retirement 5.2% 5.5% Salary increases excluding promotion 5.2% 5.2% Pension increases 3.0% 3.0% The deficit at 30 June 2001 has been spread over a ten year period, the average remaining service lives of the existing employees, using the percentage of payroll method.
The net cost and contributions in respect of the main scheme comprises: 2003 2002 m m Regular cost 11 11 Variation from regular cost including interest 1 2 Net cost for the year 12 13 Contributions cash 25 22 As a result of adverse economic and market conditions since 30 June 2001, the market value of the Plans assets at 31 March 2003 would have been sufficient to cover 66% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for assumed increases in earnings and benefits.
If these conditions persist until the next triennial actuarial valuation of the Plan at 30 June 2004, the SSAP 24 based net cost will increase for 2005.
Following advice from independent actuaries, no employers contributions were made during the period from 1 July 1985 to 1 April 2002 except that during the year to 31 March 2002 two payments were made into the Plan totalling 22 million.
Employers contributions to the Plan recommenced on 1 April 2002.
For the year to 31 March 2003, standard contributions were agreed to be 31.5% of members pensionable salaries.
An additional 13 million was also paid on 31 March 2003.
An amount of 13 million 2002: nil included in prepayments represents the cumulative difference between the net pension cost and contributions made.
49 3i Report and accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts 11 Pension arrangements continued New employees joining 3i and the Plan after 1 September 2002 are required to contribute 5% of their monthly pensionable salaries.
Under its rules, the Plan was non contributory for employees, joining prior to 1 September 2002, from 1 April 1978 to 31 December 2002.
From 1 January 2003, the rules of the Plan were changed and employees who joined the Plan prior to 1 September 2002 were required to contribute 1% of monthly pensionable salary, currently this will increase by 1% each year to a target of 5% of pensionable salary.
After a review of the discretionary early retirement arrangements of the Plan, the employers standard contribution rate changed from 1 April 2003 to 29.2%.

Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS17 changes the basis of accounting for pensions and other post-retirement benefits.
Under the transitional arrangements for the introduction of FRS17, certain additional disclosures are required and these are given below.
The actuarial valuation at 30 June 2001 was updated to 31 March 2002 and 31 March 2003 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS17.
The Plans liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method.
The valuation for FRS17 purposes is based on the membership details and demographic assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation.
The Plan assets have been updated to market value as at 31 March 2003.
The key FRS17 assumptions used for the Plan were: 2003 2002 Price inflation 2.5% 2.5% Salary increases excluding promotion 4.0% 5.0% Pension increases 3.0% 3.0% Discount rate 5.6% 6.1% The assets of the Plan and their expected return were: Long term Long term rate of return 2003 rate of return 2002 expected at Value expected at Value 31 March 2003 m 31 March 2002 m Equities 7.5% 144 8.5% 212 Gilts 4.5% 42 Other 3.8% 27 5.2% 39 213 251 Present value of Plan liabilities 303 265 Net pension liability 90 14 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on this deficit because its utilisation is considered unlikely in the foreseeable future.

This has been allocated between the revenue reserve 5 million 2002: 9 million and the capital reserve 5 million 2002: 9 million based on the underlying nature of the cost.

As investment trusts are exempt from capital gains tax, the Groups capital return is largely not taxable.
Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group currently has and expects to continue to generate surplus tax losses.
A deferred tax asset in respect of these surplus losses is not recognised because their utilisation is considered unlikely in the foreseeable future.

The Groups policy is that fixed rate lending is matched with fixed rate borrowings and the interest rate resetting profile of variable rate lending is matched with that of variable rate borrowings through gearing the portfolio.
Financial instruments including interest rate swaps are used as part of this matching process.
Equity investments, which are mainly funded by shareholders funds but also partially by borrowings in similar currencies, give rise to an interest rate sensitivity gap as a result of the equity investments being non-interest bearing and having no fixed maturity date.
The interest rate sensitivity gap at 31 March 2003 was: More than More than More than three months six months one year but not but not but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Loans and advances to banks 412 105 10 527 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 228 55 283 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 438 67 65 328 438 1,336 Fixed income shares 228 228 Equity shares 2,375 2,375 Other assets 249 249 1,078 227 75 328 439 2,852 4,999 Liabilities Deposits by banks 316 104 3 423 Debt securities in issue 44 126 34 302 1,000 1,350 - Other liabilities 239 239 Subordinated liabilities 51 51 Shareholders funds 2,936 2,936 272 230 31 302 1,051 3,175 4,999 Interest rate sensitivity gap 806 3 106 26 612 323 Cumulative gap 806 803 909 935 323 59 3i Report and accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts 31 Interest rate sensitivity gap analysis continued More than three More than six More than one months but not months but not year but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Loans and advances to banks 509 54 563 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 161 30 191 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 496 98 95 273 446 1,408 Fixed income shares 324 324 Equity shares 3,377 3,377 Other assets 269 269 1,166 182 95 273 447 3,970 6,133 Liabilities Deposits by banks 448 68 3 519 Debt securities in issue 144 28 108 106 1,221 1,339 Other liabilities 246 246 Subordinated liabilities 84 84 Shareholders funds 3,945 3,945 592 40 111 106 1,305 4,191 6,133 Interest rate sensitivity gap 574 142 16 379 858 221 Cumulative gap 574 716 700 1,079 221 32 Currency exposures Currency rate risk emanates from the Groups international operations.
The policy regarding currency risk is set out in the Financial review on page 19.
Currency swaps are used as part of applying that policy.
The Groups structural currency exposures at 31 March 2003 were as follows: Variable Fixed Other Other net Short term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 397 496 1,450 688 14 200 1,244 2,001 Euro 91 181 656 69 113 42 259 667 US dollar 37 62 221 10 32 298 Swiss franc 38262 25 41 Swedish krona 120 217 20 354 96 Other 13614 39 14 25 Subtotal 129 314 1,181 105 209 312 273 935 Total 526 810 2,631 793 195 112 1,517 2,936 Variable Fixed Other Other net Short term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 572 534 2,178 503 80 71 1,034 2,744 Euro 72 155 841 186 61 53 231 909 US dollar 3 51 347 24 96 14 315 Swiss franc 6 27 1 22 12 Swedish krona 3 4 280 10 353 56 Other 8 63 19 14 55 21 Subtotal 78 224 1,558 240 193 406 300 1,201 Total 650 758 3,736 743 273 335 1,334 3,945 60 3i Report and accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts 33 Liquidity The Groups liquidity policy is based on a maturity ladder approach with all mismatch limits of cash flows between cumulative assets and cumulative liabilities over various time periods approved by the Board.
The limits for shorter periods are also agreed with the Financial Services Authority.
34 Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group does not have a trading book and it holds all assets and liabilities in a non-trading book.
Financial assets Quoted and unquoted equity investments and quoted fixed income shares are included in the consolidated balance sheet at market value or Directors valuation which equates to fair value.
Unquoted fixed income shares and loan investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
No liquid and active market exists, either for the unquoted fixed income share or loan investments or their component parts.
The fair value of other financial assets equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financial liabilities 3is borrowings finance loan investments, fixed income shares and equity shares.
As stated above, these unquoted loan and fixed income share investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
These investments are not shown at an estimated market value as no active and liquid market exists for them.
The Report and accounts therefore do not include any recognition of the effect of their yield being above or below current market yields.
However, Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures requires disclosure of the fair value of those elements of the Groups borrowings that are listed even though, in some cases, the market for those borrowings is not particularly active.
The remainder of the Groups borrowings, which are unlisted, do not have a liquid or active market.
The fair value of the listed element of financial liabilities at 31 March 2003 was 1,214 million 2002: 1,222 million, which compares with a book amount of 1,205 million 2002: 1,208 million.
These borrowings are used to fund investments which, in general, yield a net margin to the Group and which would therefore have a higher fair value than the fair value of the borrowing.
The fair value of other financial liabilities equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivatives The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The book value of derivatives represents net interest receivable payable on such instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
No unrealised gains or losses are included in the balance sheet.
The amount of unrecognised gains or losses at the balance sheet date equates to the difference between fair value and book value.
The fair values and book values at 31 March 2003 of the swaps were: Fair value Fair value Book value Book value 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Interest rate swaps 24 5 6 6 Currency swaps 21 2 2 1 45 3 8 7 All swaps held at 31 March 2003 mature before 31 March 2041.
The principal outstanding on currency swap agreements and notional principal outstanding on interest rate swap agreements were: 2003 2002 m m Fixed rate to variable rate 688 715 Variable rate to fixed rate 1,193 1,064 Variable rate to variable rate 170 175 Fixed rate to fixed rate 60 Included in the above are currency swaps amounting to 164 271 All financial instruments are unsecured.
However, 3i does not expect non-performance by the counterparties, whose credit ratings are reviewed regularly.

This is explained in note 12.
The remaining provision is expected to be largely utilised in the year to 31 March 2004.
Deferred tax Full provision has been made for deferred tax relating to capital allowances and other timing differences.

A deferred tax asset in respect of these surplus losses has not been recognised because their utilisation is considered unlikely in the foreseeable future.
38 Subordinated liabilities Subordinated liabilities comprise limited recourse funding from Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau KfW, a German federal bank.
This funding, which individually finances investment assets, is at various fixed rates of interest and maturity is dependent upon the disposal of the associated assets.
This funding is subordinated to other creditors of the individual group undertakings to which these funds have been advanced.
During March, 3i Group plc agreed to purchase from KfW c72 million 50 million owed by Technologieholding Fonds VC GmbH and Technologieholding Fonds NBL GmbH for a consideration of c9 million 6 million.
The final legal agreement was signed on 29 April 2003.
As an adjusting post balance sheet event this has been accounted for in the year to 31 March 2003 and results in a realised capital profit in the year of 39 million.
Additionally, during the year, 11 million of loans were waived by KfW.
