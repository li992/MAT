There were no adjustments to the retained loss for the year for the diluted loss per share computations.
In 2003 and 2002 share options were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share due to losses in 2003 and 2002, resulting in options being antidilutive.

As at 1 January 2003 the total issued share capital of the Group was 29,110,000.
At the date of the Scheme the total share capital allotted had increased to 29,256,000 and the share premium account amounted to 279,765,000.
"In accordance with the court order under the Scheme of Arrangement, the issued share capital and the share premium of Regus plc ""Old Regus"" at the effective date of the Scheme 1 December 2003 was cancelled against distributable reserves."
Distributable reserves were therefore increased by 309,021,000.
"The shareholders of Old Regus were issued with shares in Regus Group plc the ""Company"" on a one for one basis."
As a result, the Company had issued share capital of 29,256,000 being 585,120,290 ordinary shares of 5 pence each at the effective date of the Scheme.
No share premium was recognised in the Company on the issue of these shares under s131 of the Companies Act.
On a consolidated basis, the Scheme has been accounted for using merger accounting principles in accordance with FRS6 'Acquisitions and Mergers'.
As a result of the above transactions a merger reserve of 29,256,000 arises, which is included within other non-distributable reserves.

Currency exposure As explained in the Financial review, to mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas the Group borrows, where appropriate, in the local currencies arising from its net investments.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the Group companies and the Group.
qxd 5 4 04 5:18 pm Page 49 20 Financial instruments continued Fair value disclosures The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at 31 December.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
The table below is a summary of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instrument.
Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2002 000 000 000 000 Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Short-term borrowings 9,887 9,015 16,567 15,504 Long-term borrowings 16,981 13,681 19,659 15,899 Short-term deposits 20,896 20,896 29,545 29,545 Cash at bank and in hand 64,105 64,105 29,065 29,065 Summary of methods and assumptions Forward foreign currency contracts and currency options Fair value is based on market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
Short-term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value because the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Hedges There were no off-balance sheet unrecognised or on-balance sheet deferred gains or losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the end of the year.
