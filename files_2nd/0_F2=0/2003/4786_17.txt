Basis of Preparation The Dimension Data Group the Group comprises Dimension Data Holdings plc the Company and its subsidiaries.
The financial statements are prepared according to the historical cost convention and in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom.
Accounting Policies Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries and its share of associates.
The results of subsidiaries are included from the effective dates of acquisition until the effective dates of disposal.
All significant intergroup transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.
Turnover Turnover comprises the aggregate amounts receivable for the sale of goods and installation, maintenance and service.
Maintenance revenue and licence fees Maintenance revenue and licence fees are brought to account over the relevant contract periods.
Research and development Research and development costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill Where an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or associated company is made, any difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the attributable net assets is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was set off against reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 October 1998 is recognised within intangible fixed assets in the year of acquisition.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write off the goodwill over its economic life, depending on the nature of the acquisition, for a period not exceeding five years.
The unamortised balance is reviewed on a regular basis and, if an impairment in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which the circumstances have been determined.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates considered appropriate to reduce their book values to estimated residual values over the useful lives of the assets.
The following rates are applied: Leasehold land, buildings and improvements over the lease term.
Computer and workshop equipment 20-33.33% per annum.
Office furniture and equipment 10% per annum.
62 DIMENSION DATA Associated companies Associated companies are those companies, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exercises significant influence and in which it holds a long term equity interest.
The results of these companies are accounted for by means of the equity method, from the date they became investees, whereby the Groups share of the associated companies retained income for the year is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Attributable earnings or losses, less dividends received, are included with the book value of the investment in the consolidated balance sheet.
Provision is made where there has been an impairment in the carrying value of the investment.
Investments Investments other than investments in associates and joint ventures are reflected at the lower of cost and fair value in the balance sheet.
Fair value for unquoted investments represents the Directors valuation after taking into account any impairment.
Fair value of quoted investments represents market value.
Investments held by Protocol are stated at valuation in terms of the standards endorsed by the British Venture Capital Association.
Valuations are based on arms length transactions which took place and valuation surpluses or losses included in operating income.
Where no such transaction took place, the investment is assessed for impairment and any valuation losses written off to operating income.
No account is taken of valuation surpluses indicated by the impairment review.
In the case of listed investments, the quoted share price at year end is used to value the investment.
All subsidiaries of Protocol are consolidated in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried in the parent company balance sheet at cost less provisions for permanent impairment in value.
Accounting for foreign investments The balance sheets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries, together with investments in overseas associated undertakings, are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings are translated at the weighted average rates of exchange for the year.
The exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment and profit for the financial year at the closing rate, are taken to reserves.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of the weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Redundant and slow-moving stocks are identified and written down with regard to their estimated economic or realisable values.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Speculative use of financial instruments or derivatives is not permitted and none has occurred during any period presented.

The non-interest bearing financial liabilities relate to deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions which will be paid in either cash or shares at the discretion of the purchaser.
Such amounts are mainly due for settlement on demand or within one year of the balance sheet date.
Floating rate balances relate to bank loans, overdrafts and loans.
Interest is based on the relevant interbank rate.

The Group has entered into certain forward exchange contracts which do not relate to specific items appearing in the balance sheet.
These contracts were entered into to cover foreign commitments not yet due.
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of these forward exchange contracts.
Financial Instruments Continued 27 d Hedging The Groups policy is to hedge all material transactional currency exposure and currency exposure on future expected purchases using forward currency contracts.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
There were no speculative positions in foreign currencies at the year ends, and there were no material gains or losses from such positions for any period presented.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposure arising on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies as soon as there is a firm contractual commitment.
It also uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile.
An analysis of the unrecognised gains and losses is as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses $'000 $'000 $'000 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 October 2002 23 2,516 2,493 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised this year 23 2,516 2,493 Gains and losses arising before 1 October 2002 that were not recognised in the year - - - Gains and losses arising in the year to 30 September 2003 that were not recognised in that year 26 3,663 3,637 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 30 September 2003 expected to be recognised in the year to 30 September 2004 26 3,663 3,637 27 e Currency profile The main functional currency of the Group is the US dollar, being the currency in which the majority of purchases are denominated and to which most of the selling prices are linked.
Other major currencies are the South African rand, Sterling, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar and the Euro.
Monetary assets and liabilities are hedged and therefore there are no transactional exposures which would give rise to net currency gains or losses in the profit and loss account.
Pension Schemes In most countries, the employing company provides either defined contribution or insured retirement plans to their employees.
The relevant company, and in some cases the employees, pay regular contributions to the plans.
Once contributions are made, the relevant company has no liability in respect of these plans.
Employees in France, Japan and Korea are entitled to lump-sum termination indemnity payments upon leaving.
Provisions have been established in respect of these liabilities.
