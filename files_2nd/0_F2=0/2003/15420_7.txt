On 10 July 2003, the group acquired NFO WorldGroup, Inc. NFO.
Given the extent of integration that had occurred by the end of 2003, it is not possible to accurately identify turnover and operating profit relating to the acquired business separately from the existing TNS business.
For this reason, the results of NFO have been included within continuing operations.
