29 Equity-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2003, the Group had a number of equity-based compensation plans: i All-Employee Option Plans Local All-Employee Option Plans have been set up in 16 countries to enhance employee involvement with Unilever and its performance by providing a potential financial benefit linked to the Unilever share price.
There are no individual performance targets to be met.
The plans permit participation by all permanent employees in the country where the relevant plan applies.
ii Executive Option Plans The Executive Option Plans were introduced in 1985 to reward key employees throughout the world for their contribution to the enhancement of the Groups longer-term future and their commitment to the Group over a sustained period.
The grant is dependent on performance of the Group and the individual.
iii The Share Matching Plans If managers invest part of their annual bonus in Unilever shares, the company will match this with the same number of shares on the condition that they keep all shares for an agreed number of years and will still be employed by Unilever on the vesting date.
iv The TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and, depending on the TSR ranking see page 20 of Unilever in comparison with its peer group, it will potentially award top executives on the vesting date three years later with between 0% and 200% of the original conditional award.
v The Restricted Share Plan Restricted shares are awarded to a select number of executives for special performance.
After the agreed number of years the awards will vest provided the executives are still employed by Unilever at that time.
vi The North American Performance Share Plan A long-term incentive plan for North American managers, awarding Unilever shares if company and personal performance targets are met over a three-year period.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of Executive Option Plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all Plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
In recent years we have met the obligations under our share option and award plans by purchasing shares in advance and transferring them, in return for the exercise price, to Directors and employees as the options are exercised.
