The accounting treatment for these instruments is dependent upon whether they are entered into for trading or non-trading hedging purposes.
Trading Derivatives held for trading purposes are recognised in the 140 accounts at fair value.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are included in dealing profits in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Where representative market prices are not available, the fair value is determined from current market information using appropriate pricing or valuation models.
Adjustments are made to quoted market prices where appropriate to cover credit risk, liquidity risk and future operational costs.
In the consolidated balance sheet, positive fair values assets of trading derivatives are included in Other assets and negative fair values liabilities in Other liabilities.
Positive and negative fair values of trading derivatives are offset where the contracts have been entered into under master netting agreements or other arrangements that give a legally enforceable right of set-off.
Non-trading Non-trading derivatives are entered into by the Group to hedge exposures arising from transactions entered into in the normal course of banking activities.
They are recognised in the accounts in accordance with the accounting treatment of the underlying transaction or transactions being hedged.
To be classified as non-trading, a derivative must match or eliminate the risk inherent in the hedged item from potential movements in interest rates, exchange rates or market values.
In addition, there must be a demonstrable link to an underlying transaction, pool of transactions or specified future transaction or transactions.
Specified future transactions must be reasonably certain to arise for the derivative to be accounted for as a hedge.
In the event that a non-trading derivative transaction is terminated or ceases to be an effective hedge, the derivative is re-measured at fair value and any resulting profit or loss amortised over the remaining life of the underlying transaction or transactions being hedged.
If a hedged item is derecognised, or a specified future transaction is no longer likely to occur, the related non-trading derivative is remeasured at fair value and the resulting profit or loss taken to the profit and loss account.
16 Sale and repurchase transactions Securities which have been sold with an agreement to repurchase continue to be shown on the balance sheet and the sale proceeds recorded as a deposit.
Securities acquired in reverse sale and repurchase transactions are not recognised in the balance sheet and the purchase price is treated as a loan.
The difference between the sale price and repurchase price is accrued evenly over the life of the transaction and charged or credited to the profit and loss account as interest payable or receivable.

A substantial proportion of such reserves are required to be retained by the overseas undertakings to meet local regulatory requirements.
2 Deferred tax assets of 127 million 2002 107 million resulting from tax losses carried forward have not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that the asset will be recoverable.
These assets may be recoverable if the losses can be offset against suitable future taxable profits arising in the same tax jurisdiction.
3 The fair values of certain financial assets are disclosed in Note 40.
The tax that could be payable if these assets were disposed of at the values shown is estimated at 561 million 2002 965 million.
Because of the nature of these financial assets which are held as part of the banking business, it is not possible to determine the amount that may become payable in the foreseeable future.
4 Freehold and long leasehold properties are revalued see Note 20.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing Group properties except where there is a commitment to sell the asset and any taxable gain will not be subject to rollover relief.
The tax that could be payable if these assets were disposed of at their revalued amount is estimated at 109 million 2002 81 million, including tax on rolled over gains see note 5 below.
No such tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future.
5 No provision has been made for deferred tax on certain gains realised on disposals of property and other assets as there is an expectation of rolling over such gains into replacement assets.
Expenditure to date on valid replacement assets together with forecasts of future such expenditure indicate that these gains will be available for rollover relief.
The tax that could be payable if the conditions for rollover relief were not met is estimated at 68 million 2002 93 million.

Freehold and long leasehold properties are revalued on a rolling basis, each property being valued at least every five years.
Interim valuations outwith the five year cycle are carried out on properties where there is an indication that their value has changed significantly, given market conditions.
The directors are not aware of any material change in the valuation of the Groups properties and therefore no additional interim valuations were required.
Properties occupied by the Group are valued on the basis of Existing Use Value, except for certain specialised properties which are valued on a Depreciated Replacement Cost basis.
Investment properties and properties to be disposed of are valued to reflect Open Market Value.
Valuations are carried out by internal and external qualified surveyors who are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or, in the case of some overseas properties, locally qualified valuers.

The value of the long-term assurance business is calculated by discounting estimated future flows of statutory profits from in-force business at a discount rate that includes a risk margin.
The future flows are based on prudent assumptions about long-term economic and business experience determined with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The risk margin is designed to reflect uncertainties in expected future flows.

2 Fair values of derivatives are determined by market prices where available.
Otherwise fair value is based on current market information using appropriate valuation models.
3 The fair value of deposits repayable on demand is equal to their carrying value.
The fair values of term deposits and time certificates of deposit are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
4 For loans which reprice frequently or are linked to the Groups base rate, and for which there has been no significant change in credit risk since inception, carrying value represents a reasonable estimate of fair value.
For other loans, fair values are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows, using current interest rates appropriate to the type of loan, and making adjustments for credit risk.
5 Fair values of marketable securities are based on quoted market prices.
Where these are unavailable, fair value is estimated using other valuation techniques.
6 The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.
The fair value of other debt securities in issue is based on quoted market prices where available, or where these are unavailable, is estimated using other valuation techniques.
7 The fair value of loan capital, non-equity minority interests and preference shares is based on quoted market prices where available.
For unquoted loan capital, fair value has been estimated using other valuation techniques.
8 Fair values are not given for financial commitments and contingent liabilities.
The diversity of the fee structures, the lack of an established market and the difficulty of separating the value of the instruments from the value of the overall relationship involve such uncertainty that it is not meaningful to provide an estimate of their fair value.
The principal amounts of these instruments are given in Note 41.

Under this standard, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortised and are subject to annual impairment tests.
Other intangible assets continue to be amortised over their useful lives.
The Group has completed the impairment tests required under SFAS 142 and no impairment has been recognised as a result.

Consumer and Commercial retained interests have been stressed on a security level basis.
The sensitivities depicted in the preceding table are retained interest is calculated without changing any other hypothetical and should be used with caution.

Special purpose entities SPEs The Group has elected to apply the provisions of FIN 46R in its 2003 accounts.
The Group reviewed its SPEs in light of FIN 46R and has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of a number of commercial paper conduits and other asset securitisation vehicles that meet FIN 46Rs definition of a variable interest 198 entity.
These entities, with total assets of 6.9 billion at 31 December 2003, acquire financial assets from third parties or from the Group funded by the issue of commercial paper or other debt instruments.
The Group supplies certain administrative services and provides credit enhancement, liquidity facilities and derivative transactions to some or all of these entities on an arms length basis.
In the case of commercial paper conduits, the Group provides programme-wide credit enhancement by letters of credit or loan facilities across all tranches of assets funded by conduits.
Trust preferred securities The trust preferred securities referred to in Note 32 3 and 4 on page 167, represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of trusts, which consist of partnership preferred securities representing non-cumulative perpetual preferred limited partnership interests issued by Delaware limited partnerships.
The Group has provided subordinated guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities and the partnership preferred securities.
Under the terms of the guarantees, the Group has fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a subordinated basis, payments on such trust preferred securities and partnership preferred securities, to the extent they are due to be paid and have not been paid by, or on behalf of the trusts and the partnerships, as the case may be: any due and payable distributions on the trust preferred securities or partnership preferred securities the redemption price required to be paid for each trust preferred security or partnership preferred security called for redemption: and upon a dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the trust or partnership, any amounts due in respect of the trust preferred securities or partnership preferred securities, through to the date of payment.
The application of FIN 46 and FIN 46R has resulted in the deconsolidation of trust preferred securities and partnership preferred securities issued by the Groups subsidiaries.
The deconsolidation of these securities has resulted in a balance sheet reclassification from minority interests to subordinated liabilities.
The effect on US GAAP net income and equity is negligible.
