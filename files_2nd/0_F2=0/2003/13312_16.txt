INTANGIBLE Goodwill at 1st January 177.0 ASSETS Exchange adjustments 1.9 Businesses acquired note 30 16.8 Goodwill at 31st December 195.7 Under the provisions of the accounting policy set out on page 51, goodwill is carried as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.
The directors have reviewed these acquisitions and have determined that, as service businesses which are not subject to high volatility in fashions or markets, demand for these services is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Hence neither the value of these businesses nor the associated goodwill have a measurable useful economic life and the goodwill is therefore not being amortised.
The useful economic lives and values of the businesses and goodwill were re-assessed as at 31st December 2003.

DERIVATIVES The table opposite provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the groups AND OTHER financial assets and financial liabilities at 31st December 2003 and 2002.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial FINANCIAL instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties other than a INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at relevant interest and exchange rates.

The fair value of other short term borrowings and long term borrowings under which short term drawings are made under committed credit facilities which mature in October 2006 approximate to their book values given their short term maturity.
Other debtors include a balance of 143.0m 2002 restated: 135.8m in respect of a convertible loan note issued by Ashtead Group plc Ashtead in partial consideration for their purchase of our former US plant services business.
The note has a final maturity date of 31st March 2008 and interest accrues at 5.25% per annum.
At 31st December 2003 9.0m 2002 restated: 1.8m of this balance is represented by accrued interest.
In March 2003 the board of Ashtead announced that it had defaulted under its banking arrangements as a direct result of uncertainties in the current and prior year reported results of its US Sunbelt Rental business.
These uncertainties have since been resolved.
Ashtead has also taken a number of steps to improve its financial reporting controls and has also renegotiated its medium-term financing agreements to resolve the existing defaults thereunder.
As part of these steps, on 30th May 2003, the convertible note holder, BET Ltd, agreed to certain amendments to the original terms of the convertible note.
These amendments included the deferral of the interest payments due for the period 1st April 2003 to 31st January 2005 until the earlier of 31st January 2005 or the date of a full refinancing of Ashteads senior debt.
Interest continues to accrue at the original note rate of 5.25%p.
a. compounding on the respective original interest repayment due dates.
A refinancing fee of 1.5m will also be payable by Ashtead on the earlier of 31st January 2005 or the date of a full refinancing of Ashteads senior debt.
On 22nd January 2004 Ashtead announced its interim results for the six months to 31st October 2003 and updated the market on its trading prospects.
These indicated both a gradually improving trading position and continuing emphasis on cash flow generation from operations and selective non-core asset disposals.
Ashtead also stated that it continued to examine options for refinancing their bank facilities and remain confident that they will do so well before January 2005 particularly given the favourable indicators seen regarding the economic recovery in the USA.
Ashtead also said that whilst no guarantee could be given that they would be able to refinance, they would, as time progresses, review other options in parallel to facilitate repayment of their facilities.
Since their recent trading announcement the Ashtead share price has risen from 18.0p to 30.0p as at the date of this report.
On 24th March 2004, Ashtead announced the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as their auditors upon the resignation of the previous auditors  LLP.
DERIVATIVES In accordance with FRS 13 disclosure requirements a fair value of 114.6m 2002 restated: 135.8m has been ascribed to AND OTHER the convertible note.
This has been calculated after discounting the cash flows of the note in accordance with the FINANCIAL conditions prevailing at 31st December 2003 at the then market interest rates and after due adjustment for credit risk.
INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED No fair value sum has been ascribed to the equity conversion option given that the option conversion strike price of 1.50 is at significant variance to Ashteads share price at 31st December 2003 of 15.5p.
The company will continue to monitor any further announcements by Ashtead and take any steps as may be required in the future to protect the note holders legal rights.
Debtors include 1.9m 2002: 9.4m of interest bearing and 2.5m 2002: 9.0m of non interest bearing notes and deferred consideration received in respect of non-core business disposals.
The notes deferred consideration have final maturities between 2004 and 2008, although earlier repayments may be precipitated under the terms of the respective disposal notes sale agreements.
The group does utilise foreign currency short term and long term borrowings to hedge overseas acquisitions and investments.
Any differences between the book values and the fair values for these borrowings are shown on page 63.
Currency exposures As explained in the Finance Directors Review on page 17 the groups currency borrowings including those held in its main operating businesses are used to hedge the exchange effects arising from the retranslation of its net overseas investments.
Gains and losses arising on net overseas investments and the currency borrowings used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses in accordance with SSAP 20.
The groups businesses provide goods and services in their local economies, sourced predominately from the local economies.
As a consequence the groups businesses do not have any material transactional currency exposures nor any material foreign currency assets or liabilities by reference to their reporting currencies.

PENSION The group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The major schemes COMMITMENTS are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the United Kingdom is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants and a defined contribution section.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent actuarial valuation was at 1st April 2002.
It was carried out using the projected unit method and the principal assumptions made by the independent professional actuary were that pensions would increase by either 2.7% per annum or 3.6% per annum, pensionable salaries would increase by 3.8% per annum and pensions would be discounted back to the valuation date using discount rates of 6.7% per annum for the period after retirement and 7.2% per annum for the period before retirement.
The market value of the schemes assets totalled 613.9m as at 1st April 2002.
However, for the purposes of the valuation, the assets were adjusted by 55.6m to reflect the underperformance of the schemes actual investments relative to a portfolio of bonds over the preceding three years.
The combined value of the assets and the above smoothing adjustment represented 115% of the value of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries and pensions.
In light of the results of the 2002 actuarial valuation, the company is resuming contributions to the defined benefit sections of the scheme of approximately 8.0m in March 2004.
Thereafter it is anticipated that further annual payments will be necessary currently estimated to be 12.0m in March 2005.
The world-wide pension cost for the group was 15.2m 2002: 12.4m of which 4.5m 2002: 3.1m related to the groups total UK pension cost which was calculated using the same assumptions as above.
The above UK pension cost makes allowance for a credit of 5.0m in respect of experience surpluses that are being recognised over 11 years, the average future service lives of employees in the scheme.
There is a prepayment of 14.9m see note 14 in the groups balance sheet 2002: 19.4m in respect of the UK scheme resulting from the difference between contributions paid and pension costs charged to date.
The additional disclosures required under FRS 17 are shown below.
These relate only to the main UK scheme but they would not be materially different if they included the defined benefit schemes which operate in other countries.
The numbers shown in this disclosure have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK scheme as at 1st April 2002 updated by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31st December 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31st December 2003.
