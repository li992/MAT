It was concluded that as a result of the significant impact of the events of 11 September 2001 on the trading prospects of the business, the value of certain assets was impaired and an exceptional impairment charge of 27m was recognised see below for details.
In arriving at this charge, assumptions were made about the rate of recovery of the US travel market.
However, these assumptions proved optimistic and a further impairment charge was taken at the half year.
At the half year, an exceptional write down of US$55m 35m was charged to operating profit.
The charge has been applied against goodwill US$15m 9m and xed assets US$40m 26m.
The Board have reviewed the carrying value of the US business following the write down of the assets taken at the half year.
As a result of the most recent review, no further impairment charge has been taken.
As identied in Note 28, the Group announced the conditional sale of the USA Travel Retail Hotel and Airports businesses on Thursday 18 September 2003. b Surplus property provisions As a result of a sub-tenant default and a deterioration in the London commercial property market in the last 12 months, there is a requirement to signicantly increase the provision for onerous leases.
Following a review of the provision at year end, it has been increased by 12m.

3 Pensions arrangements a Restatement of comparatives Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benets FRS 17 has been adopted with effect from 1 September 2002.
The adoption of FRS 17 has required a change to the accounting treatment of pensions and the prior year results have been restated accordingly as follows: i Consolidated balance sheet Other creditors Provisions for due after more liabilities Net pension profit and m Debtors than one year and charges liabilities loss account At 31 August 2002 196 3 28 215 Adoption of FRS 17 4 1 3 104 104 31 August 2002 restated 192 2 25 104 111 Under FRS 17, the difference between the market value of the assets of the Groups principal dened benefit pension funds and the present value of accrued pension liabilities is shown as an asset or liability on the balance sheet, net of deferred tax.
Previously, the only balance sheet items were a prepayment representing the cumulative difference between pension charges included in the profit and loss account, and actual payments made to the scheme and a provision for un-funded pension obligations and other post retirement benets.
ii Consolidated profit and loss account profit Operating attributable to m profit Interestshareholders At 31 August 2002 89 52 Adoption of FRS 17 13 8 5 31 August 2002 restated 76 8 47 The profit and loss charge, under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice Accounting for pension costs SSAP 24, comprised a regular pension cost net of spreading of the surplus over the average remaining service lives of the relevant employees and a notional interest credit.
Under FRS 17, the following items are included in the profit and loss account: Charged to operating profit the full service cost of pension provision relating to the period, together with the costs of any benets relating to past service.
Included in interest a charge equal to the expected increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities because the benets are closer to settlement and netted against this: a credit equivalent to the Groups long-term expected return on assets based on market value of the scheme assets at the start of the period.
Included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses is the difference between the expected return on pension assets at the start of the period and the actual return achieved along with the differences, which arise from experience or assumption changes, in pension liabilities.
If FRS 17 had not been adopted for the year ended 31 August 2003, profit on ordinary activities before taxation would have been 30m and profit on ordinary activities after taxation would have been 1m.
The corresponding net assets would have been 583m.
53 WH Smith PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts for the 12 months to 31 August 2003 continued 3 Pensions arrangements continued b Pension plans The Group operates pension plans in a number of countries around the world.
Pension arrangements for UK employees are operated through two dened benefit schemes WHSmith Pension Trust and Hodder Headline Staff Retirement Benets Plan and a dened contribution scheme, WHSmith Pension Builder.
The most significant is the dened benefit WHSmith Pension Trust for the Groups UK employees.
In other countries, benets are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided accordingly.
There are dened benefit arrangements in the UK and the United States of America with the remainder being either dened contribution or state sponsored schemes.
The assets of the pension plans are held in separate funds administered by Trustees, which are independent of the Groups nances.
WHSmith Pension Trust The latest full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2003 by independent actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting, using the market value basis.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
This scheme was closed in September 1995 and under the projected unit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as members approach retirement and the aged prole of members increases.
The Group has reached agreement with the pension trustees to substantially increase the contributions to fund the deficit.
Annual cash contributions of 42m have been approved for the year ended 31 August 2004.
This will be subject to an annual review.
Hodder Headline Staff Retirement Benets Plan The latest full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 1 July 2001 by independent actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting, using the projected unit method.
Annual cash contributions of 2m have been approved for the year ended 31 August 2004.
Pension valuations The valuation of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes used for the FRS 17 disclosures are based upon the most recent actuarial valuations.
These have been updated by professionally qualied actuaries Mercer Human Resource Consulting to take into account the requirements of FRS 17 and to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 August 2003.

Goodwill arising on the earlier acquisitions of John Menzies Retail, Internet Bookshop and WGL Retail Holdings Limited is regarded by the directors as having a useful life of 20 years and is therefore amortised through the profit and loss account over this period.
In accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, where goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite life, it is not amortised but is subject to an annual test for impairment.
As permitted under FRS 10, this represents a departure, for the purposes of giving a true and fair view, from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, which requires goodwill to be amortised.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Hodder Headline 172m, Wayland 3m, John Murray 14m and Robert Gibson 1m is regarded as having an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortised in the profit and loss account.
It is considered that the purchased goodwill is durable because these businesses are expected to maintain their market share and profitability in UK publishing over a long period.
The majority of titles published and imprint names have significant lifespans due to copyright and licensing arrangements and range and strength of backlist titles.
It is also considered that the barriers to entry which exist and are anticipated to continue and the nature of competition in the publishing industry are such that scale, relationships with third parties, intellectual property rights and quality of branding will prove this goodwill to be durable.
Since it is not possible to identify a nite useful life for goodwill on the purchase of Hodder Headline, Wayland, John Murray and Robert Gibson it is not possible to quantify any amortisation that would be charged.
The application of an impairment test which is carried out annually supports the value of goodwill and, as a result, no charge for impairment is required at the balance sheet date.

This is a trust established for the benefit of all WHSmith employees, the Trustee of which is an independent trust company based in Jersey.
The Trustee purchases the Groups ordinary shares in the open market with nancing provided by the Group as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated share liabilities of the Group.
The difference between the cost of the shares expected to be awarded, and any anticipated proceeds under each plan, is amortised evenly over the period of service to which the award of shares relates.
Dividends are waived for all ordinary shares held by the Trust.
All shares are under option within the share option schemes.
Investment in associated undertakings represent a 50 per cent stake in four companies held by WH Smith Aspac Ltd.

The Groups policies with regards derivatives for managing these risks, which have remained unchanged since 1 September 1998, are reviewed and agreed with the Board.

The only material foreign exchange exposure at 31 August 2003 relates to the financial assets and liabilities in USA Travel Retail and Aspac in Australia and New Zealand.
Cash at bank and in hand includes 10m of US dollars 2002: 16m, 10m of Australian dollars 2002: 8m, 7m of New Zealand dollars 2002: 8m, 1m of Euros 2002: nil, 1m of Hong Kong dollars 2002: nil and 1m of Singapore dollars 2002: 1m.
b Sterling oating rate debt constitutes 20m of unsecured loan notes.
These loan notes are repayable at par on-demand up until expiry on 28 February 2008 and bear an interest rate of 100 basis points below six month LIBOR.
At 31 August 2003, the Group had unutilised multi-currency revolving committed facilities of 200m, of which 67m, which bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points, expires in May 2004 with a one year extension option renewable annually until May 2006 and 133m, which bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points, expires in May 2007. c Sterling xed rate debt constitutes 5.125 per cent undated unsecured redeemable at par loan stock of 2m 2002: 2m.
d In addition to the above, at 31 August 2003 the Group had unredeemed B shares of 2m 2002: 2m which carry a net non-cumulative preferential dividend set at 75 per cent of six month LIBOR.
The Groups financial instruments are dened by FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments and comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors, trade creditors etc.
that arise directly from its operations.
In addition the Group has significant property operating leases, described in Note 6.
The Group is required to state under FRS 13 that it has applied an exemption available from making disclosures of short-term debtors and creditors.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group nances its operations through a mixture of share capital, retained profits, trade credit and bank borrowings and currently holds surplus cash.
The Group has entered into a limited number of derivative transactions and has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
The Groups use of derivatives is primarily to hedge certain product purchases and have been approved by the Board.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Interest rate risk: The Groups xed interest debt principally comprises a loan of 2m which was entered into in connection with previous nancing strategies and which is repayable at the Groups option.
Cash deposits and remaining debt are at variable rates.
The Groups interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities, maturity of financial liabilities and borrowing facilities are described in the table above.
Liquidity risks: The Group has committed facilities available of 200m, of which 67m expires in May 2004 and 133m expires in May 2007.
Foreign currency risk: Approximately 12 per cent of the Groups turnover and 11 per cent of its net operating assets are denominated in foreign currencies.
The effect of uctuations in exchange rates in the year compared to the previous period was to decrease sales by approximately 9m and increase profits by approximately 2m.
The Group has three significant international subsidiaries which operate in the USA, Australia and New Zealand and whose revenues and expenses are denominated principally in US dollars, Australian dollars and New Zealand dollars respectively.
At 31 August 2003, the Group did not finance its net investment in its subsidiaries by means of foreign currency borrowings although the appropriateness of doing so is kept under review.
Currency exposures: At 31 August 2003, the Group had no material currency exposures that would give rise to net currency gains or losses being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities: At 31 August 2003, there was no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their book value.
Gains and losses on hedges: During the period, the Group entered into certain forward currency contracts.
The fair value of these contracts at 31 August 2003 is nil.
Market price risk: The Groups exposure to market price risk comprises interest rate risk and currency risk.
It regularly monitors these exposures and considers from time to time whether there would be a benefit in hedging these risks.
In general, the Group avoids the use of derivatives or other financial instruments in circumstances when the outcome would effectively be largely dependent upon speculation on future rate movements.
The effect on the results for the 12 months to 31 August 2003 of a 10 per cent variation in relevant interest rates would have had negligible effect on the profit before tax and exceptional items.
A 10 per cent variation in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies would change the profit before tax and exceptional items by approximately 1 per cent.
