The Groups obligation for these benefits at Pilkington North America Inc was assessed by independent qualified actuaries at 1st April 2002 using the projected unit credit method.
The underlying assumptions used in this actuarial review were healthcare costs increasing by four per cent per annum and the discount rate to determine the liability of 6.75 per cent.

c Minority interests in German subsidiary undertakings In 1989 Pilkington Holding GmbH formerly Pilkington Deutschland GmbH made an offer to acquire the minority interests in Pilkington Deutschland AG formerly Flachglas AG and Dahlbusch AG.
If the remaining minority shareholders in these companies as at 31st March 2003 accept such an offer, the cost will be 37 million 26 million in addition to the 143 million 99 million paid to those who accepted the offer prior to 31st March 2003.
Certain minority shareholders have legally challenged the offer as insuffcient.
In the case related to Pilkington Deutschland AG, the court has decided that the offer price should be increased from 295 per 26 share to 350.
The effect of this decision is to increase the amount payable to those shareholders of Pilkington Deutschland AG, who have already accepted the offer to purchase, by 9 million 6 million, and to increase the amount payable to the remaining minority shareholders by 6 million 4 million.
The court also decided that the guaranteed dividend, which was an alternative offered by Pilkington Holding GmbH to the minority shareholders, should not be increased.
The decision of the court is being appealed by Pilkington Holding GmbH and the minority shareholders and it is expected that there will be no decision by the appeal court before the end of 2003.
The court dealing with the Dahlbusch AG case has not yet issued its judgement.
A court appointed valuer has proposed an increase in the offer price of approximately 19 per cent and an increase in the guaranteed dividend of approximately 14 per cent.
These valuation opinions do not constitute rulings and are not binding on the court, which has asked the parties to review and comment on them.
Indeed, similar opinions were presented in the Pilkington Deutschland AG case, and rejected by the court in that case.
The court in this case is unlikely to issue its decision before the end of 2003, and any such decision would be capable of being the subject of an appeal.
d Class action complaints Since July 1997 Pilkington and Pilkington North America Inc PNAI formerly Libbey-Owens-Ford Co, together with four other major glass companies, unrelated to Pilkington, have received class action complaints filed in US Federal, California, Kansas, Oregon, Tennessee and Wisconsin state courts alleging violation of the US anti-trust laws by conspiring to fix US float glass prices and to allocate customers amongst themselves.
In June 1999 Pilkington and PNAI entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the US Federal case under which Pilkington and PNAI paid an aggregate amount of US$17 million 11 million.
Pilkington and PNAI deny that they violated any anti-trust legislation and believe that they have good defences against these allegations.
The settlement was entered into in order to avoid the expense, inconvenience and burden of continued and protracted litigation.
Certain of the cases commenced in the state courts have been settled or dismissed.
The remaining cases commenced in the state courts are continuing, but the anticipated costs of settlement are not expected to be material.
e Other guarantees and contingent liabilities At 31st March 2003 the Group has guaranteed, in the ordinary course of business, bank loans of 4 million to third parties 2002 5 million.
The Group had other contingent liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business arising out of guarantees and other transactions, some of which are the subject of litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, the outcome of such litigation will not have a material effect on the Groups consolidated financial position.

44 PILKINGTON DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 39 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS The pension costs included within the financial statements are prepared in accordance with SSAP 24 and this will continue until FRS 17 is fully implemented to replace SSAP 24.
In the transitional period, FRS 17 requires companies to provide additional disclosures in respect of defined benefit arrangements.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes and similar obligations throughout the world.
Approximately 75 per cent of Group employees participate in defined contribution or government schemes, 10 per cent are members of defined benefit schemes principally in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand and the remaining 15 per cent are members of the UK based Pilkington Superannuation Scheme.
Outside the UK, pensions provided by defined benefit schemes are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration.
Where the schemes are funded in advance, the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
This does not apply in Germany or Austria where there are no separate pension assets, but provisions for the pension liability are held in those Pilkington subsidiaries accounts.
In addition to the pension arrangements referred to above there are the following additional arrangements: Post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits, principally in respect of employees, retirees and their dependants in the USA, details of which are referred to in note 28 a.
The Pilkington unfunded top-up arrangement for directors and certain senior executives is an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit arrangement providing defined benefits to members, whose earnings exceed the Inland Revenues cap on pensionable salary.
The Group charges the cost of the arrangement annually to the profit and loss account, as advised by the UK actuary, and holds these amounts as a provision in the balance sheet within pension provisions note 28 b. Statutory leaving service indemnity provisions are provided in respect of employees in certain European countries.
These are charged to the profit and loss account each year based on the service and salary of each employee and the provision is carried within other provisions note 28 e. a SSAP 24 pension costs The total pension cost for the Group is as follows: Defined benefit Defined contribution 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Europe 12 11 25 24 North America 4 5 8 9 Rest of the world 3 2 8 6 36 35 The pension cost in respect of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme in the UK amounted to 8 million 2002 8 million.
Independent actuarial valuations are undertaken at least triennially on varying dates for the Groups main defined benefit pension arrangements.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups plans vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which they are situated.
The actuarial valuations, based on the projected unit method, assume, on a weighted average basis, that the investment return will exceed the increase in the future earnings by 3.7 per cent 2002 3.8 per cent.
The actuarial value of the fund assets of these plans was sufficient to cover 82 per cent 2002 102 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members.
This deficit includes a 5 million deficit on the unfunded German pension arrangements, which is being charged over the remaining service lives of the German employees at 1 million per annum.
In Germany, the annual charge to the profit and loss account amounted to 9 million 2002 9 million.
The charge is based on an assumed six per cent investment return, which is fixed by law but salary and pension increase assumptions are not permitted.
In addition, there is a deficit of 69 million on the US pension schemes which is likely to result in additional charges to the profit and loss account in future years commencing in 2004 2005.
The market value of the assets of the Groups principal defined benefit plans at the date of the latest valuations was 321 million 2002 388 million.
Total accrued pension costs amounted to 3 million 2002 2 million and are included in other creditors note 24.
Provision for the benefit obligation of the unfunded plans referred to above amounted to 151 million 2002 139 million and are included in provisions note 28 b. b FRS 17 retirement benefits Whilst the SSAP 24 disclosure and measurement principles have been applied by the Group in accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits, FRS 17 on retirement benefits requires additional balance sheet and profit and loss account disclosures, the latter being required for the first time in 2003.
Group The disclosures set out below are divided between pensions, which cover the Groups defined benefit schemes and the statutory leaving service indemnity arrangements, and the Groups post-retirement healthcare arrangements.
For the disclosures made in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and the statutory leaving service indemnity arrangements, a further division has been made between these schemes and arrangements which are funded and those which are unfunded.
These disclosures match the Groups segmental disclosures between Europe, North America and the rest of the world.
All schemes and arrangements within North America and the rest of the world are funded, whereas some within Europe are funded and others are unfunded arrangements.
PILKINGTON DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 45 NOTES ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 39 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED There are 3,200 employees in the UK, and 12,000 pensioners who are members of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme.
Benefits payable are determined by reference to final salary.
However, under the trust deed governing the scheme, employers contributions are fixed at 10.5 per cent of pensionable salary for active members.
Under the deed the Group has no right of access to any investment surpluses but equally cannot be required to increase contributions to finance any deficits other than as may be required by legislation.
For this reason the trustees follow a prudent policy of management and the scheme is funded at over 1.3 times the minimum level at which additional funding would be required by legislation.
For this reason also, under SSAP 24, the scheme has historically been considered to be in the nature of a defined contribution scheme.
FRS 17 introduced new definitions for defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes but, unlike SSAP 24, it does not refer specifically to schemes such as the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme with features of both.
The disclosures required by FRS 17 for defined benefit schemes are given below in respect of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme but, as the Group has no right of access to the economic benefits relating to any surplus in the scheme, any resulting asset is not recognised.
Any deficit would only be recognised to the extent that Pilkington had a legal or a constructive obligation to meet the deficit.
Defined benefit pension schemes The FRS 17 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations as noted below updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31st March 2003.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their market values at 31st March 2003.

The defined benefit schemes are closed with the exception of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme, the UK unfunded top-up scheme, the Canadian retirement plan for salaried employees, the Pilkington Aerospace pension plan, the Pilkington New Zealand pension scheme and the Pilkington Australia superannuation scheme.
The German defined benefit pension scheme is closed to new members but continuing employees accrue pension rights covering their current employment.
In the schemes which are now closed to new members, the age profile of the membership is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as members of the schemes approach retirement.
46 PILKINGTON DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 39 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The principal financial assumptions calculated as weighted averages of the underlying schemes used to calculate the defined benefit liabilities and the longterm expected rate of return on investments under FRS 17 are as follows: 2003 2002 Europe North Rest of Europe North Rest of America the world America the world Funded Unfunded Funded Unfunded % %%% % %%% Salary increases 3.4 2.7 4.3 3.5 4.0 2.9 4.1 3.5 Pension increases 2.4 2.0 2.5 3.0 2.2 2.3 Discount rate 5.5 4.9 6.5 5.4 6.0 5.5 7.5 6.3 Inflation rate 2.4 2.0 2.5 2.5 3.0 2.1 2.7 2.5 Long-term expected rate of return At 31st March 2003 Equities 7.5 10.7 7.4 8.3 11.5 7.3 Bonds 4.8 5.4 5.0 5.5 5.5 5.0 Other 4.6 5.4 4.5 5.6 The Pilkington North America schemes are frozen, and therefore the salary increase assumption noted above relates only to the Pilkington Aerospace pension plan and the Canadian retirement plan.
The market values of the assets and the present value of the actuarial liabilities of the defined benefit schemes at 31st March 2003 are as follows: Europe North Rest of Total America the world Funded Unfunded m m m m m Bonds 406 49 8 463 Equities 553 103 19 675 Other 16 6 22 Total market value of assets 975 152 33 1,160 Present value of actuarial liabilities 975 185 249 34 1,443 Deficit 185 97 1 283 Related deferred tax asset 17 8 25 Net pension liability 168 89 1 258 The present value of the actuarial liabilities of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme was 975 million 2002 1,148 million.
975 million represents the present value of the liabilities of the scheme as at the reporting date, whereas the present value of the liabilities reported at 31st March 2002 included allowance for discretionary benefit increases.
The principal reason, therefore, for the fall in the liabilities during the year was the removal of the value of these discretionary increases from the calculation.
This reflects the nature of the scheme, whereby the employers contributions are fixed at 10.5 per cent of pensionable salary for active members and, under the trust deed, the employer cannot be required to fund any deficit, other than in accordance with legislation.
The market values of the assets and the present value of the actuarial liabilities of the defined benefit schemes at 31st March 2002 were as follows: Europe North Rest of Total America the world Funded Unfunded m m m m m Bonds 392 74 8 474 Equities 778 148 21 947 Other 35 8 43 Total market value of assets 1,205 222 37 1,464 Present value of actuarial liabilities 1,148 161 256 29 1,594 Surplus deficit 57 161 34 8 130 Less surpluses not recognised 57 57 Related deferred tax asset liability 11 2 9 Net pension liability asset 150 34 6 178 PILKINGTON DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 47 NOTES ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 39 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The analysis of the amount that would be charged to operating profit in respect of the defined benefit schemes for the year to 31st March 2003 is as follows: Europe North Rest of Total America the world Funded Unfunded m m m m m Current service cost 93 1 13 Past service cost 2 2 4 Settlement losses 2 2 Curtailment losses 1 1 Total operating charge 11 5 3 1 20 The analysis of the amount that would be charged to net interest and similar charges as other finance charge for the year to 31st March 2003 is as follows: Europe North Rest of Total America the world Funded Unfunded m m m m m Expected return on pension schemes assets 70 18 2 90 Interest on pension schemes liabilities 69 8 17 2 96 Net charge credit 1 8 1 6 The analysis of the amount that would be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL for the year to 31st March 2003 is as follows: Europe North Rest of Total America the world Funded Unfunded m m m m m Actual return less expected return on pension schemes assets 268 42 7 317 Experience gains arising on the schemes liabilities 46 4 42 Changes in the assumptions underlying the present value of the schemes liabilities 222 2 20 2 198 Total loss recognised in the STRGL 2 66 9 77 Following FRS 17 no surplus of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme would be recognised in the balance sheet, and accordingly the experience gains and losses are adjusted so that the net STRGL charge is nil.
This nil STRGL charge is a consequence of the recognised balance sheet item remaining at zero over the year and the disclosed profit and loss account charge being equal to the contributions paid.
The experience losses based on the actual movement of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme reflecting the real experience of the scheme would be 21 million.
