Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
38 Fleming Japanese Notes to the Accounts continued 17.
Financial instruments continued The main risk attached to the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates foreign currency risk.
Acceptance of these risks is a clear part of the Companys business as an investment trust and the Boards policy for managing these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Market Price Risk Market risk arises from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Boards principal control is to ensure that equity and other investments held within the portfolio are appropriately diversified across companies and industry sectors and it meets regularly to consider and monitor the position.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Foreign Currency Risk The Company has an exposure to foreign currency as part of the risk reward inherent in a company that invests overseas.
The income and capital value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as most of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified four principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: movements in rates affect the value of investments: movements in rates affect the value of loans: movements in rates affect short-term timing differences: and movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
Credit Risk The transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the shares on a purchase or cash on a sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
There is also a counterparty risk associated with deposit takers.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which have been approved by JPMFAM as an acceptable counterparty.
In addition, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any individual broker that may exist at any time.
Deposits are only placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMFAM as an acceptable counterparty.
Interest Rate Risk The Company currently borrows at floating rates of interest and can use interest rate swaps to generate both the desired interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.

3 On 8th November 2001 the Company purchased Yen 13.5 billion against sterling to close the currency hedge contract of Yen 13.5 billion against sterling for the same settlement date.
Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares or other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
Liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Company, the analysis of the Companys financial liabilities at 30th September is: 2003 2002 1 1 m m Fixed rate liabilities 22.5 Floating rate liabilities 64.7 18.3 64.7 40.8 1 These are Yen exposures which are expressed in sterling.
The floating rate liabilities bear interest at rates based on Japanese Yen Libor and comprise: Yen 6bn revolving facility with ING Bank.
Yen 6bn revolving facility borrowed from a syndicate of lenders.
Further details regarding maturity can be found in notes 9 and 10 on page 35.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet at values which represent fair values except in respect of the item disclosed below.
The fair value of the loan, which is stated after the effect of interest rate swaps, has been calculated by estimating the cost of breaking the interest rate swap.
