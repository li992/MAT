Appendix More information on special business Resolution 10: Equity Participation Plan The Company wishes to introduce an equity incentive arrangement that will encourage key executives to acquire and hold shares in the Company over the long to medium term, thus aligning their interests with shareholders.
The proposed plan would involve participants committing their own capital to buy lodge shares investment shares in the plan.
At the end of a specified period, which will normally be linked to performance, the initial shares committed by the participants will be matched by the delivery of additional free shares matching shares in the form of a nil-cost option.
The following paragraphs summarise the principal features of the plan: Employee benefit trust Investment shares will be held on behalf of participants in a specially constituted employee benefit trust EBT.
The EBT will be established and administered by an independent professional trustee company.
Eligibility At the discretion of the remuneration committee the committee, all employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries who are required to devote to their duties the whole or substantially the whole of their working time will be eligible to participate in the plan.
In practice, participation will be extended to only a limited number of senior executives.
Investment shares Participants may contribute investment shares to the plan during a prescribed invitation period, the first of which will end 3 years from the date the awards are made.
These shares will be held in the plan until the end of an additional holding period of 2 years.
Participants will retain full beneficial rights over their investment shares while they remain in the plan.
Participants may remove their investment shares from the plan at any time.
If they do so before the end of the holding period, any related awards of matching shares will immediately lapse.
The number of investment shares that a participant can contribute during any invitation period will be subject to upper and lower limits specified by the committee, provided that the upper limit may not exceed 320,000 investment shares.
Awards of matching shares The committee will make awards to participants in the form of nil cost options over matching shares.
No awards will be made to an individual who is within two years of normal retirement date.
The number of matching shares that will be made the subject of an award will be determined by the committee, but in any event may not exceed a maximum limit of two times the number of investment shares contributed to the plan by the participant.
Awards will be personal to a participant and, except on the death of a participant, may not be transferred.
Performance targets The committee will specify performance targets to be satisfied before awards of matching shares can vest in favour of participants.
The targets will be linked to the Companys earnings performance over a period of 5 financial years, the first of which will end on 31 March 2008 performance period.
Depending on the compounded percentage growth in the Companys profit before tax and amortisation PBTA over the performance period, awards of matching shares will vest and become exercisable.
Such vesting of matching shares will commence once the average per annum percentage growth in PBTA over the 5 year performance period reaches a minimum threshold growth level of 36%.
Full vesting will be achieved if the annual percentage growth in PBTA over that period reaches a maximum growth level of 43%.
For PBTA growth between such minimum and maximum levels, vesting will occur on a sliding scale basis.
Retesting will be permitted at the end of each of the subsequent 2 financial years, provided that the base point for the performance period will remain the same for all retests.
If retesting is applied, the participants will be required to retain their investment shares during the extended performance period.
GWR Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 59 Early vesting, lapse and exchange of awards In the event that a participant ceases employment before the end of the holding period the investment shares will be transferred out of the plan to the participant.
Awards of matching shares will normally lapse when a participant ceases employment.
However, if such cessation is for specified good leaver reasons, including ill-health, death, redundancy and retirement, awards may vest early at the discretion of the committee and become exercisable for a period of 6 months subject to meeting performance targets in the case of retirement.
At the discretion of the committee, such early vesting of awards will also be permitted if a participant ceases employment for any other reason.
In the event of a change of control or winding-up of the Company, investment shares will be transferred out of the plan to participants.
Additionally, early vesting of awards of matching shares will be permitted at the discretion of the committee, who will take into account the Companys performance up to the change of control, the time elapsed since the award was made, and any other factors the committee considers relevant.
Limit on equity dilution The shares required to satisfy awards of matching shares will either be issued by the Company or purchased in the market.
No award which is to be satisfied by the issue of new shares may be made on any date if the number of shares to which it relates, when aggregated with the number of shares issued or remaining issuable by virtue of awards or other rights made or granted in the preceding 10 years under the plan and any other employee share scheme adopted by the Company, would exceed 10 per cent of the issued share capital at that time.
Adjustments The number of shares comprised in any award of matching shares may be adjusted if any capitalisation issue, offer by way of rights or any sub-division, reduction, consolidation or other variation of the Companys share capital occurs.
Rights attaching to shares If shares are to be allotted and issued to a participant pursuant to the exercise of the nil cost option comprised in any award, the Company will apply for such shares to be admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority.
Such shares will rank pari passu with all other issued shares of the Company except for any rights determined by reference to a date preceding the date the nil cost option is exercised.
Amendments The committee may at any time amend the rules of the plan, provided that the prior approval of shareholders must be obtained for amendments to the material advantage of participants in respect of provisions relating to eligibility, the equity dilution limit, maximum entitlements and the basis for determining and adjusting a participants entitlement.
The prior approval of shareholders will not be required in relation to any amendment which is of a minor administrative nature, is made to comply with the provisions of any existing or proposed legislation or to maintain favourable taxation treatment of any participating company or any participant.
No amendment may be made to the plan that would adversely affect the subsisting rights of a participant unless the consent of a 75% majority of the participants to the making of such amendment is obtained.
Taxation and general To ensure compliance with the requirements for making deduction under the PAYE system, any income tax and employee Class 1 national insurance contributions or the equivalent in any foreign jurisdiction payable on gains made on the exercise of the nil cost option comprised in awards must either be paid to the relevant employing company by the participant or, alternatively, the Company may make the necessary deduction out of the net proceeds of sale of the shares acquired.
The rules of the plan also make provision for the employer Class 1 national insurance contributions arising on the exercise of nil cost options comprised in awards to be paid by the participant normally pursuant to an election made in the prescribed form if and to the extent that the committee has imposed such a requirement when making the award.
Benefits received under the plan will not be pensionable.
The rules of the proposed new equity participation plan will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company and at the offices of Osborne Clarke, Hillgate House, 26 Old Bailey, London EC4M 7HS on any weekday during normal business hours up to and including the date of the Annual General Meeting, and for a period of 15 minutes prior to the Meeting and during the Meeting.
The following two resolutions renew the directors authorities on similar terms to those granted at last years Annual General Meeting.
There is no present intention of exercising these authorities, save for the issue of shares under the Companys share option schemes: Resolution 11: Directors powers to allot share capital This resolution will allow the directors to allot up to 43,487,518 shares, subject to the statutory pre-emption rights in favour of existing shareholders, before the next Annual General Meeting.
The limitation placed on the directors authority to allot share capital under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 is the lower of one third of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company increased by share options granted but not exercised and authorised but unissued share capital.
Resolution 12: Restrictions on the Directors powers to allot share capital This resolution governs the way the shares authorised in Resolution 11 above may be allotted.
Directors may disregard the pre-emption rights which exist in favour of current shareholders in allotting up to 6,525,624 shares but otherwise any allotment of shares authorised to be issued by Resolution 11 must be on a pre-emptive basis.
The limitation on the disapplication of pre-emption rights is set at 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2003.
