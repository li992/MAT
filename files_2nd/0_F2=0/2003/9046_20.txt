Notes to the accounts Year ended 31 March 2003 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts of the group are prepared under the historical cost convention in compliance with the requirements of the Financial Services Authority, all applicable accounting standards Financial Reporting Standard FRS, Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP and Urgent Issues Task Force abstract UITF and with the Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 18.
The directors consider that the accounting policies set out below remain most appropriate to the companys circumstances, have been consistently applied, and are supported by reasonable and prudent estimates and judgements.
Basis of consolidation The accounts of the group include the results of the company, its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The results of undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the group profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Foreign currencies In the accounts of the groups companies, individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local currency at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local currency at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date, or if appropriate, at the forward exchange rate.
Profits and losses on both individual foreign currency transactions during the year and monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
On consolidation, the profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates for the year and the balance sheets at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The exchange differences arising as a result of translating profit and loss accounts at average rates and restating opening net assets at closing rates are taken to reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups equity investments in its foreign subsidiaries are taken to reserves only to the extent of the exchange differences arising on net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary is calculated using exchange rates applicable at the date of acquisition and is not subsequently re-translated at the balance sheet date.
Turnover Turnover comprises charges to customers for water and waste water services, excluding value added tax, together with the proceeds from the sale of commercial and residential properties to third parties.
Pensions The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the period benefiting from the employees services in accordance with SSAP 24.
Research and development expenditure Research and development expenditure is written off in the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on fixed assets relating to research and development projects is written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
Taxation The taxation charge in the profit and loss account is based on the profit for the year as adjusted for disallowable and non taxable items using current rates and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, subject to the following: provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets, provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
44 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated that tax will arise based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Intangible assets Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business or an associate over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which normally will not exceed 20 years.
Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
A useful economic life in excess of 20 years, or an indefinite life, is assigned to goodwill if the directors are satisfied that its durability can be demonstrated and that it is capable of continued measurement.
Goodwill with a useful economic life in excess of 20 years, or an indefinite life, is reviewed for impairment at each financial year end.
Prior to 1 April 1998, the groups policy was to charge the cost of goodwill directly to reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill originally charged against reserves remains eliminated against reserves, to the extent that it has not been charged to the profit and loss account on the disposal of the business to which it relates.
Infrastructure assets In the UK regulated water services business, infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams and sea outfalls.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets to increase capacity or enhance the network and to maintain the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service is treated as a fixed asset addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network based on an independently certified asset management plan.
Infrastructure assets in the US water services business are accounted for as for other tangible fixed assets.
Other tangible fixed assets Other tangible assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Finance costs incurred in respect of the construction of other tangible fixed assets are not capitalised.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on other tangible fixed assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual major components, from the month following commissioning.
Useful economic lives are principally as follows: Buildings 25 - 60 years Fixed plant 5 - 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 - 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leased assets Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised in tangible fixed assets and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in borrowings.
Depreciation is generally charged to the profit and loss account over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the term of the lease.
If the operational life of an asset is longer than the lease term, and the agreement allows an extension to that term, the asset may be depreciated over its operational life.
The capital element of lease payments reduces the obligation to the lessor and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
All other leases are operating leases and the rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Kelda Group plc Annual report & accounts 2003 45 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Grants and contributions Grants and contributions in respect of tangible fixed assets, other than in respect of infrastructure assets as described below, are deferred and credited to the profit and loss account by instalments over the expected economic lives of the related assets.
Grants and contributions in respect of expenditure enhancing the infrastructure network are applied in reducing that expenditure.
This is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985, which requires tangible fixed assets to be shown at cost and hence grants and contributions as deferred income.
The presentation is adopted because infrastructure assets do not have determinable finite lives and, therefore, such grants and contributions would remain as liabilities in perpetuity.
The directors consider that the groups presentation shows a true and fair view of the investment in infrastructure assets.
Grants and contributions received in respect of expenditure charged to the profit and loss account during the year are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments Investments in associated undertakings in the group accounts are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the directors consider that the group exercises significant influence over the associate.
Significant influence is generally presumed to exist where the groups effective ownership is 20% or more.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity basis where the company exercises proportionate control under a contractual arrangement.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the groups share of the operating results, interest, pre-taxation results and taxation of the associates and joint ventures for the relevant reporting period.
The consolidated balance sheet includes the groups share of the net assets of the associates and joint ventures at the balance sheet date, including any goodwill on acquisition less any provision for impairment in value.
Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Kelda Group plc shares held in an employee share ownership trust ESOT and a qualifying employee share ownership trust QUEST are carried at cost as other fixed asset investments, less any provision for impairment in accordance with UITF 17.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Stocks Stocks are stated at cost less any provision necessary to recognise damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Provisions Provision is made in accordance with FRS 12 for self insured third party liability claims incurred but not reported, and other known liabilities which exist at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Debt instruments Debt instruments are included in borrowings at the net proceeds received after the deduction of issue costs and any discount on issue.
Discounts and issue costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount.
Realised gains and losses that occur from the early termination of debt instruments are taken to profit and loss account in that period.
Forward exchange contracts Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast payments and receipts in foreign currencies.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities outstanding at the balance sheet date are re-translated at the forward exchange rate in appropriate cases.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings.
The amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis through adjustments to the interest expense of the corresponding liability.
Currency swaps Currency swaps are used to hedge exposures on foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency assets arising from fluctuations in exchange rates.
Borrowings hedged through currency swaps are shown in the groups balance sheet re-translated at the swap exchange rate.
The group uses hedge accounting in respect of its interest rate swaps only where the financial instrument does not exceed the underlying debt, the interest characteristics of the debt are altered and the contractual maturities do not exceed the maturities of the debt.
Hedge accounting is used in respect of currency swaps only where they relate to an existing asset, liability or firm commitment and move inversely in relation to the foreign currency exposures of the groups activities.

50 9 Profit attributable to parent company The profit of the parent company, after taking account of dividends from subsidiary undertakings, was 94.7m 2002: 38.6m.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption available under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present a profit and loss account for the company alone.
The parent company profit and loss account was approved by the board on 5 June 2003.

11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The ordinary shares held in the ESOT and the QUEST are excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares for this purpose.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year.

Aquarion operates in the stable US market of clean water supply in which barriers to entry are high due to significant infrastructure requirements.
In addition, Aquarion effectively has the rights to operate in its service territory in perpetuity.
Consequently, the goodwill is demonstrated to be durable and, is capable of continued measurement as defined by FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
In accordance with FRS 10 an impairment review was carried out at 31 March 2003, which showed that the carrying value of the goodwill was not more than its recoverable amount.
The subsequent acquisition by Aquarion of the New England operations of American Water Works in April 2002 gave rise to goodwill of 59.4m.
The directors are also of the opinion that this goodwill has an indefinite life.
This accounting treatment is a departure from the requirements of Paragraph 21 of Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 and is adopted in order to present a true and fair view of the groups results.
If the goodwill arising on the US acquisitions had been amortised over 20 years, the amortisation charge for the period ended 31 March 2003 would have been 10.9m and the net book amount of this goodwill at 31 March 2003 would have been 194.3m 2002: 145.8m.
Goodwill in respect of the groups other acquisitions since 1 April 1998 has been assigned a useful economic life of 20 years.
During the year 0.5m of goodwill was created as a result of the purchase of the New England water operations contract business from AquaSource Inc in the US.
Grants and contributions received relating to infrastructure assets are deducted from the cost of tangible fixed assets.
The groups accounting policy in respect of grants and contributions is a departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements and is adopted, as explained in note 1, in order to show a true and fair view of the investment in infrastructure assets.
As a consequence, the net book amount of tangible fixed assets is 241.2m lower than it would have been had this treatment not been adopted.

Long term borrowings are denominated in a number of currencies and bear interest at normal commercial rates appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is made.
During the year two new bonds were issued: 200m 5.375% bond due 2023 and 100m 3.048% index linked bond due 2033.
An additional 15 year 100m European Investment Bank facility was also drawn down.
The group also entered into interest rate swaps for notional principal amounts totalling 100m.
50m of the interest rate swaps receive interest at a rate of 12 month LIBOR and pays interest at an average rate of 4.3% with a maturity of 1 April 2004.
The remaining 50m receives interest at 6 month LIBOR and pays interest at an average rate of 4.7% with a maturity date of July 2006.

Provision has been made for all deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of accelerated capital allowances and other material timing differences.
These deferred tax assets and liabilities have been discounted to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the group, no tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future.

f Currency exposures The group may borrow in appropriate foreign currencies in order to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas.
The groups residual investments in Holland were financed by Dutch guilder or Euro borrowings in order to fully hedge against the impact of movements in the guilder and Euro sterling exchange rates on the translation of net assets denominated in Dutch guilders.
The proceeds from the Euro 625m bond issue in July 1999, used to fund the acquisition of Aquarion Company, were also predominantly swapped into sterling.
The foreign exchange exposure on the translation into sterling of the net assets of Aquarion, denominated in US dollars is principally hedged by a US dollar currency swap taken on in March 2001.
Funds of $115m to acquire five companies from American Water Works in April 2002 were borrowed in US dollars.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
There are no currency exposures on short term debtors and creditors or monetary assets and liabilities giving rise to a profit and loss account charge.
60 21 Financial instruments continued g Hedges The groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk within approved board policies and guidelines.
Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements are used to manage interest rate exposure under a policy that requires between 80% and 95% of Yorkshire Water Services Limiteds net debt and 60% and 85% of Kelda Group plcs net debt to be held at fixed rates.
At the financial year end the proportions were 99% and 79% respectively.
The proportion of Yorkshire Water Services Limiteds net debt held at fixed rates is above the target range at the year end, but is anticipated to fall to within this range during the year ending 31 March 2004.
Gains and losses on hedges are not recognised until the interest payment that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges and the movements during the year are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges At 1 April 2002 6.6 16.3 9.7 Gains and losses arising in previous years recognised during the year 8.3 3.7 4.6 Gains and losses arising in the year that were not recognised 20.0 9.3 10.7 At 31 March 2003 34.9 29.3 5.6 of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised during the year ending 31 March 2004 11.6 6.9 4.7 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in later years 23.3 22.4 0.9 Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges At 1 April 2001 8.1 18.3 10.2 Gains and losses arising in previous years recognised during the year 1.1 6.1 5.0 Gains and losses arising in the year that were not recognised 0.4 4.1 4.5 At 31 March 2002 6.6 16.3 9.7 of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised during the year ended 31 March 2003 1.8 3.5 1.7 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in later years 4.8 12.8 8.0 The table excludes the fair value of currency swaps maturing in 2005 and 2006 amounting to 21.9m 2002: 28.9 m which is recognised in the book value of long term borrowings at 31 March 2003. h Financial instruments held for trading purposes The group does not trade in financial instruments.

The group has both an ESOT and a QUEST, which are trusts used to administer the issue of shares to employees and directors under the companys Sharesave save-as-you-earn share option scheme and, in the case of the ESOT, the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The QUEST, like the ESOT, is a trust funded by interest free loans from the company.
All the administration costs of the trusts are written off to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
The shares held by the trusts are included as fixed assets investments in note 14.
In accordance with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales technical release 7 03 issued in March 2003, 231.3m of the company profit and loss account reserves are classified as non-distributable.

In addition Massachusetts Capital Resource Company, which owns and leases certain assets to  Water Company was also acquired.
The consideration was $120m in cash and the assumption of debt of $104m.
The book values of the assets and liabilities of the acquired companies has been adjusted by 27.3m in order to reflect their fair values and ensure compliance with the groups stated accounting policies.
The acquired companies contributed turnover of 29.5m and operating profit of 10.5m in the period from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2003.
The acquired companies contributed 10.3m to the groups net operating cash flows, paid 4.4m in respect of interest, utilised 5.5m in respect of capital expenditure and repaid long term debt of 12.4m.

The significant fair value adjustments are: 1 The book value of the pension scheme deficit of the acquired companies has been adjusted to reflect its fair value in accordance with FRS 7 Fair value in acquisition accounting.
Provision was also made for existing environmental liabilities.
2 The deferred taxation liability in the acquisition balance sheets of the acquired companies is calculated using the undiscounted full provision method in accordance with US accounting standards.
The fair value adjustment in respect of deferred taxation has been calculated in accordance with the requirements of both FRS 7 and FRS 19, which allows discounting of the full provision.
3 An adjustment has been made to reflect the market value of the loans acquired.
64 27 Contingent liabilities The parent company has guaranteed certain subsidiary undertakings borrowings of 745.8m 2002: 661.1m.
At the time of completion of the WRG merger, an indemnity was given to WRG by Yorkshire Environmental Solutions Limited, backed by a Kelda Group plc guarantee, in respect of a landfill site managed by 3C Waste Limited and known as the Rhonda site.
The indemnity is unlimited in amount and the time limit for bringing claims is seven years from 26 January 1999, except for personal injury claims where the limit is 15 years.
The matters covered under this indemnity are any losses arising out of: a non compliance with an Environment Agency notice served in May 1998: b any claims by individuals for personal injury, harm to health, nuisance etc: c liability for negligent performance of the contract between 3C Waste Limited and Rhonda Waste Disposal Limited.
28 Pensions UK pension scheme The group sponsors a UK pension scheme, called the Kelda Group Pension Plan KGPP.
The KGPP has a number of benefit categories providing benefits on a defined benefit basis and one category providing benefits on a defined contribution basis.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the KGPP was carried out as at 31 March 2001 when the market value of assets was 559.9m and the scheme surplus 22.2m.
The UK pension cost under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs for KGPP has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, using the projected unit method.
For this purpose, the actuarial assumptions adopted are based upon investment growth of 5.4% per annum, pay growth of 4% per annum and increases to pensions in payment and deferred pensions of 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the assets represented 107.5% of the value of the accrued benefits after allowing for expected future earnings increases.
In deriving the pension costs under SSAP 24, the surplus is being spread over the future working lifetime of the employees.
Contributions over the year ended 31 March 2003 were paid by members at 3%, 4%, 4.5%, 5% or 6% of pensionable pay depending on benefit category.
The company contributed at 200% of members contributions during the accounting year in respect of the majority of members.
An accrual for unfunded benefits of 1.8m 2002: 1.6m has been included in the groups accounts at 31 March 2003.
US pension schemes Aquarion in the US operates a number of non contributory defined benefit retirement plans.
The two principal retirement plans relate to Aquarion Company acquired in 2000 and employees of the American Water Works companies acquired in April 2002.
Aquarion also provides healthcare benefits for certain categories of employees.
The latest valuations of the US schemes were carried out at 31 December 2002.
The market value of assets of the principal retirement plans was $56.3m and exceeded the benefit obligations including those acquired during the year at that date by $3.5m.
The benefit obligation of the post retirement healthcare plans exceeded the market value of assets by $19.7m.
The Aquarion pension assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value on acquisition and full provision for the post retirement healthcare benefit obligations has been made in the groups accounts at 31 March 2003.
The groups total pension charge for the year was 11.2m 2002: 9.0m.
Kelda Group plc Annual report & accounts 2003 65 Notes to the accounts 28 Pensions continued The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 are set out below.
A qualified independent actuary has updated the most recent valuations of the principal schemes to 31 March 2003.
In calculating the liabilities at 31 March 2003, the following financial assumptions have been used: 2003 2003 2002 2002 UK US UK US Major assumptions %% % % Inflation 2.5 2.8 Rate of increase in salaries 3.7 4.0 4.3 5.0 Rate of increase to pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.5 2.8 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.4 6.3 6.0 7.3 The Aquarion retirement plan does not guarantee to increase pensions in payment and there is no pre-funding of pensions increases.
Discretionary increases have been awarded in the past on an ad hoc basis.
The rate of increase in healthcare costs in the US varies by year of projection with an ultimate rate of 5% from 2010.
The market values of the assets and the FRS 17 value of liabilities of KGPP and the principal US defined benefit plans at 31 March 2003, together with the expected long term rate of returns were as follows: 2003 UK US Expected long Expected long Market term rate of Market term rate of value return value return m % m % Market value of assets Equities 314.7 7.25 20.0 7.75 Bonds 69.8 4.90 16.9 6.30 Other 22.6 4.50 3.3 5.00 407.1 40.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 566.9 57.4 Pension deficit before deferred tax 159.8 17.2 Deferred tax 47.9 6.9 Net pension deficit 111.9 10.3 2002 UK US Expected long Expected long Market term rate of Market term rate of value return value return m % m % Market value of assets Equities 431.8 6.75 21.1 8.0 Bonds 81.9 5.70 11.2 7.3 Other 26.5 5.25 7.2 6.0 540.2 39.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 515.0 36.7 Pension asset before deferred tax 25.2 2.8 Deferred tax 7.6 1.1 Net pension asset 17.6 1.7 FRS 17 requires that the pension schemes are valued using market conditions at the companys year end.
This produces a volatile figure for any surplus or deficit as it is largely dependent on the levels of stock markets on one particular date.
The groups pension liabilities are funded on a long term basis based on the periodic actuarial reviews rather than the FRS 17 disclosures.
