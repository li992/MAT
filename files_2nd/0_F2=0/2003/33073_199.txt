From 1 January 2000, Unilever adopted the euro as its principal reporting currency.
The effect of exchange uctuations over time means that the trends shown may differ signicantly from those previously shown in sterling and from those which would arise if these euro amounts had been translated from the historical sterling accounts.
Following the changes in accounting policies for share-based payments and for the presentation of securities received as collateral, the consolidated profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and cash ow statements in respect of prior years have been restated.
The adoption of UK Financial Reporting Standard 17 on pensions accounting has been reected by restating the consolidated profit and loss accounts for the years ended and the balance sheets as at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001.
As allowed by the transitional provisions of FRS 17, the financial statements in respect of earlier years have not been restated for this change in accounting policy.
