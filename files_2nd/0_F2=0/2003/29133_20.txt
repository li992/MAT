x NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out in paragraphs a to h below.
All have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year.
a BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies.
b INVESTMENTS Listed investments are shown at middle market value, or in the case of FTSE 100 constituents, at last traded prices issued by the London Stock Exchange.
Listed investments include Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs authorised in the UK: these are valued at mid price and are classified for valuation purposes according to the principal geographical area of the underlying holdings.
Unlisted investments are shown at a valuation determined by the Directors based upon latest dealing prices, stockbroker valuations, net asset values and other information, as appropriate.
c INCOME i Income from equity investments is brought into account on the date on which the investments are quoted ex-dividend or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
ii Interest from fixed interest securities is recognised on an accruals basis.
Fixed interest securities issued at a significant discount or premium are accounted for on an effective yield basis.
iii Franked income is stated net of tax credits.
iv Unfranked investment income includes the taxes deducted at source.
v Interest receivable on deposits is recognised on an accruals basis.
vi If scrip is taken in lieu of dividends in cash, the net amount of the cash dividend declared is credited to the revenue account.
d EXPENSES All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: where they relate directly to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case they are added to the cost of the investment or deducted from the sale proceeds and where they are connected with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments, in which case they are charged 50:50 to the revenue account and realised capital reserve.
e LONG TERM BORROWINGS AND FINANCE COSTS Long term borrowings are carried in the balance sheet at the cumulative amount of net proceeds after issue, plus accrued finance costs.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated 50:50 to the revenue account and realised capital reserve at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Issue costs are written off at a constant rate over the life of the borrowings.
f TAXATION Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, calculated at the current tax rate relevant to the benefit or liability.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it will be more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which underlying timing differences can be deducted.
g FOREIGN CURRENCIES Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the time of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in capital reserve or revenue reserve as appropriate.
h CAPITAL RESERVES Realised: Gains and losses on realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are dealt with in this reserve.
Purchases of the Companys own shares for cancellation are also funded from this reserve.
50% of management fees, including related VAT, and finance costs are allocated to the realised capital reserve in accordance with the Companys objective of combining capital and income growth.
Unrealised: Unrealised appreciation represents the amount by which the market value of assets and liabilities differs from their book value and is dealt with in this reserve.

The management fee is levied on all assets, including holdings in collective investment schemes OEICs managed by Baillie Gifford & Co: however the OEICs share class held by the Company does not attract a management fee.

There is no corporation tax charge at 31 March 2003 or 31 March 2002 as the Company has unrelieved management expenses which are available to be carried forward.
The tax charge for 31 March 2003 and 2002 comprises overseas withholding taxes written off.
At 31 March 2003 the Company had surplus management expenses of 24 million 2002 18 million which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.

Deducting prior charges at market value would have the effect of reducing net asset value per share from 285.5p to 268.0p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2003 of 234.5p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 12.5% as against 17.9% on a traditional basis.
At 31 March 2002 the effect would be to reduce net asset value from 423.6p to 409.4p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2002 of 369.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 9.9% as against 12.9%.
Gains and losses on hedges At 31 March 2003 there were no unrecognised gains losses on hedges.
Realised currency gains losses are taken to the capital reserve and are not reflected in the revenue account unless they are of a revenue nature.

24 SUMMARY OF MAIN INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS as incorporated within the investment management agreement between the Company and Baillie Gifford & Co Holding size At the time of investment, a maximum of 8% of total assets may be invested in any one holding.
This restriction does not apply to investment in collective investment schemes, issues by way of rights or certain government bonds.
A maximum of 40% of total assets may be invested in holdings exceeding 3% of the value of the Companys total assets.
Again, this restriction does not apply to collective investment schemes, issues by way of rights or certain government bonds.
Categories of investment No investment shall be made on which there is unlimited liability.
The Managers must seek permission of the Board to invest in collective investment schemes managed by Baillie Gifford & Co.
Transactions in futures and options must be consistent with Inland Revenue guidelines so as to ensure maintenance of the Companys Investment Trust status.
25 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company operates as an investment trust company in accordance with S842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The international nature of the Companys investment activities provides opportunities for both market appreciation and currency gains, but leaves it exposed to the risk of market volatility and currency fluctuations.
In the case of an investment trust, capital profits from investing activities and currency gains are not recognised in the revenue account, but are credited directly to a separate capital reserve which the Company is prohibited from distributing in the form of dividends.
The Company makes use of gearing long and short term borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The Companys revenue account may be affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates: income from overseas investment can be affected by currency fluctuations.
The Companys financial instruments, which provide finance for investment activities, comprise its debenture stocks, its long and short term borrowings, and its cash and liquid resources.
In addition to the equity portfolio, the Company maintains investments in UK and overseas corporate bonds as part of its investment strategy.
The Company may, from time to time, enter into derivative transactions to hedge specific currency or interest rate risk.
No such transactions were undertaken in the period under review.
The Company has precisely defined guidelines to govern the purchase or writing of options on individual shares.
No options were purchased or written in the year under review.
Trading in financial instruments is not within the normal activities of an investment trust, nor is it the Companys policy to trade in such instruments.
Transactions in financial instruments generally arise as a result of strategic investment decisions.
The Companys Managers may not enter into derivative transactions without the prior approval of the Board, and all borrowing facilities require Board authorisation.
The Board agrees policies for managing risk with the Companys Managers.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market risk as noted above, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its operations by means of realised capital profits, retained revenue reserves, bank borrowings and the issue of debenture stocks.
The value of the Companys bond portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk.
The Company has negotiated short term multi-currency borrowing facilities at interest rates linked to LIBOR and may draw down funds for a period of up to 12 months.
The Company has issued a mix of stepped and fixed interest debenture stocks.
The stepped interest debenture stocks have reached their final step and are deemed to be fixed.
Credit Risk In addition to interest rate risk, the Companys investments in bonds are also subject to credit risk.
Credit risk reflects the possibility that a borrower will not be able to meet its obligation to make payments of interest or principal when they fall due.
The Managers analyse the credit risk of the Companys bond investments prior to purchase and continue to monitor developments in credit quality subsequently.
Liquidity Risk The Companys policy with regard to liquidity is to ensure continuity of funding.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Foreign Currency Risk The international nature of the Companys investment activities gives rise to a currency risk which is inherent in the performance of its overseas investments.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis, but the Company may from time to time match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
