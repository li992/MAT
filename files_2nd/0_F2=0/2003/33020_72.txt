They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan which rewards good performance at corporate, function business and individual team levels.
Depending upon performance and upon which level it is measured, bonuses may be paid partly in the form of Ordinary Shares in the Company under the Inland Revenue approved AstraZeneca All-Employee Share Plan and up to a maximum annual value of 3,000 and partly in cash.
A tax efficient share retention scheme, under which employees leave their bonus shares in trust for three to five years, forms part of the All-Employee Share Plan.

The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12 month period.
A tax efficient share retention scheme is also available in respect of Partnership Shares.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.

The last date for the grant of options was 19 May 1994 and the scheme was replaced by the Zeneca 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary Shares.
All remaining options will lapse in April 2004 if not exercised before then.

All options granted under the 1994 scheme have become exercisable, the performance conditions having been satisfied.
3 Summary of the Astra Shareholder Value Incentive Plan In 1996, Astra established a stock option plan for some 100 Astra employees in key senior positions.

On completion of the merger with Zeneca, options in Astra shares granted under the plan were replaced by options to acquire a number of AstraZeneca Ordinary Shares based on the exchange ratio used in the exchange offers used to effect the AstraZeneca merger.
The ratio of AstraZeneca options granted in respect of former Astra options was 0.5045 AstraZeneca options for each Astra option held.
