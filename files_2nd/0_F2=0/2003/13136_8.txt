The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The two largest schemes, which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK and US.
The main UK scheme was subject to a triennial valuation by Watson Wyatt Partners as at 5 April 2003.
The main US scheme is valued annually and was subject to a valuation by Towers Perrin as at 1 January 2003.
The principal valuation assumptions for the main UK scheme were: Actuarial method Projected unit method Annual rate of return on investments 6.8% Annual increase in total pensionable remuneration 4.5% Annual increase in present and future pensions in payment 2.5% The principal valuation assumptions used for the US scheme were a rate of return on investments of 7.75%, increase in pensionable remuneration of 4.5%, and increase in present and future pensions in payment of 3.0%, applied under the projected unit method.
The actuarial values placed on scheme assets under SSAP24 as at their last valuation date were sufficient to cover 113% and 104% of the benefits that had accrued to members of the main UK and US schemes, respectively.
Actuarial surpluses are spread as a level amount over the average remaining service lives of employees.
The actuarial values of the schemes assets as at the valuation dates, excluding assets held in respect of members additional voluntary contributions, were 1,350m 1,958m and 260m 369m in respect of the UK and US schemes respectively.
Assessments for accounting purposes in respect of other funded schemes, including the Netherlands scheme, have been carried out by external qualified actuaries using prospective benefit methods.
The actuarial value of assets of the schemes approximated to the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration and pensions in course of payment.
The assets of the Netherlands scheme as at 31 December 2003 were sufficient to cover 101% of the actuarial value placed on the benefits that had accrued to the members of the scheme as at that date.
The liabilities in respect of unfunded schemes have been determined by actuaries.
As at 31 December 2003 52m 74m 2002: 52m 80m has been provided for within creditors.
REED ELSEVIER ANNUAL REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2003 49 COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4 Pension schemes continued The net pension charge was 59m 86m 2002: 59m 94m.
Pension contributions made in the year amounted to 49m 72m 2002: 47m 75m.
The net SSAP24 charge on the main UK scheme comprises a regular cost of 23m 33m 2002: 27m 43m, less amortisation of the net actuarial surplus of 13m 19m 2002: 24m 38m.
Based on the advice of the scheme actuaries, and with the agreement of the scheme trustees, no employer contributions have been made to the main UK scheme in 2003 2002: nil and, with effect from 1 January 2004, employer contributions will be made at a rate of 5% of pensionable salaries until the next triennial valuation in 2006.
A prepayment of 115m 163m 2002: 125m 191m is included in debtors falling due after more than one year, representing the excess of the net pension credit to the profit and loss account since 1988 over the amounts funded to the main UK scheme.
Pension costs are accounted for in accordance with the UK accounting standard, SSAP24.
A new UK financial reporting standard, FRS17: Retirement Benefits requires additional information to be disclosed based on methodologies set out in the standard which are different from those used under SSAP24 and by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
The assumed rates of return on scheme assets, the fair value of those assets and the present value of the scheme liabilities based on the methodologies and presentation prescribed by FRS17 were as follows: Main UK Scheme Aggregate of Schemes Assumed rate of Assumed rate of return on assets m m return on assets m m 2003 Equities 7.8% 1,050 1,491 8.0% 1,341 1,904 Bonds 4.8% 442 628 5.0% 639 907 Other 4.3% 38 54 4.6% 50 72 Total fair value of assets 1,530 2,173 2,030 2,883 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,588 2,255 2,281 3,239 Net deficit 58 82 251 356 Related deferred tax 17 24 84 119 Net pension liability 41 58 167 237 Main UK Scheme Aggregate of Schemes Assumed rate of Assumed rate of return on assets m m return on assets m m 2002 Equities 9.0% 825 1,262 9.0% 1,068 1,634 Bonds 4.5% 487 745 4.9% 670 1,025 Other 3.8% 45 69 3.8% 53 81 Total fair value of assets 1,357 2,076 1,791 2,740 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,305 1,996 1,928 2,950 Net surplus deficit 52 80 137 210 Related deferred tax 16 25 50 77 Net pension asset liability 36 55 87 133 At 31 December 2003, the aggregate net deficit in respect of the defined benefit schemes under FRS17 comprised 189m 268m 2002: 66m 101m in respect of funded schemes and liabilities of 62m 88m 2002: 71m 109m in respect of unfunded schemes, of which 52m 74m 2002: 52m 80m is provided for within creditors under SSAP24.
At 31 December 2001, for the aggregate of schemes, the fair value of equities, bonds and assets, and the related assumed rates of return for those asset classes were 1,267m 2,078m, 721m 1,182m and 81m 133m and 7.7%, 5.5% and 4.0% respectively.

REED ELSEVIER ANNUAL REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2003 57 COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12 Acquisitions During the year a number of acquisitions were made for a total consideration amounting to 226m 328m, including 3m 5m deferred to future years, and after taking account of net cash acquired of 9m 13m.
The most significant acquisitions were the Holtzbrinck STM business in Germany, and, in the US, Applied Discovery Inc and the public records business of Dolan Media Company.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
The fair values of the consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below: Book value Fair value Fair on acquisition adjustments value m m m Goodwill 93 93 Intangible fixed assets 28 108 136 Tangible fixed assets 4 1 3 Current assets 44 44 Current liabilities 42 1 41 Borrowings 9 9 Net assets acquired 25 201 226 Consideration after taking account of 9m net cash acquired 226 Less: deferred to future years 3 Net cash flow 223 Book value Fair value Fair on acquisition adjustments value m m m Goodwill 135 135 Intangible fixed assets 41 156 197 Tangible fixed assets 6 2 4 Current assets 64 64 Current liabilities 62 3 59 Borrowings 13 13 Net assets acquired 36 292 328 Consideration after taking account of 13m net cash acquired 328 Less: deferred to future years 5 Net cash flow 323 The fair value adjustments in relation to the acquisitions made in 2003 relate principally to the valuation of intangible assets to conform with Reed Elsevier accounting policies.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
The businesses acquired in 2003 contributed 80m 116m to turnover, 16m 25m to adjusted operating profit, before the amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items, and 15m 22m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership.
