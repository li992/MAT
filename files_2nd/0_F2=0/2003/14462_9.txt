Notes to the Financial Statements At 26 April 2003 1.
Accounting policies Accounting convention and basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, adjusted for the revaluation of certain land and buildings, and comply with all applicable accounting and financial reporting standards.
The Group has taken advantage of transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Group financial statements The Group financial statements consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary companies are consolidated from the date that control passes.
Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses when the consideration exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising prior to 25 April 1998 has been taken directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 25 April 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Turnover Turnover represents external sales of goods and services during the period, net of value added tax.
Where promotional activity is undertaken the free sale element is excluded from turnover.
Group turnover includes sales made by retail partners when scanned through the Groups tills.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents all costs incurred to the point of sale, including warehousing, distribution, direct marketing and store operating costs.
Fixed assets Fixed assets are stated at cost, or valuation, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates which reduce the costs of assets to their estimated residual value at the end of their economic useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings Over 40 years Short leasehold interests in property unexpired lease term less than 50 years Over term of lease Plant, equipment, fixtures, fittings and vehicles Over 2 to 20 years Freehold land is not depreciated Rates of depreciation are reviewed regularly in the light of experience.
The Group reviews the carrying value of its properties regularly and in any event when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
This includes a regular review of property for potential impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill and when deemed appropriate property values are written down.
Capitalised interest Interest incurred on borrowings to finance specific property developments is capitalised, gross of the related tax credit, until completion of the project.
Pensions The Group operates two pension schemes.
The Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme has a closed defined benefits section and a defined contribution section.
The Kwik Save Group plc Lump Sum Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme is a closed defined benefits scheme.
For defined benefits, contributions to the schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the working lives of Group employees.
Variations in pension cost, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees who are scheme members.
Defined contributions are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis as they become payable.
Closed property costs Closed property costs represent amounts in respect of properties which no longer form part of the store trading portfolio.
Provisions are charged to operating profits, and recorded within provisions for liabilities and charges when properties become vacant.
The provision charged represents the best estimate of unavoidable future costs, having taken into account the time value of money.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost represents invoiced cost or selling price less the relevant profit margin to reduce it to estimated cost, including an appropriate element of overheads.
Stock at warehouses is valued at weighted average cost and at stores on a first-in first-out basis.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Leasing commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors net of finance charges.
Interest costs on finance leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Financial instruments Derivative instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Premia on interest rate cap agreements are amortised over the life of the agreement.
Gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction is settled.

In particular, a number of open items, previously under discussion, have been agreed with the Inland Revenue resulting in revision of the earlier years tax computations.
Factors affecting the tax credit for the period The tax assessed for the period can be reconciled to the expected tax charge as follows: 2002 2003 2001 2002 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 34.8 22.2 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of 30% 10.4 6.7 The effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.6 0.6 Accounting depreciation not deductible for tax purposes 4.3 3.5 Release of impairment not deductible for tax purposes 2.2 Profit on disposal covered by capital losses 8.4 2.4 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 12.7 7.1 Movement in short term timing differences 1.0 Increase in tax losses 4.8 0.9 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior periods 5.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group has not recognised a net deferred tax asset on the basis that the likelihood of utilising the economic benefit of the asset in subsequent accounting periods is not certain.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing properties to their market value.
Any taxable gains would be set against capital losses carried forward, which are currently 219 million.

Dividends 2002 2003 2001 2002 m m Interim dividend paid of 0.4p per share 2001 02: nil 1.9 Final dividend proposed of 1.25p per share 2001 2002 1.0p 6.1 4.9 8.0 4.9 Both the Companys Employee Share Ownership Plan the ESOP and the Companys Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust the QUEST have waived the dividends payable on the shares that they own.
See note 11 b for further details on these shares.
Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based upon the profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 39.8 million 52 weeks to 27 April 2002 profit of 28.2 million divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period of 485.6 million 52 weeks to 27 April 2002 485.2 million.
Underlying earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, have been calculated in order to allow shareholders to assess the underlying results of the business.
This underlying earnings per share measure is based on the same number of shares in issue as the basic calculation and the profit on ordinary activities after taxation, but excluding exceptional items and amounts written back to investments, and amounts to a profit of 30.8 million 52 weeks to 27 April 2002 profit of 26.8 million.
In accordance with FRS 14 Earnings per Share, diluted earnings per share have been disclosed.
The diluted earnings per share are based upon the profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 39.8 million 52 weeks to 27 April 2002 profit of 28.2 million.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance based options where the performance condition has been met.
The calculation compares the difference between the exercise price of exercisable share options, weighted for the period over which they were outstanding, with the average daily mid-market closing price over the period.
The resulting total number of shares on which diluted earnings per share have been calculated is as follows: 2002 2003 2001 2002 Million Million Basic weighted average number of shares in issue in the period 485.6 485.2 Weighted average number of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Employee share options 4.6 8.2 Total number of shares for calculating diluted earnings per share 490.2 493.4 26 Somerfield plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 2003 10.

Pensions The Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme comprises defined benefit sections for employees who were members of either the Kwik Save Retirement Benefits Scheme or the Somerfield Pension Scheme prior to September 1999 and a defined contribution section for all other members.
The Group also operates a separate closed defined benefit scheme providing lump sum retirement and death benefits for some Kwik Save employees.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The Groups contributions to the defined benefit sections of the Scheme are determined taking into account the advice of the Schemes independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2001.
The most significant actuarial assumptions were that future investment returns would be 6.3% pa, future salary and wage increases would be 3.4% pa, pensions subject to LPI increases in payment ie in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% pa would increase at 2.4% pa and pensions subject to LPI increases in payment with a minimum of 3% pa would increase at 3.5% pa. As at 6 April 2001 the market value of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Schemes assets was 293 million and these assets represented 99% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members allowing for future salary increases for active members.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Kwik Save Lump Sum Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2000.
The most significant financial assumptions were that future investment returns would be 5.7% pa and that future salary and wage increases would be 3.7% pa.
This valuation showed that the assets of the Scheme represented 159% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members allowing for future salary increases for active members.
In both cases any excess or shortfall of assets over liabilities is being eliminated over the average remaining working lives of employees who are scheme members.
Any difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the pension schemes is included as an asset or liability.
The total pension cost for the period including the defined contribution section was 2.5 million 2001 02 2.9 million.
This reflected a regular cost of 7.3 million and a credit of 4.8 million in respect of the amortisation of the combined excess of assets over liabilities.
A further 0.8 million represents contributions made to personal pension arrangements and unapproved pension schemes relating to directors, past and present, and other senior employees.

FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will not be mandatory for the Group until the year ended April 2006, however the following transitional disclosures are required.
The valuations of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme and the Kwik Save Lump Sum Scheme were carried out as at 6 April 2001 and 5 April 2000 respectively.
An independent qualified actuary has updated these to 26 April 2003.
