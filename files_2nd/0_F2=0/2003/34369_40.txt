Purchase of Own Shares During the year the company purchased 30,320,954 shares, with a nominal value of 7,580,238.
The aggregate consideration for these purchases was 130,112,824.26.
These shares, representing 5.8% of the total share capital at the start of the year have subsequently been cancelled, except for 900,000 which were cancelled shortly after the year end.
Accordingly the exercise of this linked option over a number of shares automatically causes its counterpart to lapse in respect of the same number of shares: therefore this option does not increase the total number of shares under option.
The total in the table reflects the number of shares under option.
