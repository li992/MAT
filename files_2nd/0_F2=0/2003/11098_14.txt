NEXT PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Basis of accounting The current holding company was incorporated on 9 April 2002.
On 22 November 2002 it acquired 100% of the issued share capital of NEXT plc following implementation of a Scheme of Arrangement under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Scheme of Arrangement involved the issue of one new share in the current holding company for one existing share in NEXT plc.
This group reconstruction has been accounted for using merger accounting principles since the new shareholders of the Company are the same as the former shareholders and the rights of each shareholder, relative to the others, are unchanged.
The consolidated accounts are presented as if the Scheme of Arrangement had been effective on 27 January 2002 except for the effect of the capital restructure and subsequent reduction of capital which took place on 22 November 2002.
The consolidated profit and loss account combines the results of the Group for the 53 week period ended 1 February 2003 with those of the current holding company for the period since its incorporation to 1 February 2003.
Further details of the Scheme of Arrangement can be found in Note 21 to the accounts.

The analysis of turnover and operating profit by geographical origin is not significantly different from the analysis by destination disclosed above.

Fair values have been determined using market quoted rates at the year end date and, where appropriate, cashflows have been discounted to present value using prevailing market interest rates.
The Group does not recognise any accrued but unrealised gains or losses on currency or interest rate instruments until the relevant contract is concluded.
Save for 0.6m of unrealised net gains on contracts due to mature after January 2004, all of the unrealised net losses of 21.8m at 1 February 2003 on currency and interest rate instruments are expected to be dealt with in the profit and loss account for the year to January 2004.
6.6m of the unrealised net gains of 6.9m at 26 January 2002 on currency and interest rate instruments were dealt with in the profit and loss account for the year to January 2003.

The defined benefit section is a funded arrangement which provides benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries, overtime and annual performance bonuses and was closed to new members on 30 September 2000.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined on or after 1 October 2000 and benefits are based on each individual members personal account.
The scheme has equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The Group continues to report its pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was undertaken by an independent professionally qualified actuary as at 31 March 2002 using the projected unit method.
The principal financial assumptions which have the most significant effect on the computation of the pension costs are those related to the rate of return on the investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pensions.
These assumptions have been derived from market yields applying at the valuation date.
In particular, the investment return used relating to pre-retirement liabilities was two and three quarters percentage points per annum in excess of the assumed rate of increase in earnings and the investment return used relating to post-retirement liabilities was three percentage points per annum in excess of the assumed rate of pension increases.
Demographic assumptions have also been taken into account, in particular the general trend in mortality experience.
At 31 March 2002, the market value of the assets of the defined benefit section was 204m representing 98% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
No surplus has been recognised in the year 2002: 1.7m.
The regular pension cost amounted to 9.8m 2002: 10.4m.
From 1 April 2002 the Group increased employer contributions to the scheme from 10% to 12.3% and will increase them further to 12.5% with effect from 1 February 2003.
Employer contributions of 12.7m 2002: 7.4m were made in the year including a 2.5m contribution in respect of the deficit on the defined benefit section as at 31 March 2002 and contributions of 0.7m 2002: 0.3m in respect of the defined contribution section.
The pension costs for the Group will continue to be set at a level that takes account of the past service funding position of the scheme.
Full pension costs of the Group amounted to 11.2m 2002: 10.0m including the estimated cost of meeting unfunded unapproved pension liabilities relating to scheme members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Inland Revenue salary cap.
There is a pension accrual in the balance sheet of 19.1m 2002: 20.1m.
A further payment of 2.5m has been made since the year end as a contribution in respect of the defined benefit section deficit and the Board will keep the need for any further such payments under review.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The pension costs shown in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard, SSAP 24.
The new pension cost accounting standard, FRS 17, is applicable for year ending January 2006 and subsequent years.
Under transitional arrangements the Company is required to disclose the following information about the scheme and the treatment that would have been shown under FRS 17 in the accounts for the year ended 1 February 2003.
The information required for disclosure in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits is based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2002 and updated to 1 February 2003 in order to assess the liabilities of the defined benefit section including the unfunded, unapproved arrangement at that date.
