Notes to the financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements, with the exception of the adoption of UITF 34 Pre-contract costs.
UITF 34 Pre-contract costs was adopted during the year.
Pre-contract costs are now expensed as incurred, rather than the previous policy of capitalisation.
The impact of this change in accounting policy for the year to 31 March 2003 is an increase in exceptional costs of 0.8m and for the year to 31 March 2002 an increase in exceptional costs of 1.6m.
The restatement of bid costs at 31 March 2002 has resulted in a reduction of 1.9m in other debtors and prepayments, an increase of 0.4m in accruals and deferred income, and a reduction in equity shareholders funds of 2.3m to 419.0m.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modied to include the revaluation of certain xed assets, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings: all accounts are made up to 31 March 2003.
The results of subsidiary undertakings are included in the financial statements under the principles of FRS 6 from the date control passes.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment, held for the long term, over which it exercises significant inuence are treated as associates.
Undertakings in which the Group has an investment that is held for the long term and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures.
The Groups share of profits and losses of associates and joint ventures are included in the consolidated profit and loss account, and the Groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet, based on the latest available accounts for these undertakings.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
In the accounts of the Company, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the profit and loss account to the extent that they represent a realised profit for the Company.
c Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 April 1998 is shown on the balance sheet as an intangible xed asset.
Where capitalised goodwill is regarded as having a limited useful economic life, it is amortised over that life.
Where capitalised goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite useful economic life, it is not amortised.
Where capitalised goodwill is amortised over a life of greater than 20 years, or is not amortised, annual impairment reviews are conducted to compare the book value with the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount has fallen below the book value, the goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount immediately.
The Companies Act 1985 normally requires goodwill that is treated as an asset to be amortised systematically over a nite period.
In order to show a true and fair view of the Groups results, goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Mainline and Capital Citybus is not being amortised because of a number of factors that mean that the goodwill has an indefinite life.
These include the stability of the bus industry, its lack of fundamental change and the Groups track record in maintaining and enhancing the values of its businesses.
This treatment of goodwill as having an indefinite life is in accordance with FRS 10.
It is not possible to quantify the effect on the Groups results if the Act were to be followed, as it would depend on the nite life that was used.
Capitalised goodwill arising on other acquisitions is being amortised over a period of up to 20 years on a straight line basis.
Capitalised goodwill arising on foreign acquisitions is denominated in the currency in which the acquired companys assets and liabilities are recorded.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
In the year of acquisition, some adjustments are made using provisional estimates, based on information available at the time the financial statements are prepared, and amendments are sometimes necessary in the following accounting period, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, when the information necessary to determine these estimates is available.
Prior to 1 April 1998, all goodwill arising on acquisitions was written off to reserves.
This goodwill has not been reinstated on the balance sheet.
On disposal of the businesses concerned this goodwill is included in determining the gain or loss on disposal in the profit and loss account.
d Turnover Turnover represents the amounts receivable for services supplied to customers during the year and includes rail support grants and amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes.
34 34 34 F F FIRST IRST IRST 1 Principal accounting policies continued e Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less residual value of tangible xed assets over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 15 years straight line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight line No depreciation is provided on freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in course of construction.
Surpluses or deficits arising on the revaluation of tangible xed assets are credited or debited to a revaluation reserve.
On a subsequent disposal of a revalued asset, the revaluation surplus or deficit relating to this asset is transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
From 1 April 1999 the Groups policy has been not to revalue tangible xed assets.
Properties that had been revalued before that date retained their book value, in accordance with the transitional rules of FRS 15. f Hire purchase contracts and leases Assets held under hire purchase contracts and under finance leases, which are those leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group are recorded in the balance sheet as tangible xed assets.
Depreciation is provided on these assets over their estimated useful lives or lease term, as appropriate.
Future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are included in creditors, net of finance charges.
Payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account as interest, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligations.
The finance charges are calculated in relation to the reducing amount of obligations outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental charges are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
g Government grants and subsidies Rail support grants and amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included in turnover and are recognised in the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
h Stocks and work in progress Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
i Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year end and results of foreign enterprises are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Differences on exchange arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign enterprises and from the translation of results at an average rate are taken to reserves.
Where foreign currency borrowings are used to finance or hedge investments in foreign enterprises, the gain or loss on translation is also taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
j Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Provision is made for deferred tax on all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of xed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell or on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
k Pension costs Retirement benets are provided for most employees of the Group by means of dened benefit pension schemes.
These are funded by contributions from the Group and employees.
The Groups contributions are charged to the profit and loss account, based on recommendations by independent actuaries, in such a way as to provide for the liabilities evenly over the average remaining working lives of the employees.
The difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid by the Group is shown as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet and the tax effect of this timing difference is included in deferred taxation.
FIRST 35 Notes to the financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued l Financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate and forward exchange contracts.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk prole of an existing underlying exposure of the Group, in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps and caps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
m Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made for the estimated cost of settling insurance claims for incidents occuring prior to balance sheet date.

These assets are expected to be used in the continuing operations of the business and, therefore no tax is expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been provided on the future remittance of overseas reserves as it is not expected that the reserves will be repatriated to the UK in the foreseeable future.

2003 2002 The maturity prole of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities is as follows: m m Facilities maturing: Within one year 40.0 87.5 Between one and two years 30.8 More than two years 205.6 131.6 245.6 249.9 Hire purchase contracts and finance leases Hire purchase contracts and finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate.
The contracts vary in length between 4 and 12 years and had a remaining weighted average duration of 1.8 years as at 31 March 2003.
44 FIRST 18 Creditors continued Loan notes The loan notes have been classied by reference to the earliest date on which the loan note holders can request redemption.
Loan notes of 20.6m 2002: 21.7m are supported by bank guarantees.
19 Financial assets and liabilities Foreign currencies At 31 March 2003, the Groups profit and loss account was not exposed to material exchange rate risk from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as all such material balances are used to hedge the Groups overseas net assets.

Sterling xed rate debt includes an all-in cost of 7.14% relating to the 300m Sterling bond.
Bank margins negotiated on oating rate debt range from 0.2% to 1.0% over Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR where applicable, or the bank base rate for the currency concerned.
Financial assets, which consist wholly of cash on deposit and in hand of 81.3m 2002: 101.4m, are all denominated in Sterling except 3.1m 2002: 6.1m in US Dollars and 1.5m 2002: 0.6m in Canadian Dollars.
Deposited cash earns interest at commercial short-term rates negotiated with counterparty banks.

As a result of movements in interest rates, differences arise between book values and fair values, which are categorised as unrecognised gains and losses as required under FRS 13.
FIRST 45 Notes to the financial statements 19 Financial assets and liabilities continued The Group also protects its financial position and performance against fuel price risk using a range of fuel derivatives.
Movements in fuel prices relative to the prices enabled by the derivatives gives rise to differences between book and fair values which are categorised as unrecognised gains and losses as required under FRS 13.
Fair values for derivatives and the bond have been supplied externally by the respective counterparties and banks using market rates prevailing at year end.
The book value of the bond is stated at its par value less issue costs of 4.9m 2002: 5.2m as required by FRS 4.
Fair values for hire purchase debt and loan notes have been determined by discounting future cash ows that will arise under these liabilities.
The movement in net unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used to hedge interest rate risk and commodity price risk are as follows: Net unrecognised gains losses 2003 2002 m m At beginning of year 5.0 0.9 Arising in previous years but recognised in the year 5.1 4.4 Arising before beginning of year and remaining at the end of the year 0.1 3.5 Arising in the year 15.8 8.5 At end of year 15.7 5.0 It is expected that 15.7m of the net unrecognised losses 2002: 5.1m will be recognised in the following year as part of exceptional costs within the interest charge 19.0m relating to the termination of certain interest rate swaps, as part of the interest charge 1.2m and as a credit to operating profit 4.5m.

The performance bonds relate to the North American businesses 80.1m and the UK Rail franchise operations 69.7m.
The letters of credit relate to insurance arrangements in the UK and North America.
The Company has provided a 9.0m 2002: 9.0m unsecured loan facility to Great Eastern Railway Limited GER, a 15.5m 2002: 15.5m unsecured loan facility to Great Western Trains Company Limited GWT and a 6.5m 2002: 6.5m unsecured loan facility to North Western Trains Company Limited NWT as required by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising.
Neither of the GER or GWT loans were drawn at 31 March 2003 nor 31 March 2002, while the NWT loan was fully drawn at 31 March 2003 and undrawn at 31 March 2002.
The Company is party to the guarantees granted to banks for overdraft and cash management facilities provided to itself and subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has given guarantees for the liabilities of its subsidiary undertakings arising under certain loan notes, hire purchase contracts, finance leases, operating leases and supply contracts.
It also provides cross guarantees to certain subsidiary undertakings as required by VAT legislation.
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have issued guarantees to the Companys bondholders.
50 FIRST 30 Pension schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American employees.
These are principally dened benefit schemes under which benets provided are based on employees number of years of service and final salary.
The scope of benets varies between schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separately administered trusts which are managed independently of the Groups nances by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
Formal independent actuarial valuations are undertaken at least triennially.
The various dened benefit schemes include five UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a scheme operated by a local authority.
These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations.
Great Eastern Railway Limited, Great Western Trains Company Limited and North Western Trains Company Limited are members of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS which is an industry-wide arrangement for employees of those companies previously owned by British Railways Board.
All other Group schemes are self-administered.
At their last triennial valuations, the dened benefit schemes had funding levels between 78% and 118%.
For those schemes that do not meet the minimum funding requirement, additional payments totalling 4.0m per annum are being made.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2003 for all dened benefit schemes totalled 934m 2002: 1,142m.
Contributions are paid to all dened benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes actuaries.
The total charge to the profit and loss account in the year in respect of dened benefit schemes was 24.1m 2002: 18.2m.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.
For these new valuations excluding the local government and RPS schemes, the assumptions which are being used are that the rate of return on investment will be 6.5% pre-retirement, and 5.5% post-retirement, the rate of earnings growth will be 4.0%, and the rate of ination will be 2.5%.
These new valuations are made using the projected unit method.
Prepayment A net prepayment of 33.2m 2002: 19.3m is included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet in respect of the sum of the cumulative differences between contributions paid by the Group into the schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account under SSAP 24, and the surpluses and deficits that have been recognised on acquisition.
Dened contribution schemes In addition, the Group operates some dened contribution schemes, the assets of which are held in separately administered trusts.
The cost of these in the year was 2.0m 2002: 1.3m.
The Group pays certain costs on behalf of the various pension schemes and then re-charges the costs to the schemes.
Transitional FRS 17 disclosures The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 during the transitional period for the dened benefit schemes are set out below.
They are based on the most recent actuarial valuations described above, which have been updated by independent professionally qualied actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.

Grants were made in October 1995 and June 1999 and a further grant was made in December 2002.
The scheme is based on eligible employees being granted options and their agreement to opening a sharesave account with a nominated savings carrier and to save weekly or monthly over a specified period.
Sharesave accounts are held with Halifax plc for the 1995 and 1999 grants and are held with Lloyds TSB for the 2002 grant.
The right to exercise the option is at the employees discretion at the end of the period previously chosen for a period of six months.
The first options under the scheme were granted on 5 October 1995 and were exercisable after either five or seven years.
Options granted in June 1999 and December 2002 are exercisable after three years.
The number of options outstanding under each grant at the end of the year was as follows: 2003 2002 Earliest Number of Ordinary 5p Number of Ordinary 5p Exercise exercise Grant date employees shares employees shares price p date October 1995 55 64,204 956 1,459,146 107.72 November 02 June 1999 68 19,059 7,427 2,095,644 359.73 September 02 December 2002 5,865 6,642,805 192.00 February 06 5,988 6,726,068 8,383 3,554,790 During the year, the Company launched a Share Incentive Plan, the Buy As You Earn scheme BAYE.
BAYE enables eligible employees to purchase shares from their gross income.
The Company provides one matching share for every two shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 15 per month.
The shares are held in trust for up to five years, in which case, no income tax and national insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
At 31 March 2003 there were 3,058 participants in the BAYE scheme who have purchased 92,570 shares with the Company contributing 29,261 matching shares.
b Executive share option schemes A new executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting.
This new scheme, together with the deferred share element of the Executive Bonus Scheme which was also introduced during 2001 02, replaces the LTIP described below.
The first grant of options under the new scheme was made in August 2001 to Directors and senior executives.
Options are exercisable between three and ten years of the date of grant provided that the pre-determined performance criteria are met.
Further details of the scheme including the performance criteria, are included in the Directors remuneration report.
Details of executive share options outstanding at 31 March 2003 are set out below: Ordinary 5p shares Date original 2003 2002 Exercise option Scheme No.

The exercise of awards under the scheme is conditional upon the attainment of performance targets.
To achieve the maximum value under an award, the Companys total shareholder return over a performance period of not less than three years must be such to place the performance relative to the returns earned by the companies in the top 25% of companies in the FTSE 250 Share Index excluding investment trusts.
An award is not exercisable if the Companys performance would place the Company below the 50th percentile of the index.
Performance between the 25th percentile and the 50th percentile of the index results in a proportion of the award being exercisable in accordance with a sliding scale.
Regardless of performance relative to the index, an award will not be exercisable unless growth in earnings per share has been greater than RPI over the performance period.
The price payable for shares upon the exercise of any award is xed at the date of grant.
Awards are, in effect, exercisable at no cost other than any tax charges to the participant.
