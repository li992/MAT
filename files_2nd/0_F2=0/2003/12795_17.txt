34 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Notes to the Accounts for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2003 1.
Accounting policies Accounting period The accounting period of the Group ends on the Saturday falling between 17 August and 24 August each year.
The accounting period ended 23 August 2003 was of 53 weeks duration, the period ended 17 August 2002 was of 52 weeks duration.
Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain properties within the Group and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In accordance with FRS 18 the Directors have continued to review the accounting policies.
There have been no changes in accounting policy.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Punch Taverns plc and all its subsidiary undertakings for the 53 weeks to 23 August 2003.
All subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
Accordingly, the Group profit and loss account and statement of cash flows include the results and cash flows of subsidiaries from the date of acquisition to the period end.
The comparative Group profit and loss account and statement of cash flows also include the results and cash flows of the demerged Managed pub business for the period to 2 March 2002, being the date of its demerger from the Group.
On 2 March 2002, the Group was reorganised by separating the Managed pub business Spirit Group and the Leased and tenanted pub business Punch Pub Company by demerging Spirit Group to form a separate group of companies the Demerger.
The Demerger was achieved by paying a dividend in specie in the form of the Groups shares in the Spirit Group.
Goodwill and negative goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the balance sheet within intangible fixed assets and is amortised over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
Acquisitions giving rise to goodwill and their associated amortisation periods of 20 years commenced as follows: Punch Taverns Group Ltd September 1999 Commer Inns December 2001 White Rose Inns Ltd May 2002 Conquest Inns Ltd December 2002 Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions is included within intangible fixed assets and is amortised over the estimated useful life of the nonmonetary assets acquired, which is approximately 22 years.
Acquisitions giving rise to negative goodwill and their associated amortisation periods commenced as follows: Inn Business Group plc September 1999 Allied Domecq Retailing Holdings Ltd September 1999 Fixed assets and depreciation Valuation Leased estate Trading properties within the Leased estate are revalued professionally by independent valuers on a five-year rolling basis.
Surpluses arising from the professional valuation of the licensed estate are taken directly to the revaluation reserve.
Valuation surpluses realised on sale are transferred from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account reserve.
Any deficit arising from the professional valuation of properties is taken directly to the revaluation reserve until the carrying amount reaches historical cost and thereafter, deficits below historical cost are charged to the profit and loss account except to the extent that the value in use exceeds the valuation in which case this is taken to the revaluation reserve.
Cost Managed estate discontinued activity Properties in the managed estate were carried at their historic cost to the Group, less provisions for depreciation and impairment.
Depreciation Leased estate It is the Groups policy to maintain the properties comprising the licensed estate in such a condition that the residual values of the properties, based on prices prevailing at the time of acquisition or subsequent revaluation, are at least equal to their book values.
The primary responsibility for the maintenance of such properties, ensuring that they remain in sound operational condition, is normally that of the lessee as required by their lease contracts with the Group.
Having regard to this, it is the opinion of the Directors that depreciation of any such property as required by the Companies Act 1985 and generally accepted accounting practice would not be material.
35 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Notes to the Accounts continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2003 1.
Accounting policies continued It is the opinion of the Directors that in respect of the Leased estate it is not practical or appropriate to separate from the value of the buildings the value of long life fixtures and fittings, which are an integral part of the buildings.
This approach is supported by the opinion of an independent external adviser.
Landlords fixtures and fittings in the Leased estate include removable items, which are generally regarded as within landlord ownership.
These are depreciated in accordance with the policy detailed below.
An annual impairment review is carried out on all properties in accordance with FRS 11 and FRS 15.
Depreciation is provided on other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Short leasehold properties over the lease term Landlords fixtures and fittings 5 years Office furniture and fittings 5 years Information technology developments 3 to 5 years Information technology equipment 3 years Motor vehicles 5 years Depreciation Managed estate discontinued activity Prior to the Demerger of the managed business, depreciation was provided on tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land which was not depreciated, at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold land and buildings 50 years Short leasehold land and buildings over the lease term Public house fixtures and fittings 5 to 25 years Office fixtures and fittings 3 to 10 years Information technology equipment 3 to 5 years Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, or gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of those assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leasing commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
36 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Notes to the Accounts continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2003 1.
Accounting policies continued Pensions Prior to Demerger the Group operated a defined benefit pension scheme, which required contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The principal employer was Spirit Group Ltd, which was disposed at Demerger, and consequently the Group ceased at that time to operate its own defined benefit pension scheme.
Employees of the continuing business who were members of that scheme continued to be members following Demerger up until April 2003 when contributions ceased.
Contributions to this fund were charged in the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives within the Group.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged in the profit and loss account were treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The Group now contributes to money purchase plans in respect of employees who were members of the defined benefit scheme.
The Group contributes to money purchase pension plans for other employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Capital instruments Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits and if not they are included in shareholders funds.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Derivative financial instruments are held to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
To qualify as a hedge the financial instrument must be related to actual borrowings or a probable commitment and must reduce the risk of interest rate movements.
Gains and losses arising on these financial instruments are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups accounts.
The cost or income associated with caps and floors is recognised over the lesser of their duration or the period of the loans to which they relate, so as to give a constant proportion of the related loan notes outstanding.
In respect of interest rate swaps, interest differentials are recognised by accruing for net interest payable.
If interest rate caps, floors or swaps are terminated early the gain or loss arising is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge because the underlying financial position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Turnover and segmental analysis Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, represents amounts charged to third parties.
The majority of the turnover is attributable to the primary activity of leasing public houses to independent publicans, the wholesale supply of beer products to lessees Leased and, in periods prior to the demerger of the managed estate on 2 March 2002, also related to retailing through pubs, restaurants, bars and hotels Managed.
All turnover, operating profit and assets and liabilities in the current period relate to the Leased estate.
Acquisitions in the period relate to the Leased sector and do not have a material impact on the reported results.
Turnover and operating profit in respect of the period ended 17 August 2002 relate to both the Leased estate continuing operations and the Managed estate discontinued activities up to Demerger on 2 March 2002.
Following Demerger, all remaining assets related to the Leased estate.
Turnover, operating profit and net assets in respect of period ended 17 August 2002 are split by class of business as follows: Turnover Operating profit Net assets m m m Leased continuing activity 391.8 199.4 494.4 Managed discontinued activities 242.9 50.3 634.7 249.7 494.4 37 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Notes to the Accounts continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2003 3.

2 The minority interests, which represented employees shareholdings, were converted into shares in the Company on flotation in May 2002.
As the Companys shares are now traded on the London Stock Exchange, there were no such charges in current period nor will there be any in subsequent periods.
3 Taxation consultancy costs incurred in the prior period were in respect of the successful resolution with the Inland Revenue of a capital allowance claim made by the Group in the period ended 30 September 1998.

The forgiveness of loan arose in connection with the Demerger in order to re-allocate between the two businesses the debt owing under the Punch Funding II Ltd loan arrangements.
Included in non-cash items was 1.8m write off of an investment held by PGL A1 Ltd in the Companys Class A Preference shares pursuant to a Court approved capital reduction.

Interest payable for 2002 includes 17.2m paid out of monies received from Spirit Group Ltd see note 6 in respect of their share of interest on the Punch Funding II Ltd secured loan notes accruing between 2 March 2002, the Demerger date and the repayment of those secured loans on 28 June 2002.
Taxation The tax charge is made up as follows: Period ended Period ended 17 August 2002 23 August Continuing Discontinued 2003 operations operations Total m m m m Current tax: UK corporation tax 1.8 Tax under provided in previous periods 0.1 4.2 4.2 1.7 4.2 4.2 Deferred tax: Current period charge 14.0 4.0 1.5 5.5 Deferred tax under provision in prior periods 4.2 4.2 14.0 8.2 1.5 9.7 15.7 4.0 1.5 5.5 Factors affecting current and future tax charges The current tax charge for the period reflects the utilisation of brought forward losses not previously recognised as deferred tax assets.
The deferred tax charge arises in respect of the origination and reversal of timing differences.
The Groups current period deferred tax charge reflects that in the period capital allowances exceeded depreciation.
This position is expected to continue given the Groups accounting policy not to charge depreciation on freehold and long leasehold property on the basis that this would not be material.
The tax charge will be lower than the standard corporation tax rate of 30% over the next two to three years if the Group is successful in using brought forward losses.
The charge to UK corporation tax is reconciled as follows: Reconciliation of tax charges Period ended Period ended 17 August 2002 23 August Continuing Discontinued 2003 operations operations Total m m m m Profit loss on ordinary activities before taxation 113.3 120.1 18.0 102.1 Profit loss on ordinary activities at standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% 34.0 36.0 5.4 30.6 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2.1 6.2 0.2 6.4 Timing differences relating to fixed assets 12.0 11.8 2.7 14.5 Short-term timing differences 0.9 0.6 0.6 Timing differences relating to interest on loans 23.9 23.9 Non deductible forgiveness of loan on Demerger 43.2 43.2 Profit on disposal of joint venture 0.5 0.5 Profit on sale of tangible fixed assets 0.8 1.5 0.6 2.1 Loss on sale of current asset investment 0.5 0.5 Utilisation of tax losses brought forward 20.6 1.6 1.6 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of previous periods 0.1 4.2 4.2 Intra-Group financing charges pre-demerger 3.5 3.5 Surplus current period losses 22.0 1.1 23.1 Corporation tax charge credit for period 1.7 4.2 4.2 40 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Notes to the Accounts continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2003 8.
Taxation continued Reconciliation of tax charges continued The taxation charge for the period is reduced due to utilisation of brought-forward losses within the Group.
There is no taxation charge or credit for the period or the prior period in respect of the non-operating exceptional profit on disposal of fixed assets or the cost of fundamental reorganisation.
The deferred taxation charge for the prior period was reduced by 1.4m as a result of exceptional items.
Profit loss attributable to members of the parent company The Company made a profit after tax for the period of 45.7m August 2002: loss of 7.8m.
The Company retained profits of 29.6m August 2002: deficit of 41.4m.
Dividends Period ended Period ended 23 August 17 August 2003 2002 m m Equity dividends on ordinary shares: Interim paid 2.1 pence 2002: Nil pence 5.2 Final proposed 4.4 pence 2002: Nil pence 10.9 16.1 Non-equity dividends Accrued dividend on non-equity shares 28.6 Special dividend relating to the Demerger 93.4 64.8 11.
Earnings loss per ordinary share a Basic earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings loss per share is based on a total profit of 97.6m August 2002: loss, after non-equity dividends, of 42.8m, and weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the period of 248,037,266 August 2002: 60,047,377. b Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is the basic earnings per share after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into Ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share of 39.2 pence August 2002: loss per share of 71.3 pence has been calculated using basic earnings of 97.6m August 2002: loss of 42.8m and after including the effect of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of shares can be reconciled as follows: Period ended Period ended 23 August 17 August 2003 2002 No No Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 248,037,266 60,047,377 Dilutive effect from share options 966,363 Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 249,003,629 60,047,377 c Pro forma earnings per share A pro forma calculation is included rather than an adjusted earnings per share as defined by FRS 14, in order to better reflect the underlying performance in the period ended 17 August 2002.
This is achieved by reflecting the capital structure as if both the separation of the financing arrangements of the discontinued business and the IPO had occurred on 19 August 2000.
The number of shares used for the purpose of calculating the pro forma adjusted earnings per share in the prior period is 248,000,000 being the number of shares in issue following flotation.
This number of shares is used in the calculation as the majority of those shares were issued in respect of either conversion from quasi-equity, being Series A, C and D loan notes and Preference shares, or funding the redemption of quasi-equity such that quasi-equity was eliminated by Demerger and IPO.

Earnings loss per ordinary share continued For the period ended 17 August 2002, the calculation of adjusted earnings is based on the profit before non-recurring and exceptional items, net of tax, in continuing operations adjusted for the following: Notional interest receivable under a pro forma assumption that IPO proceeds initially retained were received on 19 August 2000.
Additional interest payable relating to the interest bearing element of realigned debt under a pro forma assumption that separation of the financing arrangements occurred on 19 August 2000.
It has not been necessary to make any adjustments to basic earnings or to the weighted average number of shares for the purposes of calculating pro forma earnings per share in the current period.
Basic earnings are adjusted as follows: Period ended Period ended 23 August 17 August 2003 2002 m m Profit for the period 97.6 67.9 Pro forma interest receivable less payable 0.2 Taxation impact on pro forma adjustments 0.1 Pro forma earnings 97.6 68.0 The comparative profit for the period relates to continuing operations before non-recurring and exceptional items.

The Groups policy is to carry properties within the estate at valuation.
The trading properties within the Leased estate are revalued professionally by independent valuers on a five-year rolling basis.
Surpluses arising from the professional valuation of the estate are taken directly to the revaluation reserve.
During both the period ended 23 August 2003 and period ended 17 August 2002, 20% of the licensed premises of the Group were valued in accordance with market practice by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Ltd, Chartered Surveyors, acting as external valuers.
The valuation did not include any element relating to the trading potential of the licensed premises.
The valuation of the remaining portfolio has not been updated, as the Directors are not aware of any material change in value.

The final instalment for each class of note being on the date indicated in its description.
With reference to Punch Funding II Ltd, the interest rates on the secured floating rate notes increase after 28 June 2005.
The Group has the right to redeem these notes at that date at their nominal value.
The other bank loans are at floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
The above secured loan notes have been secured by way of fixed and floating charges over various assets of the Group.
Hedging instruments The Group has taken out various hedging instruments to reduce the interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as follows: Punch Taverns Finance Ltd The Group has entered into interest rate swaps including synthetic swaps which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A1, Class A2 and Class A3 floating rate notes to fixed rates ranging from 6.2% to 6.5175% per annum.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the expected repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
In October 2000 the Group entered into a swaption exercisable before 15 October 2005 which can swap LIBOR on a capital amount of up to 25.0m for a fixed rate of 9% until October 2027.
Punch Funding II Ltd The Group has entered into interest rate swaps which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class M, Class N1 and Class O floating rate notes to afixed rate of 6.4973% per annum.
In June 2000 the Group entered into a swaption exercisable before 28 June 2005 which can swap LIBOR on a capital amount of up to 23.6m for a fixed rate of 8% until June 2030.
Other bank loans In January 2003 the Group entered into interest rate swaps which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.44% until January 2005.
The nominal capital impacted varies over the life of the swap being 17.2m from January 2003, 21.8m from October 2003, 21.0m from April 2004 and 20.2m from October 2004 through to January 2005.
Financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings and some cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds, loan notes and other bank loans.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs financial instruments to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging, where this is financially practical, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
As set out in note 19, the Group has taken out capital instruments such that 91% of all loans at 23 August 2003 August 2002: 92% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements.

Pension commitments The Groups employees were previously members of the Spirit Group Pension Scheme.
Until 5 April 2003 the Group continued to contribute to the scheme but no longer operated it.
Employees of the continuing business who were members of that scheme continued to be members following the Demerger until the Group ceased to participate in the scheme on 5 April 2003.
The assets of the scheme were held separately from those of the Group, being invested in managed funds.
The Group has its own defined contribution pension scheme into which existing members of the Spirit Group Pension Scheme will be given the opportunity to transfer the value of their benefits or they will be able to leave their deferred benefits in the Spirit Group Pension Scheme.
These transfers have yet to be arranged.
58 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Notes to the Accounts continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2003 29.
Pension commitments continued In the prior period contributions to the defined benefit scheme were charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives within the Group.
The contributions were determined by a qualified actuary, on the basis of triennial valuations, using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation was as at 5 April 2001.
The valuation method used was the projected unit method with the following main assumptions: Long term average investment yield before retirement 6.8% after retirement 5.8% Long term average earnings increase 3.9% Increases to pensions in payment with 3% underpin 3.5% without 3% underpin 2.4% Long term average price inflation 2.4% The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 52.8m and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 92% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for future increases in benefits.
As a consequence of the Demerger, the Group was required to cease membership of the scheme by 5 April 2003 and, accordingly, has ceased to make contributions to or record any ongoing costs in respect of this scheme.
The Directors have received independent advice and correspondingly provided 2.1m before deferred taxation during the period ended 17 August 2002 relating to a potential one-off contribution to the scheme in respect of the Groups employees who were members of the scheme.
FRS 17 disclosures The FRS 17 disclosures in the prior period allowed for the Demerger by splitting the figures for the whole Spirit Group Scheme at the start of the period between continuing and discontinued operations and treated the two sections as separate entities thereafter.
The current period disclosures reflect the Groups continued participation in the Scheme for part of the period.
However, going forward the Group will not have any deferred liabilities or assets associated with the scheme.
The settlement gain in this periods FRS 17 pension cost anticipates this position.
The Company contributed to the scheme at the rates of 23% of Pensionable Salaries for executives and 11% for others since the scheme commenced on 5 April 2000.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the latest valuation scheme for FRS 17 purposes for the periods ended 18 August 2001 and 17 August 2002 were: Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 3.5% for former members of the Allied arrangements 2.5% for all other members Discount rate 5.7% Inflation assumption 2.5% The contributions paid for the period which equates to the charge for the period in respect of the defined benefit scheme were 0.3m August 2002: 1.6m.

The Group contributes to individual money purchase pension plans for other employees.
The Groups costs under the money purchase pension plans were 0.8m August 2002: 0.6m.
Related party disclosures Current period information During the period 34 pubs were acquired for cash from Spirit Group Limited, part of the managed business demerged in March 2002, for 12.8m.
Prior period information Prior to IPO in May 2002, certain Directors had interests in the loan notes of the Company.

Contingent liabilities The Demerger of the Managed pub business was carried out under the provisions of ss213-218 ICTA 1988 during the period ended 17 August 2002.
Usually, where a chargeable asset for tax purposes is transferred from one company to another company and both companies are within the same group, this transfer is at no gain no loss initially for tax purposes.
However, by virtue of s179 TCGA 1992 where the transferee company leaves the groups ownership within six years of the date of the transfer, a capital gain or loss will arise on the transferee by reference to the market value of the asset and the no gain no loss acquisition consideration.
Where the transferee company leaves the group under an exempt distribution, there is an exemption from the s179 charge.
However, the exemption from charge under s179 TCGA 1992 does not apply if there is a chargeable payment a payment not made for bona fide commercial reasons or made for tax avoidance purposes within five years of the exempt distribution.
A Deed of Tax Covenant was entered into by the Group and Spirit Group Holdings Ltd on 2 March 2002 as part of the Demerger.
Under this Deed of Tax Covenant the Group has indemnified the Managed pub business for any s179 TCGA 1992 exit charges that would arise if the Group made a chargeable payment within 5 years of the Demerger or otherwise prevented the Demerger dividend from being an exempt distribution.
Post balance sheet events On 3 November 2003 the Group concluded a refinancing, the principal elements of which are set out below: The following new loan notes were issued by Punch Taverns Finance plc formerly Limited : m Class A3 R Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2009 150 Class M1 5.883% Secured Notes due 2026 200 Class M2 Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2026 400 Class C R 6.468% Secured Notes due 2033 215 965 In addition the remaining fixed rate secured loans issued by Punch Funding II Limited have been replaced by identical loan notes issued by Punch Taverns Finance plc.

Post balance sheet events continued The proceeds of these notes were used as follows: m Repayment of existing loans par value : Punch Taverns Finance plc Class A1 Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2008 98 Class A2 Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2011 85 Class A3 Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2015 95 Class C Secured Notes due 2027 Fixed to 2005, Floating thereafter 25 303 Punch Funding II Limited Class M Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2029 192 Class N1 Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2030 45 Class O Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2030 30 267 Other group companies Bank loans 109 Total loans repaid 679 Accrued interest, premiums on redemption and issue costs paid 19 Adjustments to cash balances retained for working capital purposes 2 Cash available for investment purposes 265 965 The refinancing simplifies the Groups securitisation structure, since all secured loan notes are now issued by Punch Taverns Finance plc within a single securitisation net.
In addition to raising funds of about 265m for investment, the refinancing results in the maturity profile of the Groups borrowings being improved.
The effective interest rates on the Groups borrowings will be reduced, although the decrease will be modest, due to the continuing effect of the interest rate swaps the Group presently has in place.
The deficit on redeeming existing borrowings of about 7m will be expensed in the profit and loss account for the period ending 21 August 2004, as exceptional items within financing costs.
The Group has also negotiated additional loan facilities outside the Punch Taverns Finance plc securitisation net of 225m, which are available to finance pub acquisitions.
On 6 November 2003 the Directors announced that Punch Taverns Reserve Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, had entered into an agreement relating to the purchase of the entire ordinary issued share capital of Pubmistress Ltd the holding company of the Pubmaster Group.
The acquisition values Pubmaster at approximately 1,193m including the assumption of 1,025m of debt with a payment of approximately 5m in respect of working capital.
Pubmaster is a leading leased and tenanted pub company with an estate of over 3,100 pubs located across Great Britain.
In order to assess possible competition concerns Punch Group Equity Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, has entered into an agreement for the sale of 206 pubs 92 from the Punch Estate and 114 from the Pubmaster Estate to Flightwater Ltd, a special purpose vehicle owned and managed by a third party.
In view of its size, the acquisition is conditional upon the approval of Punch Shareholders at a duly convened Extraordinary General Meeting.
