52 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 53 1.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned life insurance and non insurance subsidiary undertakings, have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 255A of, and the special provisions relating to insurance groups of Schedule 9A to, the Companies Act 1985.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which have been applied consistently except as noted below, and with the Association of British Insurers Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting for Insurance Business ABI SORP dated November 2003.
There has been no material impact on the financial statements as a result of adopting the revised ABI SORP.
The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985 adopting the exemption conferred by Section 230 of that Act of omitting the profit and loss account.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
The Company has adopted UITF38 Accounting for ESOP trusts in these financial statements.
Further information is provided in the accounting policy for share options, shown on page 56.
The adoption of UITF38 does not have a material impact on the profit and loss account for either year.
A reclassification of 1.6 million has been made between the profit and loss reserve and the own shares reserve in 2002, relating to amounts charged in respect of the scheme for earlier years.
In addition, 2.6 million has been reclassified between other debtors and own shares reserve in 2002.
Profit recognition relating to the value of long-term business in-force Profits emerging on long-term assurance business in-force are determined in accordance with the Modified Statutory Solvency Basis of reporting, which is consistent with the ABI SORP.
Under this method, the statutory result arising in the period, which includes the long-term business provision determined in consultation with the Appointed Actuaries following their annual investigations, is required to be adjusted under the Companies Act 1985 Insurance Companies Accounts Regulations 1993 for certain items, including the deferral of acquisition costs and movements in certain reserves, which are recognised in the long-term business technical account.
Premiums Premiums are accounted for when receivable, other than unit-linked premiums, which are credited to revenue when the associated liability is established.
Reinsurance premiums are charged as they become payable.
Investment return Investment return comprises investment income including dividends, interest, realised investment gains and losses, movements in unrealised investment gains and losses and related expenses.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 54 Dividends are included as investment income on the date that shares become quoted ex-dividend.
Interest and expenses are included on an accruals basis.
Realised investment gains and losses are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds and the purchase price.
Unrealised investment gains and losses represent the difference between the valuation of investments at the balance sheet date and their original cost or, if they have been previously valued, their valuation at the last balance sheet date.
Net rental income is recorded when due.
Claims Claims are charged to revenue when they become due for payment or, in the case of deaths, when notification of death is received.
Recoveries from risk reassurances are included in the same period as the relevant claims.
Acquisition costs Costs of acquiring new insurance contracts principally comprise commission and costs associated with policy issue and underwriting, which are not matched by policy charges.
Such costs are deferred and amortised against margins in the future revenues of the insurance contracts, to the extent that the amounts are recoverable out of the margins.
This deferred acquisition cost is included as an asset within the balance sheet.
Movements in that asset are shown in acquisition expenses.
In all instances the deferred acquisition costs are calculated before tax with an appropriate charge or credit being made for deferred tax.
Investments Investments held to cover linked long-term assurance liabilities are stated at their current value.
Investments comprise listed securities, units in authorised unit trusts and OEICs, deposits and property.
Listed investments are included at mid-market value, units in unit trusts and OEICs are at published bid prices and deposits are included at cost.
Land and buildings occupied by the Group for its own activities, which are depreciated over their useful economic lives of 50 years, are stated at market value on a vacant possession basis for existing use.
Unlisted investments are included at Directors' valuation.
Derivative instrument contracts, which comply with regulatory requirements for use within the internal linked funds, are held at market value.
All derivatives are used solely for hedging purposes.
All realised and unrealised gains and losses on investments held within the long-term business fund are dealt with in the technical account.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses on other investments are included in profit before taxation in the non-technical account.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the separately identifiable assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition.
Prior to 1998, purchased goodwill was eliminated against reserves as a matter of accounting policy, as all such transactions took place before FRS10 became effective on 23 December 1998.
As permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS10, such amounts previously written off to reserves have not been reinstated as an asset, but will be charged to the profit and loss account on disposal of the businesses to which they relate.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 55 Long-term business provision and technical provisions The long-term business provision is calculated on actuarial principles.
The calculation is in accordance with statutory reporting for solvency and uses the gross premium method.
The provisions held for linked liabilities are the unit liabilities together with certain non-unit provisions.
Whilst the Directors consider that the gross long-term business provision and the related reinsurance recovery is fairly stated on the basis of current experience and economic conditions, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent changes in experience and economic conditions and may result in adjustments to the amount provided in future.
The provision, estimation techniques, and assumptions are periodically reviewed in the light of changes in experience and economic conditions with any changes in estimates reflected in the long-term business technical account as they occur.
Present value of acquired long-term business in-force In accordance with the ABI SORP, the present value of acquired long-term business in-force PVIF is recognised as an additional asset within the consolidated balance sheet.
The value determined at the date of acquisition is amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
The rate of amortisation is chosen by considering the profile of the in-force business acquired and the expected reduction in its value over time.
The carrying value of the amortised PVIF asset is also tested for impairment on an annual basis.
The amortisation charge for the year is charged to the long-term business technical account, included within other technical charges.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets The cost of fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental cost of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values, over the expected useful economic lives as follows: % per annum On a straight line basis: 1 Computers 33 3 Fixtures and fittings 20 Office equipment 20 Motor vehicles 25 Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 56 Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pensions The SJPC Group operates a defined contribution personal pension plan for its employees.
The contributions payable to the scheme are recognised within the technical account for the accounting period in which they occur.
The Group also has an occupational scheme with both a defined contribution and a defined benefit section, both of which are closed to new members.
No employer contributions were made for the defined benefit section.
Share options A charge is recognised on options granted to subscribe for new shares in SJPC, or options over shares held by the SJPC Employee Share Trust, based on the difference between the market value of SJPC shares at the date of the award, and the exercise price.
Where appropriate, this charge is spread over the period that performance criteria apply.
Deferred charges, to be charged in future years, will be adjusted to reflect evidence regarding whether the performance criteria will be met.
The consideration paid for shares acquired by the SJPC Employee Share Trust, that have not yet vested unconditionally to option holders, is recorded in the own shares reserve.

INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS The Group holds an investment of 22.7% in the shares of Life Assurance Holding Corporation Limited LAHC which carry voting rights of 19.9% 2002: 23% holding and voting rights.
This investment has been dealt with in the consolidated accounts for prior years as an associated undertaking and equity accounted.
Since 25 July 2003 it has been treated as an investment as noted below.
As a result of a number of issues that have arisen in recent years, LAHC has carried out a review of its future strategy and its financing arrangements.
This has led to the decision that the operations will concentrate on the run-off of the existing book of business in order to optimise the level of cash generation and future dividends.
LAHC does not propose to undertake any significant acquisitions.
This has been implemented in the form of consequential changes to the management structure and the nature and scale of LAHC's operations.
SJPC has commented in previous financial statements that it regards LAHC as a non-core investment.
In view of the change of strategy outlined above, SJPC has taken the opportunity to reduce significantly the amount of Directors time spent on LAHC's affairs.
Accordingly, Sir Mark Weinberg resigned as Chairman of LAHC on 23 July 2003 and both he and Derek Netherton resigned from the LAHC Board on 25 July 2003.
In addition, and with the agreement of LAHC's other shareholders, SJPC entered into an irrevocable deed to restrict its voting interest in LAHC to 19.9% on 25 July 2003.
As a consequence of the above, the SJPC Board reviewed the accounting treatment for the holding in LAHC, which has been treated as an investment from 25 July 2003.
The holding is disclosed within Shares and other variable yield securities as at 31 December 2003 see note 16.
The impact of the change in accounting treatment during 2003 of the carrying value of LAHC as an associated undertaking is as follows: Million Value at 1 January 2003 29.2 Share of pre-tax profit for the period to 30 June 2003 3.4 Share of tax for the period to 30 June 2003 1.0 Value at 30 June 2003 31.6 Transfer to investments 31.6 Value of associated undertaking at 31 December 2003 Nil 16.

LONG-TERM BUSINESS TECHNICAL PROVISIONS The long-term business provision is determined in consultation with the Appointed Actuaries following their annual investigations of the long-term business.
The assumptions underlying the calculation of the UK long-term business provision for statutory solvency purposes have been determined in accordance with industry accepted actuarial techniques and are detailed in the returns to the Financial Services Authority.
These returns are due to be submitted by 31 March 2004 and will then be available to any shareholder on request.
The principal assumptions used in calculating the provisions for linked and non-linked policies are noted below together with details on the sensitivity of these assumptions.
Linked policies The long-term provision consists of sterling reserves designed to cover any future cash flows without recourse to additional capital.
The cash flows are projected assuming: unit growth rates between 4.8% and 6% per annum 2002: between 4% and 6%, depending on the tax status and territory of the contract: a projection of current expenses assuming expense inflation of between 3.5% and 4% per annum 2002: between 3% and 4%, depending on the territory of the contract: and mortality and morbidity costs are derived from actual rates charged by reassurers and industry experience.
The resulting cash flows are discounted at a rate of interest between 3.5% and 4.75% 2002: between 3% and 4.25%, depending on the tax status and territory of the contract to calculate the sterling reserve.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 72 25.
LONG-TERM BUSINESS TECHNICAL PROVISIONS CONTINUED Non-linked policies The long-term provisions are calculated using the gross premium valuation method.
The assumed rate of interest is 3.25% 2002: 3.0%.
Mortality rates are based on recognised mortality tables suitably adjusted to reflect actual experience.
Morbidity rates are derived from the Companys own experience, published data, the rates charged by reassurers and industry experience.
Sensitivities The calculation of the long-term technical provision is sensitive to the above assumptions and noted in the table below is the estimated impact on the provision, net of reassurance, to changes in these assumptions.
Impact Assumption Change million Unit growth 1% 1.3 -1% 1.2 Interest rates 1% 4.4 -1% 6.2 Expense inflation 1% 7.0 -1% 5.1 Wherever possible it is the policy of the Group to 'match' the long-term technical provision with appropriate assets, to reduce the impact of changes in the assumptions on the financial position of the Group.
For example a 1% reduction in interest rates whilst increasing the level of the provision by an estimated 6 million will also result in the value of the fixed interest securities matching the provision increasing in value by a corresponding amount.
Thus the potential impact on the shareholder from changes in the above assumptions has been reduced accordingly.
Critical illness As previously reported, in 2001 the Group entered into a financial reassurance arrangement with respect to the uncertainty on its critical illness claims experience.
Under the terms of this financial reassurance arrangement, the reassurer has agreed to maintain the current reassurance rates, provided it can recover experience in excess of those rates from profits on future new business written by the Group.
These arrangements remain in place.
The Group has included in its statutory long-term provision prior to reassurance, reserves of 11.6 million 2002: 18.3 million as a result of the financial reassurance, although the net provision after reassurance remains unchanged.
This financial reassurance has been accounted for in accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions and accordingly a liability of 11.6 million 2002: 18.3 million has been established.
The cash balance outstanding under the arrangement at 31 December 2003 was, however, nil 2002: nil.
Regulatory reviews Following the completion of the various required regulatory reviews, there are no provisions outstanding at 31 December 2003 2002: nil.
