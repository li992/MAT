Dividend policy The Board remains committed to a progressive dividend policy, although this will be subject to maintaining a reasonable level of dividend cover over the medium term as well as our intention to utilise cash ow to invest in capital expenditure and bolt-on acquisitions.
The increase of 10.0% in the dividend for 2002, followed by an increase of 10.1% for 2003, reects the introduction of a more progressive approach to dividend payments.
Future dividends will be dependent upon Hansons earnings, financial condition and other factors.
