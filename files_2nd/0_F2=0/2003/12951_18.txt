Notes to the Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2003 1 Nature of Operations The Company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures the Group carry out gold mining activities and exploration.
The Group currently has one operating mine in Mali, West Africa, the Morila Gold Mine, which commenced production in October 2000, one mine in Mali under care and maintenance, namely the Syama Mine, a mine in development, the Loulo Mine, also in Mali, another project at feasibility stage as well as a portfolio of exploration projects in West and East Africa.
The decision to develop the Loulo Mine was made at the board meeting held on 22 December 2003 and development of the project is already at an advanced stage.
Production is expected to begin towards the middle of 2005.
The Tongon project in Cte dIvoire is at an earlier stage of feasibility, where the data currently available is less accurate, requiring further detailed work to be performed.
The data currently available is of a sufficient level for preliminary economic analysis to be undertaken as a result of the political situation in Cte dIvoire, which started in September 2002.
No further exploration activity has been possible on this project.
The main focus of exploration work is on its advanced projects in Mali West, around Morila and in Senegal and more recently Tanzania.
The interests of the Group are Morila SA Morila which owns the Morila Mine and Somilo SA Somilo which conducts the exploration and development activities over the Loulo site and Somisy SA Somisy which owns and operated the Syama Mine.
Randgold Resources holds an effective 40% interest in Morila, following the sale to AngloGold Limited on July 3, 2000 of one half of Randgold Resources' wholly owned subsidiary, Morila Limited.
Management of Morila Limited, the 80% shareholder of Morila, is effected through a joint venture committee, with Randgold Resources and AngloGold each appointing one half of the members of the committee.
AngloGold Services Mali SA Anser, a subsidiary of AngloGold, is the operator of Morila.
In December 2001 the Syama operation was placed on care and maintenance.
Activities since then at the Syama Mine have been focused on preserving the assets.
In March 2003, the Company granted Resolute Mining Limited Resolute a twelve month option to purchase its shareholding in the Syama Mine, under which Resolute undertook to pay a US$75 thousand a month option fee, and providing its due diligence proved viable it would acquire the shareholding for a cash consideration of US$6 million, plus a further US$7 million of the Syama Mines debt in exchange for Resolute scrip.
A final decision will be made pending the outcome of the due diligence being undertaken by Resolute, which expires in April 2004.
2 Significant Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading, which comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
A summary of the significant accounting policies, which have been applied consistently for all years covered by this report, is set out below.
GENERAL: The financial statements are measured and presented in US dollars, as it is the primary functional currency in which transactions are undertaken.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to US dollars at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period.
Translation gains and losses arising at year end, as well as those arising on the translation of settled transactions occurring in currencies other than the functional currency, are included in net income.
CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial information includes the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and Companys proportionate share of its joint venture.
A company in which the Group holds directly or indirectly, through other subsidiary undertakings, a controlling interest is classified as a subsidiary undertaking.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date control ceases.
The minority interest in the consolidated equity and in the consolidated results are shown separately.
Any excess or deficits of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the subsidiary acquired is attributed to mineral property interests and amortised under the Group accounting policies.
The results of subsidiaries are included from effective dates of acquisition and up to the effective dates of disposal.
Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures are those investments in which the Group has joint control and are accounted for under the proportional consolidation method.
Under this method, the proportion of assets, liabilities and income and expenses and cash flows of each joint venture attributable to the Group are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate headings.
The results of joint ventures are included from the effective dates of acquisition and up to the effective dates of disposal.
Any excess or deficits of the purchase price when compared to the Group share of the fair value of the joint 64 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2003 venture acquired is attributed to mineral property interests and amortised in accordance with Group accounting policies.
CASH AND EQUIVALENTS include all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
INVENTORIES which include ore stockpiles, gold in process and supplies and insurance spares, are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The cost of ore stockpiles and gold produced is determined principally by the weighted average cost method using related production costs.
Stockpiles consist of two types of ore, high grade and medium grade ore, which will be processed through the processing plant.
Both high and medium grade stockpiles are currently being processed and all ore is expected to be fully processed within the life of mine.
The processing of ore in stockpiles occurs in accordance with the life of mine processing plan that has been optimised based on the known mineral reserves, current plant capacity and mine design.
EXPLORATION COSTS are expensed as incurred.
Costs related to property acquisitions are capitalised.
UNDEVELOPED PROPERTIES upon which the Group has not performed sufficient exploration work to determine whether significant mineralisation exists, are carried at original cost.
Where the directors consider that there is little likelihood of the properties being exploited, or the value of the exploitable rights have diminished below cost, a writedown is recorded.
DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND MINE PLANT FACILITIES relating to existing mines are capitalised.
Development costs consist primarily of direct expenditure to develop an ore body for economic exploitation and to expand the production capacity of existing operating mines.
Following the completion of a bankable feasibility study, development costs, which include interest on borrowed funds, used to place new mines into production and to complete major development projects at operating mines, are capitalised.
Ongoing costs to maintain production are expensed as incurred.
DEFERRED STRIPPING COSTS: The costs of waste stripping in excess of the expected pit life average stripping ratio are deferred and charged to production when the actual ratio is below the expected average ratio.
The expected pit life average stripping ratio is calculated as the ratio of future anticipated waste tons to be mined, to anticipated future ore tons to be mined.
This ratio is recalculated annually in light of additional knowledge and changes in estimates.
The expected pit life ratio is then compared to waste associated with ore mined during the period so as to calculate the deferred stripping costs to be deferred or released for the year.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION: Long-lived assets include mining properties, mine development costs and mine plant facilities.
These assets have useful economic lives which exceed that of the life of the mine.
Depreciation and amortisation are therefore charged over the life of the mine based on estimated ore tons contained in proven and probable reserves.
Proven and probable ore reserves reflect estimated quantities of economically recoverable reserves, which can be recovered in the future from known mineral deposits.
Short-lived assets which include motor vehicles, office equipment and computer equipment, are depreciated over estimated useful lives of two to five years.
MINING PROPERTY EVALUATIONS: Recoverability of the long-term assets of the Group, which include development costs, deferred stripping costs and undeveloped property costs, together with other current assets, is reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In determining if the asset can be recovered, the Group compares the value in use amount to the carrying amount.
If the carrying amount exceeds the value in use amount, the Group will record an impairment charge in the income statement to write down the asset to the value in use amount.
To determine the value in use amount, management makes its best estimate of the future cash inflows that will be obtained each year over the life of the mine and discounts the cash flow by a rate that is based on the time value of money adjusted for the risk associated with the applicable project.
Managements best estimate includes only those projections which it believes are reliable, and which based upon past experience, it has the ability to accurately forecast.
These estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties including future metal prices.
In addition, other factors that management cannot control may turn out differently than that projected and could have an effect on the determination of the value in use amount.
It is therefore reasonably possible that changes could occur which may affect the recoverability of the mining assets.
REHABILITATION COSTS: The net present value of estimated future rehabilitation cost estimates is recognised and provided for in the financial statements and capitalised to mining assets on initial recognition.
Initial recognition is at the time of the disturbance occurring and thereafter as and when additional environmental disturbances are created.
The estimates are reviewed annually to take into account the effects of inflation and changes in estimates and are discounted using rates that reflect the time value of money.
Annual increases in the provision are charged to income and consist of finance costs relating to the change in Annual Report 2003 Randgold Resources 65 Notes to the Annual Financial Statements Continued present value of the provision and inflationary increases in the provision estimate.
The present value of additional environmental disturbances created are capitalised to mining assets against an increase in the rehabilitation provision.
The rehabilitation asset is amortised as noted previously.
Rehabilitation projects undertaken, included in the estimates, are charged to the provision as incurred.
Environmental liabilities, other than rehabilitation costs, which relate to liabilities arising from specific events, are expensed when they are known, probable and may be reasonably estimated.
PROVISIONS are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
GOLD SALES: Revenue arising from gold sales is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership and title pass to the buyer under the terms of the applicable contract and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
INTEREST is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the period to maturity.
DERIVATIVES: All derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, unless they meet the criteria for the normal purchases normal sales exemption.
On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Group designates the derivative for accounting purposes as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge.
Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are included in the income statement in the same periods during which the hedge firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects net profit or loss.
Recognition of derivatives which meet the criteria for own use are deferred until settlement.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement.
The Group formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
This process includes linking derivatives designed as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments for forecasted transactions.
The Group formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
PROVIDENT FUNDS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS: Provident funds, which are defined contribution plans, are funded through monthly contributions which are charged to income statement as incurred.
FINANCE LEASES: Leases of plant and equipment where the Company assumes substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership are classified as a finance lease.
Finance leases are capitalised at the estimated present value of the underlying lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and the finance charges to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The interest portion of the finance payment is charged to the income statement over the lease period.
The plant and equipment acquired under the finance lease are depreciated over the useful life of the assets.
INVESTMENTS: Investments are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Dividends are accounted for when declared in respect of unlisted investments.
On the disposal of an investment, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to the income statement.
INCOME AND MINING TAXES: The Group follows the comprehensive liability method of accounting for income and mining taxes, whereby deferred income and mining taxes are recognised for the tax consequences of timing differences, by applying current statutory tax rates to differences between financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for temporary differences which result in deductible amounts in future periods, but only to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which these differences can be utilised.
Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities include the impact of any tax rate changes enacted during the year.
EARNINGS PER SHARE is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
FULLY DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE is presented when the inclusion of potential ordinary shares has a dilutive effect on earnings per share.
66 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2003 3 Income and Mining Taxes The Company is not subject to income tax in Jersey.
Morila SA, benefits from a five year tax holiday in Mali.
The tax holiday of Morila SA expires on 1 November 2005.
The benefit of the tax holiday to the Company was to increase its net income by US$22.5 million and US$31.7 million, due to not recording its share of Morilas tax expense for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Accordingly, had the Company not benefited from the tax holiday in Mali, earnings per share would have been reduced by US$0.78 and US$1.26 million for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2002 respectively.
Thus, the tax accounting for the Group on a consolidated basis reflects the tax accounting for its suspended operation, Somisy.
Under Malian tax law, income tax is based on the greater of 35 per cent of taxable income or 0.75 per cent of gross revenue.
No tax charge for the periods included in suspended operations has accrued in 2003 and 2002, based on Malian tax law.

In 2003, the provision was reversed so as to carry the TSF stockpile at a cost of US$1.7 million 2002:US$1.9 million.
The provision was reversed in 2003 as management now has a detailed plan for the processing of the TSF, and began blending it in production during 2003.

The net book value of these assets was US$54.1 million as at 31 December 2003 2002:US$61.9 million.
SHORT-LIFE ASSETS Short-life assets are those assets which are amortised over their useful life and are comprised of motor vehicles and other equipment.
The net book value of these assets was US$9.0 million as at 31 December 2003 2002:US$4.9 million.
UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY Included in property, plant and equipment are undeveloped property costs of US$9.7 million 2002:US$9.7 million.
Accumulated depreciation is not adjusted upon recognition of an impairment charge, as by adjusting the impairment charge against the historical cost of property, plant and equipment, the net carrying value of property, plant and equipment is adjusted to its recoverable amount.

In terms of the life of mine plan, pre-stripping is performed in the earlier years.
This results in the cost associated with waste stripped at a rate higher than the expected pit life average stripping ratio, being deferred to those years.
These costs will be released in the period where the actual stripping ratio decreases to below such expected pit life ratio.
The expected pit life average stripping ratios used to calculate the deferred stripping were 3.68 in 2003 and 3.68 in 2002.
These stripping ratios were calculated taking into account the actual strip ratios achieved of 4.77 and 7.15 for 2003 and 2002 respectively.

Of this an amount of US$2.65 million was outstanding at 31 December 2002.
Under the settlement agreement the Company has paid US$1.3 million in December 2003 and will pay US$1.3 million in 2004.
The outstanding balance is disclosed under Note 14.

While the ultimate amount of rehabilitation costs to be incurred in the future is uncertain, the Group has estimated that the remaining costs for the Syama Mine, in current monetary terms, will be US$2.6 million.
The Company has entered into an option agreement with the Australian mining company, Resolute Mining Limited, over its interest in the Syama Mine in Mali.
In terms of the agreement, Resolute were given a 12 month period in which to conduct a full due diligence over Syama, which expires on the 17th April 2004.
Should this option be exercised, Resolute will assume the rehabilitation liability of Syama.
Current rehabilitation costs related to Morila are estimated to be US$12.3 million 2002:US$8.4 million, the majority of which will only be expended in eight years time.
Although limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali to govern the mines, management has based the environmental rehabilitation accrual using the standards as set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up to date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the Groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The Group is committed to rehabilitation of its properties and to ensure that it is adequately provided to do so it makes use of independent environmental consultants to advise it and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
There are no unasserted claims reflected in either of the provisions for Syama or Morila.
While the ultimate clean up costs may be uncertain, there are no uncertainties with respect to joint and several liability that may affect the magnitude of the contingency at either Syama or Morila as the extent of these obligations are clearly defined in their respective mining conventions.
The total cost of rehabilitation is estimated at US$14.9 million, US$2.6 million of which relates to Syama and will be spent within the next twelve months and US$12.3 million of which relates to Morila and the majority of which will only be spent after eight years.
There are no other potentially responsible parties to consider for cost sharing arrangements.
The Company carries insurance against pollution including cost of cleanup.
At present, there are no losses and or claims outstanding.

All or part of the interest due could be deferred if net cash available was insufficient to pay in full.
Deferred interest also incurred interest at the stated rate.
To date, no interest has been paid.
Interest has been waived by mutual agreement between the parties as of May 2001 due to the suspended status of the operation.
Under the terms of the loans, the minority shareholders have a binding agreement not to claim payment on these loans until they have made good their share of the acccumulated loss.
Unless there is net cash available at the loan settlement date, the loan will be discharged to the extent of the minority shareholders share of the accumulated losses.
15.2 Somilo The Government of Mali loan to Somilo is uncollateralised and bears interest at the base rate of the Central Bank of West African States plus 2%.
Losses of Somisy and Somilo have been attributed to the minority shareholders as their loans are not repayable until there is net cash available.
In the event of a liquidation of Somisy and Somilo the shareholders loans and deferred interest are not guaranteed.

20 Fair Value and Risks of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments are set out in note 21.
In the normal course of its operations, the Company is exposed to commodity price, currency, interest, liquidity and credit risk.
In order to manage these risks, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at their fair value on the balance sheet.
Annual Report 2003 Randgold Resources 77 Notes to the Annual Financial Statements Continued 20 Fair Value and Risks of Financial Instruments continued 20.1 Concentration of Credit Risk The Groups financial instruments do not represent a concentration of credit risk because the Group sells its gold to and deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed and an adequate level of provision for doubtful debt is maintained.
Gold bullion, the Group's principal product, is produced in Mali.
The gold produced is sold to reputable gold refineries.
Because of the international market for gold the Group believes that no concentration of credit risk exists with respect to the selected refineries to which the gold is sold.
20.2 Foreign Currency and Commodity Price Risk In the normal course of business, the Group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily EURO and Communaute Financire Africaine Franc.
As a result, the Group is subject to transaction exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Generally the Group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and sells at market spot prices.
These prices are in US dollars and do not expose the Group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the Company secures a floor price through simple forward contracts and options whilst maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
Approximately 15% of Morilas planned production has been sold forward for the year 2004.
20.3 Interest Rates and Liquidity Risk Fluctuation in interest rates impact on the value of short-term cash investments and financing activities including long-term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the Group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The Group has been able to in the past actively source financing through public offerings, shareholders loans and third party loans.
21 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2003 and 2002.
The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of the fair values because of the short maturity of such instruments.
LONG-TERM DEBT The fair value of market based floating rate long-term debt is estimated using the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates.
No fair value is determinable for the loans from minority shareholders as repayment is contingent on net available cash from the projects.
GOLD PRICE CONTRACTS The fair value of gold price forward and option contracts has been determined by reference to quoted market rates at year end balance sheet dates.
22 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 22.1 Capital Expenditure Contracts for capital expenditure 320 794 Authorised but not contracted for 148 73 468 867 23 Related Party Transactions Due to the Company not having a corporate presence in South Africa, a service agreement was entered into with Randgold & Exploration Company Limited which held between 28.57% and 42% of the Companys shares in 2003.

The attributable management fees for the year ended 31 December 2003 amounted to US$1.1 million 2002:US$1.3 million.
80 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2003 24 Pro Forma Information Total cash costs per ounce are calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute industry standard, by gold ounces produced for all periods presented.
The Gold Institute is a non-profit international association of miners, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers of gold products, which has developed a uniform format for reporting production costs on a per ounce basis.
The standard was first adopted in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institute standard, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from deferred stripping and royalties.
The transfer to and from deferred stripping is calculated based on the actual historical waste stripping costs, as applied to a life of mine estimated stripping ratio.
The costs of waste stripping in excess of the life of mine estimated stripping ratio, are deferred and charged to production, at the average historical cost of mining the deferred waste, when the actual stripping ratio is below the life of mine stripping ratio.
The net effect is to include a proportional share of total estimated stripping costs for the life of the mine, based on the current period ore mined.
We have calculated total cash costs on a consistent basis for all periods presented.
Total cash costs per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other International Financial Reporting Standards measures or an indicator of our performance.
While the Gold Institute has provided a definition from the calculation of total cash costs per ounce, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, we believe that total cash costs per ounce is a useful indicator to investors and management of a mining companys performance as it provides an indication of a companys profitability and efficiency, the trends in costs as the companys operation mature, a measure of a companys gross margin per ounce, by comparison of total cash costs per ounce to the spot price of gold, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
