Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions completed since 1 September 1998 is included within intangible xed assets and released to the profit and loss account in the periods in which the fair values of the non-monetary assets purchased on the same acquisition are recovered, whether through amortisation, depreciation or sale.
Goodwill is subject to impairment review in the year following acquisition and in subsequent years when the circumstances require it.
Such reviews are carried out in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11 impairment of xed assets and goodwill.

Cost includes all direct costs incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition, including in the case of the initial print run of books published by group subsidiary undertakings, the proportional allocation of all editorial, origination and printing costs relating to such stock.
Remainder stocks of books which have been held for more than one year are written off on a straight line basis over a twenty four month period to reect their diminishing net realisable value.

For these titles, the pre-publication costs are amortised over the useful lives of up to five years.
Leases Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible xed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss accounts on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Pension costs Pensions relating to current and past service are funded by annual contributions to the Chrysalis Group PLC Retirement Benets Scheme.

Bank loans and overdrafts falling due after more than one year include a net 51,627,000 in respect of amounts drawn down on a 60,000,000 securitisation loan facility.
The transaction is based upon the securitisation of the Groups worldwide music publishing catalogue and its related income stream or Net Publishers Share NPS.
The gross amount drawn down at 31 August 2003 of 54,000,000 2002:46,500,000 is stated net of 2,373,000 2002:2,562,000, which represents the unamortised issuance costs relating to the loan facility.
The issuance costs are being amortised over the 15 year period of the loan in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
The 60 million loan facility, which was put in place on 1 March 2001, is funded by Music Finance Corporation Inc. a special purpose vehicle company owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Plc based in the USA, which uses the US asset-backed commercial paper market to provide its capital on the basis of the underlying transaction structure, supported by a liquidity facility arranged by the Groups UK bankers.
Interest is payable twice yearly in March and September and is set with reference to prevailing rates in the US commercial paper market.
Taking account of a 6 million reserve facility, the loan is now fully drawn down.
The 15 year loan provides a exible repayment structure including a three year revolving period followed by the amortisation of 70% of the loan in two instalments per year, over a 12 year period.
The remaining balance of 30% is subject to a bullet repayment at the end of the term.

PAGE 52 Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 August 2003 25 Financial instruments and derivatives The Groups policies and strategies in relation to treasury management, risk and financial instruments are explained in the Finance Directors Review on pages 21 and 22.
All gures exclude current monetary assets and liabilities.
Accounting policies relevant to financial instruments are detailed in Note 1. i Currency and interest rate analysis As at 31 August 2003, the currency and interest rate prole of the Groups financial liabilities after offsetting 30,600,000 of cash deposits held with the same bank and taking into account the effect of interest rate collars were as follows: Floating rate Fixed rate liabilities liabilities Total 000 000 000 Sterling 57,592 1,622 59,215 European currencies 152 152 At 31st August 2003 57,744 1,622 59,366 Sterling 66,243 1,268 67,511 European currencies 146 146 At 31st August 2002 66,389 1,268 67,657 Floating rate borrowings bear interest with reference to bank rates and, in respect of the securitisation, to the prevailing rates in the US Commercial paper market.
The weighted average interest rate on xed rate borrowings is 10.41% 2002: 8.1% and the weighted average time for which the rate is xed was 1.75 years 2002: 1.7 years.
The maturity of the borrowings is shown in Note 21. ii Currency exposure As at 31st August 2003 the currency exposures of the Group were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Australian New Zealand Canadian Swedish Dollar Dollar Dollar Euro Krone US Dollar Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Functional currency of Group operations Sterling 138 3 233 5,143 249 7,507 13,273 Euro 120 120 At 31st August 2003 138 3 233 5,143 249 7,387 13,153 Sterling 1,036 128 363 790 379 8,328 11,024 Euro 123 123 At 31st August 2002 1,036 128 363 790 379 8,205 10,901 iii Comparison of book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities At 31st August 2003, the book value of interest rate collars used to manage the Groups interest rate exposure was nil 2002: nil.
The fair value of interest rate collars at 31st August 2003 indicated a technical deficit to the Group of 3,197,000 2002: 2,680,000 and arises because at the year end, the prevailing interest rate had fallen below the contractual oor rate in the collar.
The fair value was calculated by reference to prevailing market interest rates.
The book value of forward foreign exchange contracts at 31st August 2003 was nil 2002: nil and the fair value indicated a technical loss of 16,000 2002: surplus of 358,000.
Other than for interest rate collars and forward foreign exchange contracts as referred to previously, there is no material difference between the book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
iv Hedging At 31st August 2003 the Group held forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge foreign currency transactions arising from operations, and also royalty income used to repay securitisation borrowings.
The potential gain or loss on these contracts is not expected to be material to the Group.
No material gain or losses were experienced by the Group on such contracts during the year.

PAGE 56 Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 August 2003 32 Pension costs The UK Group operates a funded pension scheme with a final salary section and a dened contributions section.
The final salary section of the scheme was closed to new entrants after 1 July 1994.
Since that date, all eligible employees can choose to join the dened contribution section of the scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held under trust separately from the Companys assets, and are invested by external fund managers.
Contributions to the final salary section of the scheme are determined by a qualied actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
Contributions to the dened contributions section depend on the age of the employee.
The most recent actuarial valuation, as at 1 September 2002, showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 16,393,000 and the actuarial value of those assets represented 77% of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The deficit amounting to 4,975,000, which relates entirely to the final salary section of the scheme, is being funded by temporarily increased contributions by the Group of 393,000 per annum, in addition to the employers contribution rate of 24.2% for the remaining members of the final salary section of the scheme.
The key assumptions affecting the results of the 1st September 2002 valuation were: investment returns would be 5.0% per annum previously 7.5% per annum salary increases would average 3.5% per annum previously 5.5% per annum The pension charge for the year was 1,131,000 2002: 986,000, including 498,000 2002: 588,000 in respect of the amortisation of past service surpluses that are being recognised over the average remaining service lives of employees.
At 31st August 2003, the outstanding pension contributions relating to the final salary section of the Scheme were 59,637 2002: 69,279.
