qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 95 Supplementary information for United States investors Reconciliation with US GAAP The Groups financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP.
Basis of preparation The financial statements which are presented to comply with the Companies Act 1985 have been prepared using accounting policies which differ in certain respects to those used in the preparation of the financial information contained within the Listing Particulars of mmO plc 2 dated 18 September 2001 the Listing Particulars, the Form 20-F A Registration Statement dated 31 October 2001 the Form 20-F A and the Form 20-F for the year ended 31 March 2002 the Form 20-F.
In the Listing Particulars, Form 20-F A and Form 20-F, a portion of BTs shortand long-term loans and other borrowings were allocated to the Group.
The basis of preparation adopted for these financial statements, under UK GAAP, shows the results and financial position of the Group with no push-down allocations of loans and other borrowings.
Additional information regarding this treatment is provided in the Basis of preparation disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements.
Differences between accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and the United States of America The following are the main differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP which are relevant to the Groups financial statements.
a Capitalisation of interest Under UK GAAP, the Group does not capitalise interest in its financial statements.
To comply with US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in xed assets and depreciated over the lives of the related assets.
This includes capitalisation of interest incurred on funding the UMTS licences for the period up to the launch of the related services.
The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the average interest rates on outstanding borrowings and cannot exceed the annual interest expense charged.
As at 31 March 2003 under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest of 1,299 million 2002: 1,214 million was subject to depreciation generally over periods of five to 20 years.
b Goodwill and intangible assets Under UK GAAP, in respect of acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 1998, the Group wrote off goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition against Owners net investment.
The goodwill is reected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of the gain or loss on divestment to the extent it has not already been recognised in the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, such goodwill is held as an intangible asset in the balance sheet and was previously amortised over its useful life with only the unamortised portion being included in any gain or loss on divestment.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 1998 is amortised over its useful life.
In addition, under UK GAAP, contingent purchase consideration is generally included as part of the purchase cost at the date of acquisition.
Under US GAAP, this cost is not recognised until the contingency is resolved or the amount is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The Group adopted SFAS No.
142 requires the cessation of amortisation of intangible xed assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill.
Instead, such intangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or sooner should a triggering event occur.
Those intangible xed assets that have definite useful lives continue to be amortised over their useful life, with impairment reviews being carried out when triggering events occur.
Such definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
In considering whether a triggering event has occurred under SFAS No.
144, the Group looks for the existence of facts and circumstances, either internal or external, which indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.
Certain intangible xed assets recognised under US GAAP purchase accounting requirements are subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, these separately identied intangible assets are valued and amortised over their useful lives.
Under US GAAP, the Group separately identied intangible assets which arose on acquisition, other than goodwill, relating to customer bases, trademarks and tradenames, internally developed software, assembled workforce and licences.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
142, the net balance of 53 million for assembled workforce was transferred to goodwill and will no longer be subject to amortisation.
As of 1 April 2002, the Group performed the transitional impairment test under SFAS No.
142 and compared the carrying value for each reporting unit to its fair value, which was determined based on discounted cash ows.
Upon completion of the transitional impairment test, the Group determined that there was no transitional impairment as of 1 April 2002.
During the second half of the year ended 31 March 2003 certain trigger events indicated the Group should perform impairment reviews of its four principal reporting units: its mobile telecommunications operations in the UK, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands in accordance with SFAS No.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 96 Supplementary information for United States investors In April 2003, the Group announced the sale of O Netherlands resulting in an accounting loss of approximately 1.4 billion, which provided 2 an indication that the valuation of mobile businesses may be lower than previously estimated.
Additionally, following the Competition Commissions report on mobile termination charges, the Group announced that it was reviewing the launch dates of its 3G services and would adopt a more prudent timetable where local regulatory requirements permitted.
The revision in this timetable, together with the current absence of evidence as to the present mass market appeal of 3G services and the limited availability of 2G 3G compatible handsets, has led management to review and revise the business plans of its mobile operations across its European footprint.
As a result of the above events and in conjunction with the Groups annual impairment review under SFAS 142, the carrying value of the xed assets of O UK, O Germany and O Ireland and the goodwill that arose on their acquisition was reviewed.
In evaluating whether any 2 2 2 long-lived assets and intangibles were impaired, the undiscounted cash ows of O UK, O Germany and O Ireland were compared to their 2 2 2 carrying values.
To test the carrying value of goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit, based on the present value of future cash ows, was compared to the carrying value of the reporting units assets and liabilities.
Where the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value, the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognised intangible assets, was estimated in order to determine the implied value of goodwill.
Based on our analyses under US GAAP, the Group recorded charges of 409 million and 1,475 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill that arose on the acquisitions of O UK and O Ireland respectively.
2 2 Under UK GAAP the Group recorded an impairment of 8,300 million of the intangible assets relating to O UK, O Germany and O Ireland, 2 2 2 of which 2,401 million related to the impairment of goodwill and 5,899 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets.
The difference in the impairment charges is primarily as a result of the requirement under US GAAP to first test the carrying value of long-lived assets using undiscounted cash ows and secondarily the difference in methodology for calculating the impairment of goodwill.
As a result of the announced disposal of O Netherlands, the carrying values of the net assets of O Netherlands have been written down to 2 2 their net realisable amount, being the sale proceeds less direct costs of disposal.
This has resulted in an impairment charge of 1,424 million being recognised in the profit and loss account of which 684 million related to goodwill and 740 million related to long-lived assets.
The difference between the impairment charge recorded for US GAAP and UK GAAP in respect of O Netherlands is due to the different 2 carrying values of the net assets.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the segments and in total for the year ended 31 March 2003 are as follows: Mobile telecommunications Other UK Germany Other businesses Total m m m m m Balance at 31 March 2002 2,820 605 2,397 5 5,827 Impairment charges 409 2,159 2,568 Foreign exchange and other movements 126 310 436 Balance at 31 March 2003 2,411 731 548 5 3,695 The following table represents the components of amortisable intangible assets for US GAAP purposes as of 31 March 2003: Gross carrying Accumulated Gross carrying Accumulated amount amortisation amount amortisation 2003 2002 m m m m Licences 10,489 423 9,690 Other intangible assets 519 302 522 235 11,008 723 10,212 235 96 mmO plc 2003 2 mmO2 AR pp065-110.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 97 The following table presents current and expected amortisation expense for other identiable intangible assets for the current year and the subsequent five years.
Amount m Aggregate amortisation expense for the year ended 31 March: 2003 37 Expected amortisation expense for the year ending 31 March: 2004 165 2005 579 2006 579 2007 579 2008 579 The above table represents the Groups estimate regarding future amortisation of amortisable intangible assets recorded on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2003.
Due to the effects of foreign exchange, any future investments or capital expenditure on intangible assets, and the date on which the assets are likely to be put into service, it is likely that the actual charge will be different.
As at 31 March 2003, the gross carrying value of goodwill under US GAAP was 10,257 million 2002: 9,412 million.
c Software impairment In 2001, O Germany wrote off certain software related to the integration of the xed and mobile business units that were abandoned as a 2 result of the split of the mobile and xed line businesses of Viag Interkom.
Under US GAAP, the software abandonment is treated as a purchase price allocation adjustment for the portion acquired on 20 February 2001.
The portion owned by the Group prior to the February acquisition is expensed at the acquisition date.
Under UK GAAP, the entire amount of software is written off subsequent to the purchase after BT has attained full control of the entity and commenced the reorganisation of Viag Interkom.
The adjustment presented reverses the expense recorded under UK GAAP related to the purchase price adjustment.
The corresponding effect on shareholders funds of the software write-off increases the recognised goodwill.
d Employee share plans Share options have been granted under the mmO Sharesave Plan at a 20 per cent discount to the market price of the date of grant.
2 Under UK GAAP, the share issues are recorded at their discounted price when the options are exercised.
Under US GAAP, a plan is considered compensatory when the discount to market price is in excess of 15 per cent.
Compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the measurement date the grant date in this case and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
Additionally, certain shares have been awarded to a small group of executives under the mmO Restricted Share Plan on the basis that they 2 will only vest if participants build up a pre-determined personal shareholding in the Group.
Under US GAAP an expense is only recognised where it can be reasonably assured that the executive will build up the required personal shareholding and such an expense is recognised over the vesting period.
The Groups potentially dilutive share options are anti-dilutive and therefore, in accordance with US GAAP, are not included in the computation of weighted average shares used in computing the diluted loss per share.
e Investments accounted for under the equity method 1 Additional US GAAP adjustments to equity method investments Under UK GAAP, certain joint ventures and associates have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
For the purposes of this reconciliation, adjustments have been made to restate net loss and shareholders funds of these associates to US GAAP.
The only material reconciling item is capitalised interest, which reduced US GAAP net loss by nil for the year ended 31 March 2003 2002: nil, 2001: 66 million.
This adjustment is reected in the capitalised interest reconciling line item.
2 Change in the reporting period of a subsidiary Under UK GAAP, the additional reporting period, or lag time, resulting from a parent changing a subsidiarys year end is included in the income statement.
Under US GAAP, the results from this period are treated as a direct adjustment to retained earnings.
The amount included in the US GAAP reconciliation of net loss relates to the O Germany equity loss pick-up for the three-month period 1 January 2000 through 2 31 March 2000 included in the UK GAAP profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2001. f Other employee compensation expense Under UK GAAP certain amounts paid and payable to former owners of purchased companies who are also employees are included as part of the acquisition cost of these companies.
Under US GAAP, where payment of those amounts is based on achievement of certain performance goals, they qualify as employee compensation expense and are recognised in the financial statements when the performance goals are met.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 98 Supplementary information for United States investors g Restructuring costs The Group recognised a restructuring charge related to employee termination benets and real estate closures.
This plan called for the reduction of over 1,900 positions in the technical, retail and administrative departments of O UK and O Germany.
Under US GAAP, site closure costs 2 2 can only be recognised for the period post cessation of operations at that site, whereas under UK GAAP the provision may be recognised at the time of managements commitment, communication and reasonable estimate of the associated cost.
As of 31 March 2002, approximately 650 employees had been terminated, with all other terminations and associated closures occurring in the year ended 31 March 2003. h Treasury stock In the year ended 31 March 2003, mmO Employee Share Trust purchased 2 million shares on the stock market for 1 million year ended 31 2 March 2002, 6 million shares for 4 million.
Under UK GAAP these shares have been classied as a xed asset investment and a charge of 2 million 2002: 1 million has been recognised for stock compensation.
Under US GAAP such shares are classied as treasury stock and are included as a deduction in shareholders funds.
This treasury stock has been accounted for under the cost method.
i Derivative financial instruments Under UK GAAP certain derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting which do not qualify for hedge accounting under US GAAP.
The financial instruments, under US GAAP, are carried at market value with valuation adjustments recorded in the profit and loss account.
j Notional loans due to BT As at 31 March 2000 and 2001, 3 billion and 16.8 billion of notional debt, including accrued interest, was allocated to the Group, representing the borrowings raised by BT to fund the Groups major mobile acquisitions, including UMTS licences.
These loans had a deemed average annual interest rate of 6.9 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively, which resulted in 90 million and 660 million of interest being notionally charged to the Group in the years ended 31 March 2000 and 2001 respectively.
Notional interest of 756 million was recognised under US GAAP for the period from 1 April 2002 to demerger.
The effect of this interest charge on the deferred tax has been included in the deferred tax effect of US GAAP adjustments below.
k Deferred tax effect of US GAAP adjustments As at 31 March 2003, the adjustment of 278 million 2002: 102 million reconciling shareholders funds under UK GAAP to the amount under US GAAP included the tax effect of US GAAP adjustments.
This comprises an adjustment to increase non-current assets by 742 million 2002: 74 million increase and increase long-term liabilities by 1,020 million 2002: 176 million increase.
l Long-term licence creditors In the year ended 31 March 2003, O Ireland purchased a UMTS B licence.
The total licence fee is 114 million phased over 15 years.
2 Under US GAAP the asset cost has been recorded at the discounted present value of the phased payments and a corresponding creditor established.
Over the 15 year period the creditor will be accreted in order to recognise the full 114 million due.
Under UK GAAP the asset and creditor have been recognised at their undiscounted value.
m Pension liability Due to the different methods of calculating pension liabilities, the pension scheme deficit calculated under UK GAAP using FRS 17 differs from the calculation under SFAS No.
In 2003, a minimum liability relating to certain pension plans has been recognised in other comprehensive income under US GAAP, whereas this balance is not provided for under UK GAAP, but included as a disclosure item only.
n Foreign exchange The Group carries a significant portion of its net assets in Euros.
The foreign exchange adjustment reects the retranslation of US GAAP adjustments which are Euro denominated.
Net loss and owners net investment reconciliation The following statements summarise the material estimated adjustments, which reconcile net loss and owners net investment shareholders funds from that reported under UK GAAP to that which would have been reported had US GAAP been applied.
2003 2002 2001 Net loss Note m m m Net loss under UK GAAP 10,148 850 3,533 Adjustment for: Capitalisation of interest, net of related depreciation a 67 579 344 Goodwill impairment b 482 Licence impairment b 5,899 Fixed asset impairment on discontinuing operations b 25 Goodwill amortisation b 374 23 19 Mobile licences, software and other intangible assets b 37 217 98 Software impairment c 12 Employee share plans d 1 1 8 Equity investments: adjustment for change in reporting period e 51 Other employee compensation expense f 3 8 Restructuring costs g 21 21 Fair value of derivatives i 50 19 Notional loans due to BT j 756 660 Deferred taxation on US GAAP differences k 176 240 134 Long-term licence creditors l 1 Net loss as adjusted for US GAAP 3,671 1,463 3,747 Basic and diluted net loss per share, as adjusted for US GAAP pence 42.3 16.9 2003 2002 Shareholders funds Note m m Net assets under UK GAAP 10,066 18,834 Adjustment for: Capitalisation of interest, net of related depreciation a 912 979 Goodwill impairment b 435 Licence impairment b 5,899 Fixed asset impairment on discontinuing operations b 25 Purchase business combinations and amortisation of intangible assets b 69 268 Employee share plans d 4 3 Other employee compensation expense f 11 11 Restructuring costs g 21 Treasury stock h 3 3 Fair value of derivatives i 31 19 Deferred taxation on US GAAP differences k 278 102 Long-term licence creditors l 1 Pension liability m 38 Foreign exchange n 7 Net assets as adjusted for US GAAP 17,045 19,428 Had the cessation of goodwill amortisation requirement of SFAS No.

qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 100 Supplementary information for United States investors The net loss under UK GAAP has been prepared for statutory reporting purposes using accounting policies which differ in certain respects to those used in the Listing Particulars, Form 20-F A and Form 20-F.
The impact of the different accounting policies is set out below: 2003 2002 2001 m m m Net loss on Form 20-F basis 10,148 1,379 4,009 Notional loans due to BT 756 660 Deferred taxation on US GAAP differences 227 184 Net loss under UK GAAP for UK statutory reporting purposes 10,148 850 3,533 The above adjustments have no impact on the net loss as adjusted for US GAAP.
Accounting for stock options Under UK GAAP, the cost of shares expected to be awarded under each plan is amortised evenly over the period from the original date of grant of the particular award, to the time of vesting.
Under US GAAP, the Group adopted the disclosure-only option in SFAS No.
Accordingly, the Group accounts for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which compensation expense is recognised to the extent that the fair market value of the shares optioned exceeds the option exercise price.
Aggregate share compensation of 3 million 2002: 2 million has been recognised under APB No.
A charge of 2 million was recognised under UK GAAP.
Share option and purchase schemes The Group operates savings-related share option schemes for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries and further share option schemes the mmO Share Option Plan and the mmO Legacy Option Plan for selected Group employees.
2 2 Sharesave Plan The mmO Sharesave Plan is a savings-related share option scheme available to all employees.
Share options are normally exercisable on 2 completion of a three-year or five-year Save-As-You-Earn contract.
Under this scheme, the option exercise price is set at a 20 per cent discount to the market price at the date of grant.
Similar savings related schemes exist for Group employees based outside the UK.
mmO Share Option Plan 2 From 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003, options were granted for nil consideration to 1,041 employees.
All such options have an exercise price equal to the market value at grant date.
These options were granted on the terms that they normally only become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant, subject to certain performance criteria.
If these criteria are not met on the third anniversary of grant, the performance goals will be retested on the fourth and fifth anniversaries.
Options under this scheme generally have a life of ten years.
mmO Legacy Option Plan 2 Subsisting options over BT shares granted under BT executive share option plans have been replaced with options over mmO shares, granted 2 under the Legacy Option Plan, for those participants now employed by mmO.
The replacement options were granted on the same terms, 2 and are exercisable between the same dates, as the options for which they were exchanged.
Options are normally exercisable up until the tenth anniversary of the date of the original grant.
The exercise price of these options equalled the market value as at original grant date.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 101 Options outstanding in relation to Group employees under these share option schemes as at 31 March 2003 together with their exercise prices and vesting periods, were as follows: Options outstanding over Options exercisable over ordinary shares ordinary shares Weightedaverage Weighted Weightedremaining average average Number contractual exercise Number exercise outstanding life price exercisable price 1 Range of exercise prices m years m 0.44 37 3 0.44 0.46 77 9 0.46 0.48-0.69 13 9 0.65 3 0.69 0.73-0.84 8 2 0.73 1 0.83 0.87 46 9 0.87 3 0.87 0.91-2.29 5 7 1.36 2 1.64 186 8 0.60 9 1.02 1 Share options over American Depositary Shares ADS have exercise prices termed in US Dollars.
For purposes of disclosure, these options exercise prices have been translated into Sterling at the year end exchange rate.
As each ADS represents 10 ordinary shares, the number of options and exercise prices have been adjusted by this ratio to reect the options on a like for like basis.
Options granted, exercised and lapsed in respect of Group employees under these share option schemes during the years ended 31 March 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Options over ordinary shares Options over ADSs 1 2 Ordinary shares ADSs  Other average Other average share share exercise share exercise options options price options price 1 Range of exercise prices m m m Balance at 31 March 2000 55 2 1.05 Granted 10 2 1.82 Exercised 11 1 0.77 Lapsed 4 1.50 Balance at 31 March 2001 50 3 1.37 Lapsed on demerger 50 3 1.37 Balance on demerger Granted 31 65 0.82 6 1.17 Lapsed 2 0.84 Balance at 31 March 2002 31 63 0.82 6 1.17 Granted 37 81 0.45 Lapsed 23 6 0.72 3 0.87 Balance at 31 March 2003 45 138 0.60 3 1.49 1 All options granted, exercised, lapsed and outstanding for periods prior to demerger have been adjusted to reect the exchange ratio of 4.1266 shares of mmO per share of BT.
2 2 Share options over ADSs have exercise prices termed in US Dollars.
mmO Restricted Share Plan 2 Restricted share awards have been granted to a small group of senior executives.
Most of these awards were granted on terms that they will normally only vest on the third anniversary of grant if the participant builds up a pre-determined personal shareholding in the Group, and remains in employment with the Group.
Shares required to satisfy these awards are held in trust during the restricted period.
In accordance with APB No.
25, an expense has been recognised to the extent that executives have commenced building their personal shareholding.
The weighted average grant date fair value of the 9.4 million shares granted under this plan in the year ended 31 March 2002 was 0.80.
No shares were granted under this plan in the year ended 31 March 2003. www.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 102 Supplementary information for United States investors For disclosure purposes, the fair value of all share options granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used for share options granted by the Group: 2003 2002 2001 % %% Annual dividends 2 Expected volatility 27 55 40 Risk free interest rate 4 57 The expected life applied in the model anticipated the life of options extending one month later than the first exercise date.
Had compensation expense been determined on the basis of fair value pursuant to SFAS No.
123, net loss and net loss per share would have been as follows: 2003 2002 2001 in millions, except per share data which is stated in pence Net loss As reported 3,671 1,463 3,747 Pro forma 3,676 1,463 3,750 Net loss per share As reported 42.3 16.9 Pro forma 42.4 16.9 The weighted average fair value of share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2003 was nil 2002: 0.16 for options exercisable one year after the date of grant, nil 2002: 0.22 for options exercisable two years after the date of grant, 0.13 2002: 0.35, 2001: 0.80 for options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 0.23 2002: 0.46, 2001: 1.03 for options exercisable five years after the date of grant.
BT Legacy Share Awards A number of key employees of mmO were participants prior to demerger in BT share plans.
The awards have been adjusted so that they 2 relate solely to mmO plc shares, and any performance measure has been translated into a measure of the Groups performance from 2 demerger to the end of the performance period.
On maturity these awards will be satisfied in existing mmO shares held by an employee 2 trust which has already been funded by BT.
In accordance with the rules of these plans the awards were converted into awards over mmO plc shares on the basis of an adjustment 2 factor of 4.1266.
Incentive Share Plan, ISP and Retention Share Plan, RSP Participants are awarded shares which will normally vest at the end of a three-year period provided a pre-determined total shareholder return, TSR, target is met.
Executive Share Plan, ESP Participants are awarded shares which will normally vest at the end of five years provided a pre-determined TSR target is met.
Deferred Bonus Plan, DBP Awards of shares were made to executives based on their performance in the preceding financial year and vest after three years.
Under the DBP there are no associated performance goals.
Under the Separation Agreement between the Group and BT, it has been endorsed and agreed that all share awards required under the ISP, RSP, ESP and DBP will be honoured by BT and will be satisfied by issuance of existing mmO shares held by a BT trust which has already been 2 funded by BT.
Thus, the Group is not responsible for any of the options or shares under these schemes and will bear no compensation expense in association with them.
Group cash ow statements Under UK GAAP, the Group cash ow statement is presented in accordance with FRS 1 Cash ow statements.
The statements prepared under FRS 1 present substantially the same information as that required under SFAS No.
95, cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Under FRS 1, cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and overnight deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Under FRS 1, cash ows are presented for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, dividends paid to the Companys shareholders, management of liquid resources and nancing.
95 requires a classication of cash ows as resulting from operating, investing and nancing activities.
Cash ows under FRS 1 in respect of interest received, interest paid and taxation would be included within operating activities under SFAS No.
Cash ows from purchases, sales and maturities of trading securities, while not separately identied under UK GAAP, would be included within operating activities under US GAAP.
The following statements summarise the combined cash ow statements as if they had been presented in accordance with US GAAP, and include the adjustments that reconcile cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP to cash at bank and in hand reported under UK GAAP.

Under UK GAAP and US GAAP multi-employer accounting was applied to the Groups participation in the BTPS.
This applied until the inception of the mmO PP on 1 July 2002 for which the Group is the principal employer.
The cost for the period from 1 2 April 2002 to 30 June 2002 equals the contributions paid to the BTPS of 4 million and is in addition to the costs shown below.
For the Groups other arrangements, the difference between UK GAAP and US GAAP is not significant.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 104 Supplementary information for United States investors The net benefit expense for the year ended 31 March 2003 for the Groups dened benefit pension schemes in aggregate may be analysed as follows: 2003 m Service cost 17 Interest cost on benefit obligation 13 Expected return on plan assets 15 Net amortisation and deferral recognised losses 1 Net periodic benefit cost 16 Dened contribution cost 4 Net benefit expense 20 The funded status of the Groups pension schemes at 31 March 2003 was: 2003 m benefit obligation at end of year 310 Fair value of plan assets 218 Plan assets below benefit obligation 92 Unrecognised net loss 82 Net amount recognised 10 Comprising: benefit provision including additional minimum liability 48 Amount recognised through accumulated other comprehensive income 38 Net amount recognised 10 2003 m Change in additional minimum liability before tax: Accrued pension benefit expense 38 Other comprehensive income before tax 38 The change in the benefit obligation and the plan assets of the Groups pension schemes in the year ended 31 March 2003 may be analysed as follows: 2003 m benefit obligation at start of year 298 Service cost 17 Interest cost 13 Contributions by plan participants 8 Actuarial gains 26 benefit obligation at end of year 310 Fair value of plan assets at start of year 250 Actual return on plan assets 56 Contributions by plan participants 8 Contributions by employer 16 Fair value of plan assets at end of year 218 104 mmO plc 2003 2 mmO2 AR pp065-110.

Additional US GAAP disclosures a Investments Under UK GAAP, the Group accounts for joint venture investments using the gross equity method of accounting.
The profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the operating profit and loss, interest income or expense and attributable taxation of those companies.
The balance sheet shows the Groups share of the gross assets and liabilities of those companies and attributed goodwill.
Under US GAAP, these investments would be accounted for using the net equity method.
The profit and loss account would include on one line an item with the Groups share of the loss before tax of nil 2002: nil, 2001: 374 million.
The balance sheet would show on one line an item with the Groups share of the net assets of those companies.
b Exceptional items Under UK GAAP exceptional costs totalling 8,300 have been recognised 2002: 150 million: 2001: 2,821 million.
Under US GAAP these would not be considered exceptional items and would be classied within net operating expenses.
c Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
d Recent US GAAP Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
143, Accounting for Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for the Group from 1 April 2003.
143 requires, among other things, that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the Group has a legal obligation to do so.
A legal obligation can result from i a government action, such as a law or ordinance, ii an agreement between entities, such as a written or oral contract, or iii a promise conveyed to a third party that imposes a reasonable expectation of performance upon the promisor under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 106 Supplementary information for United States investors The associated asset retirement costs are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.
The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense as depreciation or impairment over the useful life of the related long-lived asset.
The liability is discounted and subsequently accreted using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate in effect when the liability was initially recognised.
The accretion amounts must be recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and classied in the statement of income as other operating expense.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this statement on its financial position, results of operations and cash ows.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognised and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred.
Previously a liability for an exit cost was required to be recognised at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan, however, this does not, by itself, create a present obligation to others that meets the denition of a liability.
146 will be effective for the Group for any exit or disposal activities that are initiated after 31 December 2002.
The Group does not anticipate adoption of this statement having a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations and cash ows.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.
FIN 45 requires that a liability at fair value be recorded in the guarantors balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee.
In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entitys product warranty liabilities.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modied after 31 December 2002, irrespective of the guarantors scal year-end.
The disclosure but not the accounting requirements of FIN 45 are effective for the Groups 2003 financial statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51.
FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneciary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after 31 January 2003.
For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to 1 February 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after 15 June 2003.
The disclosure but not the accounting requirements of FIN 46 are effective for the Groups 2003 financial statements, regardless of the date on which the variable interest entity was created.
Management is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on Issue 00-21 EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
EITF 00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities.
EITF 00-21 will be effective for interim periods beginning after 15 June 2003.
The Group is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of EITF 00-21 on its financial position and results of operations in 2003. e Recent UK accounting standards The Group continues to apply the transitional disclosure arrangements set out in FRS 17 Retirement benets.
Mandatory implementation is not required by the Group until the year ended 31 March 2006.
The transitional disclosures required are provided in note 8 to the financial statements.
The changes introduced by FRS 17 principally affect the way dened benefit pension schemes are accounted for.
At each yearend the pension scheme assets should be measured at market value while pension scheme liabilities should be measured at a present value using a specified actuarial valuation method and discounted at a corporate bond rate.
The resulting pension scheme surplus or deficit must be shown on the Groups balance sheet, and could be volatile because of the dependence on market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Taxation The following discussion is a general summary of certain material UK tax and US federal income tax considerations under present law relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs.
It applies only if you are a US holder as dened below, you hold our shares or ADSs as capital assets and you use the US dollar as your functional currency.
It does not address the tax treatment of US holders subject to special rules, such as banks, dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark to market, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, holders of ten per cent or more of our voting shares, persons holding our shares or ADSs as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or constructive sale transaction and persons that are resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.
This summary does not consider your particular circumstances.
It is not a substitute for tax advice.
We urge you to consult your own tax advisers about the particular tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances of ownership of our shares or ADSs.
As used in this discussion, US holder means a beneficial owner of our shares or ADSs that is i a US citizen or resident, ii a corporation or certain other business entities organised under US law, iii a trust subject to the control of a US person and the primary supervision of a US court or iv an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 107 UK taxation Dividends No tax is required to be withheld at source from dividends paid on our shares or ADSs.
See US Federal Income Taxation Dividends.
Dispositions Except as discussed below, you will not be liable for tax on capital gains realised on your disposal of our shares or ADSs unless you are resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, or you carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency in the UK for years in which your disposal occurs and our shares or ADSs are or have been used, held or acquired for the purposes of such trade or profession or vocation, branch or agency.
If you are an individual who has been resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom during the five years before you disposed of our shares or ADSs, you are likely to be liable for tax on capital gains if you return to the United Kingdom, subject to any available exemption or relief.
UK inheritance tax Our ordinary shares will be assets situated, and our ADSs are likely to be assets situated, in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the UK inheritance tax.
Subject to the discussion of the UK-US estate tax treaty in the next paragraph, UK inheritance tax may apply if you hold our shares or ADSs, and you gift them or die even if you are neither domiciled nor deemed to be domiciled in the United Kingdom.
If you transfer our shares or ADSs at less than full market value, you may be treated as making a gift.
Special rules apply to gifts if the donor retains some benefit, to close companies, and to trustees of settlements.
If your domicile is in the United States for purposes of the UK-US estate tax treaty and you are not a UK national, you will not be subject to UK inheritance tax if you die or gift our shares or ADSs unless our shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment or pertain to a UK xed base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal services.
The UK-US estate tax treaty provides a credit mechanism if our shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to the US federal estate or gift tax.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax, or SDRT, are generally payable upon the issue and deposit of our shares with the depository or its nominee in exchange for our ADSs evidenced by ADRs.
The current rate of stamp duty and SDRT imposed on these issues and transfers is 1.5 per cent applied, in each case, to the value of the consideration or, in some circumstances, to the value of our shares.
The stamp duty or SDRT is payable by the depository.
In accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement holders of our ADRs must reimburse the depository for the stamp duty or SDRT.
No such SDRT or stamp duty will however arise from the issuance and deposit of our shares pursuant to the scheme of arrangement.
No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of our ADRs if the instrument of transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and remains outside the United Kingdom.
Transfer of our ADRs will not give rise to a liability for SDRT.
A transfer of our shares by the depository to an ADR holder where there is no change in beneficial ownership will result in UK stamp duty at the rate of 5 per transfer.
Transfers of our shares to persons other than the depository or its nominee will give rise to UK stamp duty or SDRT at the time of transfer or agreement to transfer, normally at the rate of 0.5 per cent rounded up, in the case of stamp duty, to the nearest 5 of the amount payable for our shares.
The purchaser usually pays SDRT or UK stamp duty.
If our shares are later transferred to the depository, additional UK stamp duty or SDRT will normally be payable as described above.
US Federal Income Taxation If the obligations contemplated by the deposit agreement are performed in accordance with their terms, holders of our ADSs generally will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as the owners of our shares represented by those ADSs.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 108 Supplementary information for United States investors Dividends Dividends generally will be included in your gross income as ordinary income from foreign sources.
The dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction available to corporations.
Dividends paid in pounds sterling will be includible in income in a US dollar amount based on the exchange rate in effect on the date received by the depository in the case of our ADSs or the holder in the case of our shares whether or not the payment is converted into US dollars at that time.
Any gain or loss you recognise on a subsequent conversion of pounds sterling for a different amount generally will be US source ordinary income or loss.
If you hold our shares or ADSs and you are eligible for benets under the UK-US income tax treaty that was entered into force on 25 April 1980 the 1980 Convention, you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit for UK withholding tax.
The amount of the foreign tax credit equals the tax credit payment that you are entitled to receive from the UK Inland Revenue.
At current rates, a dividend of 90 entitles an eligible US holder to a Treaty payment of 10 which is completely offset by a UK withholding tax of 10.
Because the tax credit payment and the withholding tax offset each other, the UK Inland Revenue neither makes the payment nor collects the tax.
The offsetting payments nevertheless have US tax signicance.
If you elect the benets of the 1980 Convention, you must include the tax credit payment in your income and you can claim a foreign tax credit for the UK withholding tax subject to otherwise applicable limitations on foreign tax credit claims.
To make the election, you must le a completed US Internal Revenue Service Form 8833 with your US federal income tax return for the relevant year.
You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the advisability of claiming the foreign tax credit, including the limitations associated therewith and any alternatives available to you.
Us holders should be aware that a new United Kingdom United States Income Tax Convention entered into force on 31 March 2003 the New Convention and generally will have effect in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 May 2003.
Certain articles in the New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US holder to claim benets under the New Convention while similar provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention.
Under the New Convention there will be no hypothetical Treaty payment and no notional UK withholding tax applied to a dividend.
Therefore, it will not generally be possible for US holders to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any dividend paid by us on or after 1 May 2003.
However, a US holder entitled to benets under the 1980 Convention may elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue for an additional twelve months if the election to apply the 1980 Convention would result in greater benets to the holder.
If a US holder were to make an effective election, the discussion above with respect to dividends subject to the 1980 Convention would continue to apply to dividends paid by us prior to 1 May 2004.
US holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether the US holder is eligible for benets under the 1980 Convention and the New Convention, whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from us, and whether it may be advisable in light of the US holders particular circumstances to elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in force until 1 May 2004.
Recent US tax legislation generally has reduced the rate of US tax imposed on capital gains realized on or after 6 May 2003 and for dividends received on or after 1 January 2003.
US holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the impact of the 2003 tax legislation on their particular situations.
Dispositions You will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of our shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between adjusted tax or loss generally will be treated as arising from US sources.
A US holder that receives pounds sterling on the sale or other disposition of our shares will realise an amount equal to the US dollar value of the pounds sterling on the date of sale or, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement date.
A US holder will have a tax basis in the pounds sterling received equal to the US dollar amount realised.
Any gain or loss realised on a subsequent conversion of the pounds sterling for a different amount generally will be US source ordinary income or loss.
US Information reporting and backup withholding Dividend payments made to holders of shares or ADSs and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of shares or ADSs may be subject to information reporting requirements and US federal backup withholding tax at a current rate of 28 per cent.
Certain exempt persons such as corporations are not subject to these information reporting requirements.
Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identication number or certicate of foreign status and makes any other required certication or who is otherwise exempt from the backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holders US federal income tax liability, and a holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by ling the appropriate claim for refund with the US Internal Revenue Service and furnishing any required information.
