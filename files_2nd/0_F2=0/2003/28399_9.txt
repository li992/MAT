As required by that standard, the statement aggregates the cash flows arising from each division within the group.
However, the cash and investments held by those businesses that are regulated are required to be strictly segregated from those of the rest of the group and are not available to repay group borrowings.
At 31 December 2003 the cash and investments held by the groups regulated businesses amounted to 508.7m 2002 514.7m.
Liquid resources consist of bank and building society deposits that have a term of one year or less to maturity when acquired.

They have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the valuation of land and buildings at 31 December 1994.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the accounts of the company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the end of the financial year.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired and sold during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the dates of acquisition or to the dates of disposal.
Inter-company sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation and all sales and profit figures relate to external transactions only.
Turnover Turnover, which excludes value added tax and intra-group transactions, comprises revenue earned for the home credit businesses, premiums written net of reinsurance costs for the motor insurance underwriting business and revenue earned by Yes Car Credit on the sale of motor vehicles and associated finance and insurance contracts.
Revenue recognition In the home credit businesses the fixed charge payable by the customer on the amount of credit advanced is included in the customers account balance at the inception of the instalment credit agreement and is credited as revenue earned to the profit and loss account as follows: i at the inception of the agreement, the profit and loss account is credited with a proportion of revenues to cover the cost of initial expenses: ii the balance of revenue remaining is carried forward in the balance sheet as deferred revenue, to be credited to the profit and loss account in future periods.
A proportion of this deferred revenue, equating to the cost of financing the amount advanced is credited to the profit and loss account in future periods on the sum of the digits method and the balance is credited proportionately to collections received.
In respect of the motor insurance underwriting business, credit is taken to the profit and loss account for premium income, net of commissions paid to intermediaries, over the life of the policy.
In the car finance business of Yes Car Credit revenue from the sale of the motor vehicle is recognised in the profit and loss account when the vehicle is sold.
Finance income is recognised as revenue earned in the profit and loss account over the life of the contract to which it relates so as to give a constant rate of return and deferred revenue is included in car finance receivables.
A portion of the net commissions from arranging insurance between customers and third party insurers is recognised as revenue immediately on the inception of the related car finance contract.
The balance is spread over the life of the associated contract in line with the outstanding credit risk.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition, being the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life which, for all acquisitions, has been estimated to be 20 years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the introduction of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets is eliminated against reserves.
On the subsequent disposal or closure of a business, goodwill previously eliminated against reserves is charged to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at invoiced cost or valuation.
On adoption of FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets, the group followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of land and buildings at 31 December 1999 which were revalued in 1994 but decided not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software are capitalised.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the assets to their estimated realisable value over their useful lives.
The following are the principal bases used: %Method Land Nil 1 Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2 2 Straight line Short leasehold buildings Over the lease period Straight line Fixtures and fittings 10 Straight line 1 Equipment, including computers and capitalised software 20 to 33 3 Straight line Motor vehicles 25 Reducing balance 66 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Principal accounting policies continued Investment in own shares Shares in the company held by the QUEST are shown at their estimated recoverable amount, being the option price of the shares payable by employees.
The amount contributed to the QUEST in excess of the option price is charged against reserves.
Own shares held which are deemed to have suffered a permanent diminution in value are immediately written down to their realisable amount.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes Revised 2000 in respect of accounting for its employee savings-related share option schemes which states that the requirements of the Abstract need not be applied to such schemes.
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill Fixed assets and goodwill are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
Any impairment is recognised in the profit and loss account, or revaluation reserve, as appropriate, in the year in which it occurs.
Stock Stock comprises motor vehicles held for resale and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes transport and handling costs.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts In the home credit businesses, provision is made for all doubtful debts based on formulae which reflect the historical performance of the various categories of delinquent debtors or on the expected performance where there is insufficient historical experience.
The relevant proportion is appropriated from deferred revenue and the balance from the profit and loss account.
Full provision is made for any outstanding customer balance for which no payment has been received in the preceding 12 weeks.
Debts are written off when all reasonable steps to recover them have been taken without success.
In Yes Car Credit, provision is made for doubtful debts to reflect the directors best estimate of the number of contracts that are likely to default over the full term of each contract normally four years and the expected average loss on each contract.
Investments Deposits with financial institutions are stated at cost.
Fixed interest securities which are generally held to maturity are valued at amortised cost.
The amortisation is calculated so as to write off the difference between the purchase price and the maturity value over the life of the security.
Gains and losses on disposals of investments are dealt with in the profit and loss account when realised.
Provision for unpaid insurance claims Provision is made at the year end for the estimated gross cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date, including the gross cost of claims expected to be incurred but not yet reported to the company.
The estimated cost of claims comprises expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries.
Provisions are calculated gross of any reinsurance recoveries.
The company takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate information regarding its claims exposures.
However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims provisions, it is likely that the outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established.
The estimated cost of claims is calculated by reference to the projected number of claims, based on statistics showing how the number of notified claims has developed over time, and the anticipated average cost per claim, based on historical levels adjusted to allow for changes in variables such as legislation, inflation rates, the mix of business and industry benchmarks.
The provision for estimated insurance claims is reviewed annually by an external actuary.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers An asset is recognised in respect of amounts recoverable from reinsurers to reflect expected recoveries from reinsurers relating to insurance claims made and estimated claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
An assessment of the recoverability of reinsurance debtors is made having regard to market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies and provision is made for amounts deemed to be irrecoverable.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is determined using the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation is not recognised on revalued assets unless there is a binding agreement at the balance sheet date to sell the revalued asset and the related gain has been recognised in the accounts.
Deferred taxation balances are not discounted.
67 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Principal accounting policies continued Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pension scheme arrangements Contributions to separately administered defined benefit pension funds are charged to the profit and loss account to spread the costs of pensions over the employees working lives in line with SSAP24 Accounting for pension costs.
The regular pension costs are attributed to individual years using the projected unit method.
Variations in pension costs, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average remaining service lives of employees.
The difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the schemes is shown as a prepayment in the balance sheet.
The group has not adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits for accounting purposes but continues to make the transitional disclosures required by that standard in the notes to the accounts.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Profits and losses of subsidiary undertakings and branches which have currencies of operation other than sterling are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year end exchange rates or the contracted rate to the extent hedged.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiary undertakings and branches, that have currencies of operation other than sterling, net of any matching exchange difference on related foreign currency loans taken out to hedge overseas investments, are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are structured so as to reduce the market risk associated with the underlying transaction being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate exposures.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these financial instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest payable or receivable over the periods of the contracts.
Foreign exchange contracts which hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities are revalued at closing rates and exchange differences arising are taken to reserves.
Gains and losses on contracts hedging forecast transactional cash flows are recognised in the hedged periods.
Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments are classified in the cash flow statement in the same way as the transactions being hedged.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment in their value.
In previous years, costs in relation to taxation, treasury and public affairs administration were included in central costs.
In order to give a clearer view of divisional performance for 2003, UK home credit and international division have been recharged 4.9m and 2.4m respectively in respect of these costs.
In 2002 this recharge would have been 3.8m to UK home credit and 2.0m to international division.
The results shown above for 2002 have been restated to include these recharges.
Goodwill amortisation in 2003 includes 4.1m in respect of Yes Car Credit 2002 0.1m and 0.2m in respect of UK home credit 2002 0.2m.
Turnover between segments is not material.
Goodwill amortisation relates to UK and Republic of Ireland.
There is no material difference between the geographical analysis of turnover by location and destination.

P. A.
Holdings Limited and fide Facto 946 Limited, subsequently renamed as Yes Car Credit Limited and Provident Yes Car Credit Limited, the holding companies of the group of companies which operate Yes Car Credit, was acquired on 18 December 2002.
A preliminary assessment was made of the provisions and adjustments required to derive the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the group accounts for the year ended 31 December 2002.
These provisional adjustments were disclosed in the accounts of the group for the year ended 31 December 2002 but were still subject to uncertainty.
During the hindsight period allowed by FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting the directors were able to conclude upon their estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as shown in the table above.
As a result, the fair value of the car finance receivables has been reduced by 6.0m following a review of the adequacy of the bad debt provision at acquisition.
A further adjustment has been made to the purchase consideration, reflecting the estimated final acquisition cost following payment of all transaction costs.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the group may make contingent consideration payments, payable primarily on 30 June 2004 or, if the vendors so elect, on 30 June 2005 partly in cash and partly in loan notes to i the senior managers of Yes Car Credit and ii the institutional vendors.
The contingent consideration payments will be based upon the average of the adjusted audited profits after tax of the Yes Car Credit business for the year ending 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 Average Adjusted Profit after Tax AAPAT as defined in the acquisition agreement as follows: i The contingent consideration payment to the senior management of Yes Car Credit will be calculated as 2.58 times the AAPAT, with a cap of 50m which would only be payable if the AAPAT were to equal or exceed 19.38m.
ii The contingent consideration payment to the institutional vendors will be calculated as 6.0 times the surplus of the AAPAT over 3.23m, with a cap of 38m which would only be payable if the AAPAT were to equal or exceed 9.57m.
Initial estimates of contingent consideration, as disclosed in notes 18 and 20, will be revised as further and more certain information becomes available, with corresponding adjustments to goodwill.

e Loan notes issued to vendors at acquisition As part of the consideration for the acquisition of Yes Car Credit, the group issued loan notes of 6.7m to certain vendors.
These notes are primarily due on 30 June 2004 and carry interest rates linked to LIBOR.
f Cross currency swap arrangements Any borrowing, the liability of which is swapped into another currency, is accounted for as a liability in the swap currency and not in the original currency of denomination.

Market values have been used to determine the fair values of the groups derivative financial instruments.
d Hedging instruments The following table shows the extent to which the group has unrecognised and deferred gains and losses, in respect of financial instruments used as hedges, at the beginning and end of the year.
All gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
The US$ loan notes, which are fully hedged by a currency swap arrangement, are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contract.
Consequently, the carrying value of the loan effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, which is treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below: Unrecognised Deferred Total net Total net Gains Losses gains losses Gains Losses gains losses Gains and losses on hedging instruments m m m m m m At 1 January 2003 14.4 13.2 1.2 6.8 6.8 Arising in previous years that were recognised in 2003 7.2 11.0 3.8 Arising in previous years not recognised in 2003 7.2 2.2 5.0 6.8 6.8 Arising in 2003 3.9 3.6 0.3 15.0 15.0 Gains and losses on hedging instruments at 31 December 2003 11.1 5.8 5.3 21.8 21.8 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 8.0 6.2 1.8 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 or later 3.1 0.4 3.5 21.8 21.8 83 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 15 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued e Currency exposures As explained in the groups accounting policy, exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiary undertakings and branches, which have currencies of operation other than sterling, net of any matching exchange differences on related foreign currency loans taken out to hedge overseas investments, are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency.
Foreign exchange differences on the retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group subsidiary concerned and the group.

The two major schemes, which cover 99% of scheme members, are of the funded, defined benefit type.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate, trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the group was assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuations for the schemes were as at 1 January 2001 for the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme the senior pension scheme and 1 June 2001 for the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme the staff pension scheme.
The principal assumptions used were that the rate of return on investments would be 2.1% per annum higher than the rate of increase in salaries for the staff pension scheme and 1.1% higher for the senior pension scheme, and 4.1% and 3.6% per annum higher than the rate of increase in present and future pensions for the staff pension scheme and the senior pension scheme respectively.
At the valuation dates the market value of the assets of the schemes was 181.1m.
The market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 87% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
For the purposes of establishing the pension costs in the groups profit and loss account, the deficit is being amortised over the average remaining service lives of the employees who are currently members of the respective schemes.
Included in the groups balance sheet is a prepayment of 26.7m 2002 11.4m, which represents the excess of the contributions paid to the schemes over the charge in the profit and loss account.
89 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 29 Pension schemes continued a Pension schemes continued The two defined benefit schemes were closed to new members from 1 January 2003.
For new employees joining the group after 1 January 2003, a stakeholder pension plan was introduced into which the company contributes 8% of pensionable earnings provided that the members contribute a minimum of 6% of pensionable earnings.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost charge in the profit and loss account represents contributions payable by the group to the fund and amounted to 0.1m for the year ended 31 December 2003 2002 nil.
No contributions were payable to the fund at the year end.
b FRS 17 disclosures As noted above, the group operates two major defined benefit schemes in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out by a qualified independent actuary at 1 January 2001 on the senior pension scheme and as at 1 June 2001 on the staff pension scheme.
The valuation used in the FRS 17 disclosures has been based on these valuations which have been updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 31 December 2003.
