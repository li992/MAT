Exceptional items Exceptional operating expense In 2003, following the acquisition of GNI Holdings Limited, costs amounting to 15.0 million 11.5 million net of tax were incurred, or provided for, relating to the integration of the acquired business into the Groups existing business.
These costs relate principally to redundancy and staff retention costs of 11.5 million, and other termination and relocation costs of 3.5 million.
Of these costs, 8.7 million had been paid by 31 March 2003, with the remaining 6.3 million included as provisions or accruals in the year-end balance sheet.
Non-operating exceptional items Non-operating exceptional items in 2003 were nil.
In 2002, the loss on sale of Agricultural Products businesses of 12.1 million 12.1 million net of tax represented an adjustment to the loss on sale reported in March 2000.
The adjustments were the net effect of claims made under limited warranties given to the management buyout group.
These limited warranties were disclosed in the contingent liabilities note in the prior year, however during 2002 an agreement was reached whereby they were terminated so that the Man Group will not be required to make any further payments.
As part of this agreement the management buyout group also settled part of the loan note given to them by the Man Group such that the outstanding amount of the loan note was reduced from $100 million to $55 million as at 31 March 2002.

The Groups pension cost for the year amounted to 6.6 million 2002: 4.6 million and where appropriate is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
The latest actuarial valuation of the largest scheme, the Man Group plc Pension Fund formerly known as the E D & F Man Limited Group Pension Fund, a defined benefit pension plan, was made at 31 December 2002 using the market-related approach.
The most significant actuarial assumptions were price inflation 2.5% per annum, wage and salary increases 5.0% per annum and investment return 6.4% per annum.
Actuarial valuations are conducted every three years.
The preliminary results of the last actuarial valuation of the Man Group plc Pension Fund give the market value of the assets of the scheme as 93.4 million.
The actuarial value of the assets of the scheme represented approximately 87% of the liabilities for the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The funding level on a Minimum Funding Requirement basis was 108%.
The Group has net pension prepayments amounting to 7.9 million 2002: 4.1 million, which are included in debtors, this being the excess of the actual contributions paid over the accumulated pension cost.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit schemes.

Accordingly, the amount of loans to funds will vary from one period to the next as a consequence of the net effect of the level of sales in the period less the quantum of the external re-financing initiative in the period.
This external re-financing is typically in the form of total return swaps.
On these swaps the Group often enters into a committed purchase agreement and, in some instances, gives a first risk of loss guarantee to the external provider.
The probability of the Group incurring a loss as a result of giving these guarantees is remote as discussed in the other potential Group exposures section of the Finance Directors Review.
