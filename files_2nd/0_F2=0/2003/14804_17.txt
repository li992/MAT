40 Notes to the accounts 2003 Note 1 Statement of accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
All principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
b Presentation of profit and loss account Where applicable, profit and loss account information has been presented in a columnar format, which separately highlights goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
This is intended to enable the users of the accounts to determine more readily the impact of goodwill and exceptional items on the results of the Group.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates made up to 30 April in each year except as noted below: Associates The Groups share of the profit of Road King Infrastructure Limited is based on the results of that company for the year to 31 December.
The Groups share of the profit loss of other associates is based on the results for the period covered by the Groups financial year.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the results of businesses purchased from the effective date of acquisition and excludes the results of discontinued operations and businesses sold from the effective date of disposal.
No profit and loss account is presented for the parent company, Stagecoach Group plc, as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. d Intangible assets In accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions after 30 April 1998 is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet at cost less amortisation.
Each acquisition is reviewed and where the goodwill has a finite economic life, goodwill is amortised over that life.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill, account has been taken of the nature of the business acquired, stability of the industry sector, extent of barriers to entry and expected future impact of competition.
The useful life of goodwill arising on the acquisitions made is estimated by the directors to be between 5 and 20 years.
Provision is made for any impairment, with impairment reviews being undertaken in accordance with FRS 11, Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 30 April 1998 and earlier periods was written off directly to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by the current accounting standard, the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.
On the disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, goodwill previously written off directly to reserves in respect of such an undertaking is transferred to the profit and loss account and constitutes part of the gain or loss to the Group arising on disposal.
Fair value accounting adjustments have been made to take account of the revaluation of certain fixed assets on an existing use basis, discounting of long term liabilities but not deferred tax provisions and other changes in accounting policies required to comply with Group policies.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended in the following years accounts where necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post-acquisition.
41 Notes to the accounts 2003 Note 1 Statement of accounting policies continued e Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at their original historic cost or fair value on acquisition net of depreciation and any provision for impairment as set out in note 12.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Heritable and freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties Over period of lease Public service vehicles PSVs and transportation equipment 7 to 16 years, depending on type IT and other equipment, furniture and fittings 5 to 10 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years Heritable and freehold land is not depreciated.
The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value or value in use.
f Pre-contract costs In accordance with UITF Abstract 34, Pre-contract costs, the costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred, except where it is virtually certain that a contract will be awarded in which case they are recognised as an asset and are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the franchise.
g Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
In the Companys accounts investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provision for impairment.
h Associates and Joint Ventures In the Group accounts the investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of associates and joint ventures profits less losses, while the Groups share of associates and joint ventures net assets is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where the Group has an interest in a joint ventures net liabilities, the Groups share of net liabilities is classified within provisions for liabilities and charges.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised goodwill is included in the carrying value of the Groups investments.
i Stocks Stocks of parts and consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Taxicabs which are held for sale or lease to independent contractors are included within stocks.
j Hire purchase and lease obligations Assets acquired under hire purchase and finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as assets at the equivalent of the purchase price and as obligations to pay hire purchase capital instalments or future lease rentals.
Obligations arising from hire purchase contracts and finance leases represent the total of the capital payments outstanding at the date of the balance sheet.
Future finance charges are not included.
Future finance charges are calculated in relation to the reducing balance of capital outstanding throughout the contract and charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis.
Assets capitalised under lease finance and other similar contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful economic lives.
Assets capitalised under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The principal restriction on property held under finance or hire purchase agreements is a restriction on the right to dispose of the property during the period of the agreement.
42 Notes to the accounts 2003 Note 1 Statement of accounting policies continued k Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement either the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses as the related pre-tax item.
In accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Taxation, full provision is made for deferred tax on a non-discounted basis in respect of all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding sale agreement and undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries and associates.
Deferred tax is calculated at rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent they are more likely than not to be recovered.
l Turnover Turnover represents gross revenue earned from public transport services and operating lease rentals receivable, and excludes future payments received on account.
Amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included as part of turnover.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and VAT.
Revenues incidental to the Groups principal activity including advertising income and maintenance income are reported as miscellaneous revenue.
Bus and rail revenue is recognised at the time of travel.
Bus revenue from local authority and similar contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
Income from advertising and other activities is recognised as the income is earned.
Compensation receivable by UK Rail companies in respect of service disruption under the performance regime provisions of the track access agreements with Network Rail is recognised over the expected period of disruption and is shown as other operating income.
m Tokens Tokens issued by National Transport Tokens Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, are credited to a token redemption provision.
Redemptions are offset against this and associated handling commission paid to third parties is included in operating costs.
Funds from the sale of tokens required for token redemption are included as a financing activity in the consolidated cash flow statement.
The estimation of the balance sheet provision for token redemption is based on the value of tokens issued by the Group but not yet redeemed at the balance sheet date.
Allowance is made for the estimated proportion of tokens in issue that will never be redeemed.
This allowance is estimated with reference to historic redemption rates.
At 30 April 2003, it has been estimated that 97% 2002 97% of tokens in issue will be redeemed.
n Pension costs The Group provides for and funds pension liabilities on the advice of external actuaries and makes payments to segregated funds managed by specialist financial institutions.
Independent actuarial valuations on a going concern basis are carried out at least every three years.
The employer costs of providing retirement benefits to employees are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis so as to produce a substantially level percentage of the current and future pensionable payroll.
Variations from regular cost arising from any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of the pension funds assets over the actuarial valuation of the pension funds liabilities are allocated to the profit and loss account over the employees average remaining service lives.
Any timing difference between amounts charged in the profit and loss account and paid to the pension funds is shown in the balance sheet as an asset or a liability.
Details of the principal Group pension schemes are given in note 26d.
The transitional disclosures required under FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, are also included in note 26d.
43 Notes to the accounts 2003 Note 1 Statement of accounting policies continued o Foreign currencies The accounts of overseas subsidiaries and associate undertakings are maintained in the local currencies in which the subsidiaries transact business.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary and associate undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations, together with exchange differences arising on foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency derivatives, to the extent they hedge the Groups investment in overseas operations, are dealt with in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end except in those instances where forward contracts are in place, in which case the contract rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Principal rates of exchange 2003 2002 New Zealand Dollar Year end rate 2.86 3.40 Average rate 3.10 3.26 Hong Kong Dollar Year end rate 12.46 11.37 Average rate 12.15 11.17 US Dollar Year end rate 1.60 1.46 Average rate 1.56 1.43 p Accounting for finance costs and debt Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance costs that are recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of each accounting period.
The carrying amount is reduced by amounts paid in respect of finance costs and or repayments of principal.
q Government grants Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is expensed.
Revenue grants receivable in respect of the operation of rail franchises in the UK are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which the related expenditure is recognised in the profit and loss account or where they do not relate to any specific expenditure, in the year in which the grant is receivable.
These rail franchise grants are classified within Other Operating Income.
44 Notes to the accounts 2003 Note 1 Statement of accounting policies continued r Derivatives and financial investments Financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates and to hedge overseas net investments.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are either held off balance sheet or deferred on balance sheet and recognised either in the profit and loss account or as adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups financial statements.
Gains and losses arising on derivatives hedging overseas net investments are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
For interest rate and commodity swaps to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate or fuel cost by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Cash flows under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable and fuel costs over the periods of the contracts.
Gains and losses arising from the termination of these contracts are deferred on balance sheet and amortised to the profit and loss account over the remaining period of the related hedged item or recognised immediately in the profit and loss account where the hedged item no longer exists.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position no longer exists or the hedge is no longer effective, provision is made for any fair value loss on the instrument at that time.
s Marketing costs Marketing costs incurred during the start up phase of a new activity are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
t Insurance The Group receives claims in respect of traffic incidents and employee claims.
The Group protects against the cost of such claims through third party insurance policies.
An element of the claims are not insured as a result of the excess on insurance policies.
Provision is made on a discounted basis for the estimated cost to the Group net of insurance recoveries to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
The estimation of the balance sheet insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the Group.

The increase mainly reflects the deed of amendment agreed with the UKs Strategic Rail Authority in respect of South West Trains and is offset by increased operating costs.

As at 30 April 2002, the Group undertook an impairment review of Coach USA.
The Directors concluded that at that time, no impairment write-down was required but announced that a review of Coach USAs business would be undertaken.
The recovery in revenues for the six months ended 31 October 2002 was less than expected and trading conditions in North America continued to be difficult.
As a result of the change in strategy for Coach USA and the absence of a significant recovery in revenues, the Group undertook a further review of the carrying value of Coach USAs assets as at 31 October 2002.
The commercial assumptions used in reviewing the carrying value of Coach USA at that time are consistent with the current strategic plans for that business.
The carrying values of current assets within Coach USA were also reviewed to ensure those were properly valued.
Appropriate write-downs were recorded in the six months ended 31 October 2002.
These write-downs included adjustments to the carrying value of taxicab inventory and receivables, where the realisable value had fallen reflecting market conditions at that time.
The remaining goodwill and tangible fixed assets of Coach USA were reviewed for impairment.
In accordance with FRS 11, Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, Coach USA was divided into appropriate Income Generating Units or IGUs.
The carrying value of each IGU as at 31 October 2002 was compared to its estimated recoverable amount, being the higher of its value in use and net realisable value to the Group.
The value in use of each IGU was derived from discounted cash flow projections that covered the period to 30 April 2007.
After 30 April 2007, the projections used a long-term growth rate compatible with projections for the US economy.
The average discount rate used to arrive at the value in use was 13.0% on a pre-tax basis.
The remaining tangible fixed assets and goodwill of each IGU are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, which in the case of goodwill is 16.25 years from 30 April 2003.
49 Notes to the accounts 2003 Note 5 Loss profit on ordinary activities before taxation continued The Group closed a number of businesses in the USA as a consequence of the review.
Specific provision has been made for losses associated with the closure of these businesses over and above the write-down of asset values described above.
These additional losses include employee redundancy payments, operating lease termination payments and professional fees directly attributable to the closures.
To the extent the written-down values as at 31 October 2002 were based on projected cash flows, the actual cash flows for the six months ended 30 April 2003 have been compared to the projections.
Actual cash flows were not significantly different to those projected.
Year ended The aggregate exceptional charges across all of the IGUs were as follows: 30 April 2003 m Provision for losses on operations to be terminated 7.7 Write-down of current assets to net realisable value 17.8 Impairment of tangible fixed assets 162.7 Impairment of goodwill 386.8 575.0 As at The residual written down values of Coach USAs net assets as at 30 April 2003 were as follows: 30 April 2003 m Goodwill 108.0 Tangible fixed assets 231.0 Net current liabilities 8.5 Net assets before debt and tax balances 330.5 Net assets for Coach USA included in note 2 d totalled 323.2m.

The cash cost to the Company is unaffected but the cash is used by the Companys registrars to acquire shares to be provided to shareholders as an alternative to the cash dividend.
The alternative comprised ordinary shares with a market value of 36.13 pence per existing ordinary share.
A similar arrangement applied to last years final dividend of 1.3 pence per share, the relevant market value being 22.00 pence per existing ordinary share.
Note 9 Loss earnings per share Loss earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with FRS 14 Earnings per Share by calculating Group loss profit on ordinary activities after tax, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year based on the following: 2003 2002 Loss Weighted Loss Loss Weighted Loss earnings average no.

This has been presented to allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying performance.
In accordance with FRS 14, share options are only treated as dilutive in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if their exercise would result in the issue of ordinary shares at less than fair value.
Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive where the effect is to reduce earnings per share or increase loss per share.
Accordingly, the basic loss per share for 2003 has not been adjusted for the dilutive shares as the effect would be to reduce the loss per share.

In February 2002, the Group converted 100,000 of its 518,380 7.5% HK$1,000 convertible preference shares in Road King Infrastructure Limited to ordinary shares.
The remaining 418,380 preference shares were converted on 12 June 2003 which resulted in us having a 31.2% interest in Road Kings ordinary shares.
The equivalent market value of the Groups ordinary share investment in Road King post-conversion of the preference shares would be HK$661.1m 53.0m.
This calculation uses the market value of Road Kings shares at 30 April 2003 and the exchange rate prevailing at that date.
The coupon received on the preference shares has been included in the share of associates operating profits.
The Groups share of operating profit is based on the most recent publicly available information, being the results for the year ended 31 December 2002.
The carrying value of the Groups interest in Road King Infrastructure Limited as at 30 April 2003 was 62.0m.
The principal joint ventures are: Country of Number of Nominal value of % held at incorporation shares in issue share capital 30 April 2003 operation at 30 April 2003 in issue at 30 April 2003 Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited United Kingdom 34.8m 3.5m 49 Trainline Holdings Limited United Kingdom 3.4m 3.4m 49 Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited is the holding company of Virgin Rail Group Limited, which in turn is the holding company of CrossCountry Trains Limited and West Coast Trains Limited.
Trainline Holdings Limited is the holding company of thetrainline.
The Virgin Rail Group Holdings and Trainline Holdings shareholders agreements provide for joint decision making on key matters and equal representation on the Boards of both companies.
As a consequence the investments have been accounted for as joint ventures.
As part of the original acquisition, the Group acquired a 20m shareholder loan to Virgin Rail Group Limited, now a subsidiary of Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited.
The shareholder loan carries a 10% coupon and 10m was repaid on 28 April 2000.
Virgin Rail Group Limited is restricted from paying dividends until any shareholders loans payable by it have been repaid.
Under an agreement with the UKs Strategic Rail Authority SRA, Virgin Rail Group Limited, CrossCountry Trains Limited and West Coast Trains Limited may not pay dividends prior to 1 March 2004.
As at 30 April 2002, the Group undertook an impairment review of its investment in Virgin Rail Group in accordance with FRS 11.
The directors concluded, at that time, no impairment write-down was required.
However, for each of the five years following the initial impairment review, the Group is required to review its initial projections in light of the actual cash flows.
The Group has therefore reviewed the projections made in connection with the 30 April 2002 impairment review.
This indicated that the actual net cash flows earned by the Group from its investment in Virgin Rail Group during the year ended 30 April 2003 were in line with those projected.
Virgin Rail Groups two train franchises are presently operating with subsidy from the SRA on the basis of a one-year budget set by the SRA.
The value of the Groups investment in Virgin Rail Group depends on the agreement of long-term commercial arrangements with the SRA for the operation of Virgin Rail Groups two franchises.
Virgin Rail Group has not yet agreed terms for the long-term operation of the franchises and it is not known with certainty when these arrangements will be agreed.
In addition, Virgin Rail Group continues to be significantly impacted by the performance of Network Rail.
Network Rail is contractually responsible for upgrading certain railway infrastructure, on which the future revenue growth of Virgin Rail Groups train operations is dependent.
The directors believe that these uncertainties give rise to a need to undertake a fresh impairment review as at 30 April 2003.
In accordance with FRS 11, we have compared the carrying value of our net investment in Virgin Rail Group, with its estimated recoverable amount, being the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
The Group has conducted this fresh review with reference to the terms agreed between Virgin Rail Group and the SRA on 19 July 2002 for the future operation of the two franchises.
There remains uncertainty over the timing of agreeing new long-term commercial arrangements for each franchise and also around the level of shareholder return that will be achievable under such arrangements.
The SRA has the right to offer the CrossCountry franchise for competitive tender and this presents a further uncertainty.
However, to date, the SRA has not indicated that it intends to exercise this right.
In conducting the impairment review as at 30 April 2003, the directors have made best estimates of future cash flows to the expected end of the two franchises in 2012 after taking account of these factors.
Any estimation of value in use is subjective because it is based on estimates of future cash flows.
Actual results can differ from those assumed and there can be no absolute assurance that the assumptions used will hold true.
56 Notes to the accounts 2003 Note 13 Fixed asset investments continued This review indicates that there is no impairment loss.
The value in use of Virgin Rail Group was determined using an average pre-tax discount rate of 11.4%.
However, the directors will keep this matter under review in the light of changing circumstances.
The remaining goodwill relating to the original acquisition of Virgin Rail Group is being amortised over its remaining useful life of 8.8 years from 30 April 2003.

Acquisitions During the year a further three acquisitions have been concluded by Coach USA for a total consideration of 2.8m in cash.
The fair value of the net assets acquired was 1.3m giving rise to goodwill of 1.5m which has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years.

c Currency exposures As explained in the Finance Directors review on pages 19 to 21, the Groups objective in managing currency borrowings and net exposures arising from its investments in net assets of overseas subsidiaries is to maintain a low cost of borrowing and to retain some potential for currency related appreciation whilst partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All foreign currency borrowings are taken out to provide for or to hedge against foreign net investments.
Gains and losses arising from these currency borrowings and net exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The Group generally hedges actual and forecast foreign exchange transactional exposures up to one year forward.
At 30 April 2003 and 30 April 2002 there were no material net transactional exposures.

In October 1999 the Company established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST for the purpose of satisfying share option schemes for staff.
During the year to 30 April 2000 a contribution of 10.5m and a loan of 10.0m were made to the QUEST and used by the QUEST to apply for 11,500,000 new ordinary shares of 0.5p each at the market price of 1.78 per share on 29 October 1999.
Under the provisions of FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions, the assets and liabilities of the QUEST are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Group and the QUEST is consolidated in the Group accounts.
Balances and transactions between the QUEST and other Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Since the shares have not been issued outside of the Group, the only effect of the above transaction was to increase share capital by 0.1m.
The 11,500,000 shares are to be used to satisfy the valid exercise of options granted under the Stagecoach savings related share option schemes.
Between 29 October 1999 and 30 April 2002 1,769,336 shares were transferred to option holders.
During the year to 30 April 2003, a further 4,829,012 shares were transferred to option holders.
The remaining 4,901,652 shares are held by the QUEST.

The right to exercise the option is at the employees discretion within six months following the end of the fixed period.
As explained in the Remuneration report on pages 30 to 34, certain former directors of the Company hold share options where the expiry date is earlier than the original expiry date due to the directors no longer being employed by the Group.
All options were granted for nil consideration.
The mid-market price for these shares at 30 April 2003 was 0.44.
The Companys shares traded in the range 0.125 to 0.805 during the year to that date.

d Pension commitments i Summary of schemes operated The Group contributes to a number of pension schemes.
The principal defined benefit occupational benefit schemes are as follows: The South West Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : The Island Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme SGPS : A number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS.
These defined benefit schemes cover the majority of the Groups UK employees.
These schemes are devised in accordance with local employment terms and conditions.
Each scheme is administered independently of the employers and the scheme assets are held in trusts that are managed by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of defined contribution schemes covering non-UK employees.
ii Accounting for pensions under SSAP 24 The Group has applied SSAP24, Accounting for pension costs in preparing its accounts.
The total pension cost reported in the profit and loss account and the cash outflow to the Group in the year ended 30 April 2003 can be analysed as follows: Pension cost Cash outflow 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m UK Bus Group overheads SGPS 14.0 12.4 15.5 15.0 LGPS 2.7 1.9 3.0 2.4 Other 0.8 0.2 0.9 Nil Rail RPS 12.1 1.8 5.9 0.4 Coach USA 1.6 1.7 1.6 1.7 31.2 18.0 26.9 19.5 The balance sheet position of each scheme as at 30 April 2003 is analysed below.
It should be noted that the balance sheet position under SSAP 24 that is shown on page 71 is not equivalent to an actuarial estimate of the schemes funding position at the balance sheet date.
The net balance sheet asset of 23.4m 2002 27.7m shown below is the sum of the cumulative differences between contributions paid by the employers into the schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account.

The key details for each scheme are as follows: Most recent Latest actuarial Funding Market full actuarial review for Level value of valuation of SSAP 24 accounting % assets scheme purposes m UK Bus Group overheads SGPS 5 April 2002 30 April 2002 105 325.9 LGPS 31 March 2001 30 April 2001 121 186.6 Rail RPS 31 December 2001 31 December 2001 105 225.5 The above defined benefit schemes are funded at contribution rates determined by independent actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of valuations are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increases in earnings and pensions.
The valuations referred to above for SSAP 24 accounting purposes assume that investment returns, net of management expenses, will exceed earnings growth by an average of at least 3.5% per annum.
Present and future pensions are assumed to increase at an average of 2.6% per annum for SGPS and 2.5% per annum for the other defined benefit schemes.
iii Accounting for pensions under FRS 17 Under the transitional arrangements for the implementation of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, the Group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 as set out above.
The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 are provided below.
The calculations of FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, which have been updated to 30 April 2003 by an independent professionally qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
2003 2002 The main financial assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 4.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment SGPS 2.3 2.3 Other defined benefit schemes 2.5 2.5 Discount rate 5.5 6.1 Inflation 2.5 2.5 In applying FRS 17, the directors believe that the RPS schemes need to be considered separately.
The directors understand that the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of the RPS schemes following the expiry of the South West Trains and Island Line franchises.
Furthermore, the franchise payments in respect of the new South West Trains franchise to February 2007 take account of the cash cost of pension scheme funding during the franchise term.
The amounts relating to the RPS schemes are separately highlighted on page 72.
