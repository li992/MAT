Exceptionally for this year only, the components of the Specialty Engineering Division have been separately identified to facilitate comparison with the divisional structure previously adopted.
The segmental analysis has also been redefined to show North America as a separate segment due to acquisition and restructuring activities resulting in the company having more closely-linked operations in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The analyses of 2002 profits and assets employed have been restated following the adoption of FRS17 Retirement Benefits.
Operating profit from continuing activities after exceptional items amounted to 339.5m 2002 281.6m after charging goodwill amortisation of 32.4m 2002 38.8m and exceptional items of nil 2002 43.7m.
The contribution from discontinued businesses predominantly Polymer Sealing Solutions comprised turnover of 426.9m 2002 635.1m and operating profit of 40.2m 2002 52.1m after charging goodwill amortisation of 11.7m 2002 11.9m.

The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and in the United States and are of the defined benefit type, with assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The group accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, principally post-retirement healthcare, in accordance with FRS17 Retirement Benefits.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2003 and 5 April 2003.
The most recent valuations of the principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 August 2002.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31 July 2003.
Contributions to these schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members working lives.
The pension costs of other schemes operated by the group were assessed in accordance with local practice.
The group provides a defined contributions 401K plan for its US employees.
The disclosures relate to all defined benefit retirement plans in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Defined benefit plans in other territories, most of which are unfunded, have net pension liabilities of 27.4m 2002 18.3m.
No additional disclosure is given in respect of these plans on grounds of their immateriality.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below.
All US plans were in deficit at 31 July 2002 and 31 July 2003.

For 2004 the company has presently agreed to contribute the current service cost plus 12m to its UK plans.
In the United States no contributions for 2004 have presently been determined.
The actual contributions will depend upon investment conditions and are likely to be in the range 20-30m.

This is lent through to the relevant subsidiary on inter-company loans at commercial arms length terms.
Smiths strong cash generation in the businesses is tax-efficiently remitted to the United Kingdom to repay central borrowings.
Local working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements are typically funded by local bank facilities, which are not guaranteed by the parent company.
The company seeks to manage its borrowings and business risks to maintain its current credit ratings.
Borrowings for periods more than 364 days require Board approval.
The company seeks to maintain a spread of maturity profiles on its debt and no more than 30% of the companys net debt will be held on borrowings due within one year, without firm plans for refinancing or repayment.
The analysis of net debt, after taking into account interest rate swaps, is as follows: Fixed borrowings Weighted average Floating Total Amount borrowings 2003 As at 31 July 2003 Interest rate Years fixed m m m Currencies Sterling 7.15% 12 157.8 170.2 328.0 US Dollar 5.98% 8 75.0 129.3 204.3 Euro 4.03% 2 164.7 85.4 250.1 Japanese Yen 2.30% 1 7.7 0.3 8.0 Other 0.1 6.6 6.7 405.3 391.8 797.1 Cash and deposits 82.0 Net debt 715.1 Maturity On demand under one year 27.8 90.5 118.3 One to two years 154.1 58.7 212.8 Two to five years 1.6 1.6 Over five years 221.8 242.6 464.4 405.3 391.8 797.1 SMITHS GROUP PLC DIRECTORS REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2003 29 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 21 BORROWINGS AND NET DEBT CONTINUED Fixed borrowings Weighted average Floating Total Amount borrowings 2002 As at 31 July 2002 Interest rate Years fixed m m m Currencies Sterling 7.19% 13 161.9 167.0 328.9 US Dollar 8.27% 1 43.6 196.8 240.4 Euro 4.45% 2 136.8 77.0 213.8 Japanese Yen 2.30% 1 8.0 32.4 40.4 Other 10.07% 1 0.7 10.5 11.2 351.0 483.7 834.7 Cash and deposits 109.5 Net debt 725.2 Maturity On demand under one year 46.7 117.0 163.7 One to two years 17.3 165.7 183.0 Two to five years 139.0 52.5 191.5 Over five years 148.0 148.5 296.5 351.0 483.7 834.7 Borrowing facilities The current net debt level of 715.1m represents 2.6 times free cash-flow, and EBITDA interest cover is more than 13 times comfortably within the current credit rating parameter.
The borrowings of all non-UK operations are in local currencies to provide a structural hedge against foreign currency movements on the overseas assets.
The medium-term borrowings principally comprise an unsecured nominal 1300m 6.375% bond maturing in 2005 which is largely swapped to floating interest rates.
The long-term borrowings greater than five years of 464m 2002 297m relate to Smiths Group plc unsecured nominal 150m 7.875% bonds maturing in 2010 which are swapped to floating interest rates and to unsecured nominal 150m 7.25% bonds maturing in 2016 which remain fixed rate.
In January 2003 the group raised US$250m in the US private placement market.
The coupon on the 10 year Senior Notes was set at 5.45%, two-thirds of which was swapped to floating rate for the life of the instrument.
Notes are guaranteed by Smiths Group plc.
To ensure better than adequate liquidity committed unused credit facilities of at least 100m are maintained at all times.
At the year-end the company had the following unused committed borrowing facilities: 2003 2002 m m Expiring within one year 540.0 65.0 Expiring between one and two years 337.0 540.0 402.0 The company also has a number of uncommitted facilities and overdraft lines provided by its core relationship banking group.

22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS a Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The company uses financial instruments to raise finance for its operations and manage the related financial risks.
Acceptable derivative instruments for hedging are forward currency contracts, currency and interest rate swaps and options, spot and forward rate agreements, collars, caps, floors, cylinders and similar bank products.
Counterparties for hedging are limited to our relationship banks with credit ratings of A or better to avoid unnecessary credit risk.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
The companys policy forbids trading or speculation in financial instruments.
Where the underlying transaction being hedged disappears or is cancelled or does not arise, the related financial instrument must also be cancelled or otherwise negated as soon as possible.
Set out below is a year-end comparison of the book value and current fair value of the companys financial instruments by category.
Fair values of interest rate swaps, currency swap and forward currency contracts are based on the market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
Where market prices are not available, the fair value has been calculated by discounting cash-flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

The transactions to which the forward currency contracts relate are mainly expected to occur in 2004 and 2005.
Currency rate swaps protect the group from transaction exposure in line with its policy as set out in note 22 e and interest rate swaps are used to ensure that the groups debt is broadly evenly split between fixed and floating rate funds.

The unrecognised gains on hedges at 31 July 2003 largely relate to interest rate swap contracts that swap fixed rate debt obligations to floating rates.
However, all the gains and losses on the hedging of foreign currency transactions are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
There are no material gains or losses on hedging instruments within the consolidated balance sheet.

The bank balances and cash comprise 28.4m in respect of short-term balances earning interest, 21.8m in respect of balances which are non-interest earning and 6.9m held as compensating credits against Yen term loans.
Short-term deposits are invested for periods with maturity under one year.
e Currency exposures Transactions All material cross-border trading contracts or forecast commitments are hedged at inception by appropriate derivative financial instruments, with the companys core banks as counterparties.
The company takes competitive quotes on all major foreign exchange contracts through its central foreign exchange programme.
For smaller deals, the company has centralised the entire groups foreign exchange dealings through an e-based foreign exchange trading system operated by a major bank.
The analysis below shows the net monetary assets and liabilities of the group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency and therefore give rise to exchange gains and losses in the profit and loss account.
The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of hedging instruments used to manage these exposures.

The company does not hedge the translation of its overseas profits, although does mitigate currency effects through foreign interest costs and by applying average exchange rates for the year.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
