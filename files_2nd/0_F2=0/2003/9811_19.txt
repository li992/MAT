Other operating income comprises mainly rents from unlicensed properties.
d Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct materials and a proportion of appropriate overheads.
e Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the period-end balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and profits as stated in the accounts.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and assets are only recognised where probable.
f Tangible fixed assets i Freehold and leasehold properties are stated at valuation or at cost.
Plant, furnishings, equipment and other similar items are stated at cost.
ii Freehold buildings are depreciated to residual value on a straight line basis over 50 years.
iii Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated to residual value on a straight line basis at rates calculated to provide for the cost of the assets over their anticipated useful lives.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over the lower of the lease period and 50 years and other tangible assets over periods ranging from three to 15 years.
iv Own labour directly attributable to capital projects is capitalised.
Valuation of properties Trading properties are revalued professionally by independent valuers on a five-year rolling basis.
When a valuation or expected proceeds are below current carrying value the asset concerned is reviewed for impairment.
Impairment losses are charged either to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, or to the profit and loss account.
g Fixed asset disposals Profit on fixed asset disposals is net sale proceeds less carrying value of the assets.
h Pensions Pension costs for the Groups final salary pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the average working life of employees, in accordance with the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period incurred.
42 W&DB Annual Report 2003 1 Accounting policies continued i Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost.
j Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP The assets of the trust are recognised as fixed asset investments until the shares have been vested unconditionally to specific employees.
Any permanent diminution in the value of the shares is recognised immediately as a charge to the profit and loss account.
k Trade loans Trade loans provided to publicans who purchase from the Group are recorded as fixed asset investments.
They are linked to supply terms and are of a long-term nature.
Trade loans are held at the lower of the amount advanced and the recoverable amount.
l Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
The Directors consider the carrying value of goodwill and make appropriate adjustments to reflect the disposal of certain assets to which it relates.
Where goodwill is impaired, the charge is taken to the profit and loss account.
m Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease.
The cost of assets held under finance leases is included within tangible fixed assets and depreciation is provided in accordance with the policy for the class of asset concerned.
The corresponding obligations under these leases are shown as creditors.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
n Financial instruments The financial costs of debt instruments are held at cost and are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.

The funds of the final salary scheme are administered by trustees and are separate from the Group.
The Group contribution rate increased from 16.5% to 18.5% of pensionable salaries in April 2003.
In September 2003, the Group contribution rate rose to 32.0% of pensionable salaries, following the recommendations of an independent qualified actuary.
The Final Salary Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants on 29 September 1997.
A Group Personal Pension Plan has been made available to eligible employees since that date.
The latest scheme valuation of the Final Salary Pension Scheme conducted by an independent actuary for the Group was as at 1 September 2003.
The actuarial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of investment return and the rates of increase in earnings.
The valuation as at 1 September 2003 assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.9% per annum and price inflation by 4.9% per annum.
It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 2.1% per annum and price inflation by 3.1% per annum.
The market value of scheme assets was 135.3m, which was sufficient to cover 78.5% of members accrued benefits.
The Group increased its contribution rate with effect from September 2003, in response to this shortfall.
The Group paid total contributions of 3.6m 2002: 3.6m to the scheme during the period.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, it is expected that the costs of benefits will steadily rise in the future, as the average age of members increases.
A provision of 3.0m 2002: 3.1m is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss account over the Groups contributions paid.
Group Personal Pension Plan The Group paid contributions of 0.3m 2002: 0.2m to the Group Personal Pension Plan defined contribution scheme during the period.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits disclosure The Group operates a defined benefit scheme.
An actuarial valuation for the purposes of FRS 17 was carried out at 27 September 2003 and 28 September 2002 by a qualified independent actuary.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing properties to their market value or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided for, after offsetting available capital losses, is estimated at 40.7m.
At present, it is not envisaged that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Supplementary earnings per share figures are presented.
These exclude the effects of exceptionals and goodwill amortisation.
The Directors consider that the supplementary figures provide a useful additional indication of performance.

19 Financial instruments Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise debentures, preference shares, bank borrowings loans and overdrafts, other loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations, which have not been included in the following disclosures.
The only derivatives that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps and other interest rate hedging instruments.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, debentures and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups aim is to reduce the risk of exposure to market rate fluctuations in interest movements in the medium term.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to ensure continuity of funding and in particular to ensure that debt requirements for the medium term are available through committed facilities.
In addition, having regard to the longevity of the Groups assets, secured debentures are regarded as being suitable debt instruments.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities and other uncommitted facilities.
Currency risk The Group has no material exposure to currency rate risk.
