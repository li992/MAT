Notes to the Financial Statements 1Accounting policies The following paragraphs summarise the main accounting policies of the Group, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups Financial Statements.
aFinancial statements convention The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain properties, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
There is no material difference between historical cost profits and those reported in the profit and loss account.
"In respect of FRS17 ""Retirement Benefits"" the Group is following the transitional arrangements under which additional disclosure on retirement benefits is required in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2003 as set out in note 31. bBasis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2003."
All Financial Statements are prepared on a uniform basis throughout the Group.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted, unless otherwise stated.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
"cGoodwill Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when FRS10 ""Goodwill and intangible assets"" was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition."
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life, normally 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging crediting the unamortised amount of any related goodwill negative goodwill.
dInvestments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment where appropriate.
The Directors consider annually whether a provision against the value of investments on an individual basis is required.
Such provisions are charged in the profit and loss account in the year.
eForeign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract, and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
40 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2003 1Accounting policies continued fTurnover Turnover represents the invoiced value of sales to customers outside the Group, less returns, allowances and value added tax.
Turnover is recognised in the Financial Statements upon despatch of the goods.
"gDevelopment expenditure Development expenditure is accounted for in accordance with SSAP13 ""Accounting for Research and Development"" and is written off in the period in which it arises."
hPension costs Defined benefit scheme Contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account on a basis which spreads the cost over employees working lives with the Group.
The regular pension costs are attributed to individual years using the discounted income projected unit method.
Variations in pension costs, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average remaining service lives of employees.
Defined contribution scheme Contributions to the Groups defined contribution scheme are determined as a percentage of employees earnings and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
iStocks Stocks of raw materials, bought in components and goods for resale are valued at the lower of invoice cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods and manufactured components are valued at the lower of works cost and net realisable value.
Works cost consists of direct materials, labour and factory and administrative overheads applicable to the stage of production.
jTangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at either cost or professional valuation less depreciation.
"On adoption of FRS15 ""Tangible Fixed Assets"", the Group followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of land and buildings which were revalued in 1989 but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future."
Depreciation is provided on all fixed assets, other than freehold and long leasehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
The rates are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings - 2.5% to 5% per annum Quarries - 5% to 15% per annum Short leasehold property - over the period of the lease Fixed plant and equipment - 5% to 25% per annum Mobile plant and vehicles - 14% to 30% per annum Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use.
kCash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.
Marshalls plc Annual Report 2003 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1Accounting policies continued lLeased assets Elements of plant and machinery are subject to finance leases giving rights approximating to ownership.
Such assets are treated as though they had been purchased outright and are included in tangible fixed assets at a value equal to the total capital payments to be made during the term of the lease.
The total amount of the capital payments outstanding is included in creditors.
The amount included in tangible fixed assets is written off over the shorter of the useful economic life of the asset or the term of the lease.
The rental cost of all operating leases is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lives of the leases.
"mDeferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation resulting from timing differences, other than those specifically excluded by FRS19 ""Deferred Taxation"", between profits computed for taxation purposes and profits stated in the Financial Statements to the extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of those timing differences."
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

31 Pension scheme The Group operates the Marshalls Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which has both a defined benefit and a defined contribution section.
The assets of the Scheme are held in separately managed funds which are independent of the Groups finances.
SSAP24 A funded defined benefit scheme covering certain employees is operated by Trustees as a self-administered independent fund using external investment managers.
The Scheme is valued by an independent Actuary and an actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2003 using the discounted income projected unit method.
The main actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes were investment returns exceeding salary growth by 3.5% per annum and pension increases of 3.0% per annum for pre 6 April 1997 benefits and at 3.25% per annum for post 6 April 1997.
The valuation showed that the market value of the Schemes assets at 6 April 2003 was 95.6 million and the market value for the purposes of the Annual Report at 31 December 2003 was 114.0 million.
The actuarial value of the assets at 6 April 2003 was 117.1 million, whereas the actuarial valuation of the Scheme liabilities was 116.9 million.
The ratio of the value of the assets to the valuation of the liabilities is therefore 100% on an ongoing basis.
The contribution rate currently being paid including the insured death in service benefits, expenses, member contributions and Age Related Rebate is 12.7% of total pensionable salaries.
Marshalls plc Annual Report 2003 59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Pension scheme continued In recognition of the fact that the cost of pension provision is increasing, the Company intends to increase their contribution rate by 1% from April 2004, and by a further 1% from April 2005.
It is also planned that member contributions will increase by a similar amount in order for employees to maintain the current level of benefit accrual.
In addition, Limited Price Indexation will replace guaranteed increases in pensions for future service.
The defined benefit scheme charge for the year was 1,595,000 2002: 1,718,000.
Certain other employees are members of a company defined contribution scheme which invests funds in which the contributions for each individual member are separately identifiable and the benefits calculated accordingly.
The total of the defined contributions schemesand insured schemescosts charged for the year was 516,000 2002: 268,000.
"FRS17 Whilst the Company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 ""Accounting for Pension Costs"" under FRS17 ""Retirement benefits"" the transitional disclosures set out below are required."
The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme has been updated by an independent, qualified Actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the Scheme at 31 December 2003.
Main assumptions for FRS17 purposes: 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 Discount rate 5.50% 5.50% 6.00% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% 3.50% 4.00% Rate of increase in pensions payment 3.10% 3.10% 3.10% Inflation rate 2.80% 2.25% 2.50% The assumptions used by the Actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
The fair value of the defined benefit schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the Schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: Long-term Value at Long-term Value at Long-term Value at rate of return 31 December rate of return 31 December rate of return 31 December expected at 2003 expected at 2002 expected at 2001 31 December 000 31 December 000 31 December 000 2003 2002 2001 Equities 6.50% 79,908 6.50% 67,921 6.75% 85,175 Bonds 4.50% 33,108 4.50% 27,340 4.75% 26,228 Other 4.50% 949 4.50% 1,077 4.75% 1,951 113,965 96,338 113,354 The following amounts at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS17: 2003 2002 000 000 Total market value of assets 113,965 96,338 Present value of Scheme liabilities 159,740 142,270 Deficit in the Scheme 45,775 45,932 Related deferred tax asset 13,733 13,780 Net pension liability 32,042 32,152 60 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2003 31 Pension scheme continued If the above amounts had been recognised in the Financial Statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 would be as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Net assets excluding pension liability 218,148 202,746 Net pension liability 32,042 32,152 Net assets including pension liability 186,106 170,594 Profit and loss reserve excluding pension liability 138,433 123,495 Net pension liability 32,042 32,152 Profit and loss reserve including pension liability 106,391 91,343 The method of calculating the net pension asset or liability under FRS17 is likely to lead to volatility in the amounts to be included in the Groups balance sheet and the profit and loss account financing charge when this accounting standard is fully adopted.
The Scheme assets, the majority of which are equities, are potentially subject to significant market movements.
At 31 December 2003, the FTSE All Share Index was at its highest point in the year.
Its lowest point during the year was 27.8% below the value at the balance sheet date.
The Schemes liabilities are measured by reference to long-term AA corporate bond yields that can again move significantly and according to market conditions.
The yield on the AA corporate bond index used was in the range 5.10% to 5.60% in the year ended 31 December 2003.
"The following amounts would have been recognised in the performance statements in the year ended 31 December 2003 under the requirements of FRS17: 2003 2002 000 000 Operating profit: Current service cost 4,664 3,853 Gain on curtailment relating to disposal and termination of business - 541 4,664 3,312 Other finance income net : Expected return on pension scheme assets 5,655 7,049 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 7,873 7,763 Net return 2,218 714 Consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses ""STRGL"" Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 13,283 22,825 Experience gains and losses arising on the Scheme liabilities 5,837 2,666 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the Scheme liabilities 2,014 8,031 Actuarial gain recognised in STRGL 5,432 28,190 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2003 61 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Pension scheme continued A reconciliation of the movement in the deficit during the year is set out below: 000 Deficit in the Scheme at 1 January 2003 45,932 Movement in year: Current service cost 4,664 Contributions 1,607 Other finance income net 2,218 Actuarial gain 5,432 Deficit in the Scheme at 31 December 2003 45,775 Details of experience gains and losses were: 2003 2002 000 000 Difference between the expected and actual return on the Scheme assets 13,283 22,825 Percentage of the Scheme assets 12% 24% Experience gains and losses on the Scheme liabilities 5,837 2,666 Percentage of the present value of the Scheme liabilities 4% 2% Total amount recognised in the STRGL 5,432 28,190 Percentage of the present value of the Scheme liabilities 3% 20% The Directors have concluded that it is not practicable to allocate the assets and liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension plan to the Company."
