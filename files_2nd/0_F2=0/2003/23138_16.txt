At the year end, the company has surplus loan relationship losses being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable and surplus management expenses totaling 43,077,560 200234,702,575.
These have been generated because such a large part of the companys income is derived from dividends from UK companies.
Such dividend income does not fall to be taxed within the corporation tax regime and the company therefore has very little income against which to deduct its expenses and finance costs.
These losses are not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that future period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these losses.

Risk management The major risks associated with the company are market risk, gearing risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The company has established a framework for managing these risks which is evolving continually as the companys investment activities change in response to market developments.
The board has provided the manager with guidelines and limits for the management of gearing, investments and financial instruments.
Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, valuations accorded to equities, movements in prices and the liquidity of financial instruments.
Market price risk is managed through investment guidelines agreed by the board with the manager and is discussed at each board meeting.
It is the companys policy to increase its exposure to equity market price risk through the investment of borrowings, thus increasing the opportunity for growth of assets in rising markets but also the risk when markets fall.
The downside risk may be reduced by increasing the level of cash balances through the sale of equities or by the use of derivatives.
All of the companys long term debt is fixed rate, which exposes the company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft and short term borrowing facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is shown in note 12.
Financial assets and liabilities The companys financial instruments comprise equity investments, derivative contracts, treasury bills, AAA money market funds, cash balances, debenture stocks and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement.
Fixed asset investments see note 9 are valued at middle market prices which equate to their fair values.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities are represented by their carrying values in the balance sheet.
