Two of the schemes are defined contribution.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the Group to both schemes and amounted to 1,010,000 2002 933,000.
The third scheme, the Stanley Leisure 1988 Retirement Benefit Scheme, is a defined benefit scheme which provides benefits based on final pensionable earnings.
Membership has not been offered since 2 February 2001 and the scheme is, therefore, effectively closed to new entrants.
This has not affected the status or rights of existing members.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the Profit and Loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The pension charge for the year in respect of the Group for the defined benefit scheme was 524,000 2002 588,000.
The contributions are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age valuation method.
The most recent formal valuation was at 1 February 2001.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 7,890,000 and the actuarial value of these assets represented 116% of the value of benefits which had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The main assumptions which affect the results of the valuation include an assumed rate of future investment returns of 7.25% per annum during the period prior to a members retirement and 5.75% per annum during the period post retirement: an assumed rate of future salary growth of 4% per annum and for pensions in payment which increase each year by 5% or the change in the R. P. I. if less an assumed rate of increase of 2.75% per annum.
FRS 17 The last full actuarial valuation of the Stanley Leisure 1988 Retirement Benefit Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 February 2001 and updated on an approximate basis to 27 April 2003.
The contributions payable by the employer as shown above are equivalent to 11% of pensionable salaries.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 17 require disclosure of assets and liabilities as at 27 April 2003 calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
They also require disclosure of the items which would appear in the Profit and Loss account and in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses were the full requirements of FRS 17 in place.
For the purpose of these financial statements, all of these figures are illustrative only and do not impact on the actual 27 April 2003 Balance Sheet or on this years performance statements.
