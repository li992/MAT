During the year, the Group invested 6.4 million in Cycladic Catalyst, an open-ended offshore company, as part of its investment portfolio of hedge other funds.
At the time the investment was made it was understood that the Groups share of the voting rights would be below 50% based on anticipated investment by other third parties.
However, at 31 March 2003, based on the funds raised by this investee company and owing to matters outside the control of the Group, the Groups share was 78.6% and accordingly the holding qualifies as a subsidiary undertaking.
The Group has not consolidated this holding as the situation whereby the Groups share of the voting rights exceeds 50% is considered to be temporary.
The Group does not and will not exert control over the financial and operating policies of this investee company.
The investment is valued at 6.8 million at 31 March 2003 in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for its investments.

RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts 51 51 29 PENSION COMMITMENTS J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Scheme.
The Scheme has two parts: a defined benefit section which is closed to new members and money purchase arrangements which have been set up for Lord Rothschild.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the RITCP Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2002 and the report was produced using the projected unit method of funding using the following assumptions: Annual compound rate Investment return 6.50% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% Inflation assumption 2.00% This report showed assets valued at 5.188 million and a projected deficit of 1.177 million as at 1 January 2002.
The employer contribution rate to the scheme for the period from 1 April 2002 to 30 June 2002 was 34% of pensionable salaries and the rate was increased to 35% for the period from 1 July 2002 to 31 March 2003.
An additional contribution of 0.42 million was made in July 2002 and a further payment of 0.4 million was made in April 2003.
An additional contribution of 0.2 million was made in February 2002.
The funding rate in respect of the money purchase arrangements was 20% of pensionable salary.
No changes have been made to these funding rates to date.
Since the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the service costs as a percentage of pensionable salary, calculated using the projected unit method, would be expected to increase as the current membership approaches retirement.
The pension contributions made during the year are analysed below: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2003 2002 000 000 Defined benefit scheme annual contributions 340 331 additional contribution 420 200 Money purchase scheme 64 62 Personal pension schemes 137 131 961 724 In accordance with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benefits FRS17, this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of assets held.
