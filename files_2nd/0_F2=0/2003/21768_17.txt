Investments continued b Quasi-subsidiaries - continued ii Secured funding On 3 August 2003 a quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Legaless Ltd, was assigned equitable title to a 1.0 billion portfolio of residential mortgage assets from Mortgage Express, a subsidiary of the Group.
Mortgage Express and the Group continue to be exposed to the risk that the principal amount and interest receivable on the mortgage loans are not collectable.

Derivatives and other financial instruments a Financial instruments and risk management The Groups core business is to provide its customers with financial products appropriate to their needs, from mortgages and savings accounts to long-term investment products and insurance products.
The Group uses wholesale financial instruments to invest in liquid assets and to raise funds from wholesale money markets in support of its retail savings and mortgage operations.
These instruments also allow it to manage the risks arising from these business activities.
The Group has a well established formal structure for managing risks which includes formal risk policies, risk limits, reporting structures, mandates and control procedures.
The Groups approach to risk management and control is set out within the Financial Review on pages 20 to 21.
The Board delegates the management of all aspects of market and liquidity risk to the Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO.
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include off-balance sheet or derivative instruments.
Such instruments are used only to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
As part of its responsibilities, ALCO approves the use of specified off-balance sheet instruments within approved limits and business activities.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued a Financial instruments and risk management continued The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes and consequently all off-balance sheet financial instruments are classified as hedging contracts.
The principal off-balance sheet instruments used by the Group in managing its balance sheet risk exposures are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures arising principally from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, fixed rate savings products, deposit funding, foreign currency exposure and investment activities.
The duration of off-balance sheet contracts is generally short to medium-term and their maturity profile reflects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business activities.
At the year end the Group had no net material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations or changes in foreign currency interest rates.

Although net interest income tends to benefit from a positive gap when interest rates are rising and a negative gap when rates are falling, the actual effect will depend upon a number of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date.

Retirement benefits a Pension schemes The Company operates a funded defined benefit staff pension scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Staff Pension Scheme the principal scheme, administered by trustees, which is a closed scheme.
The fund is independent from those of the Company.
The normal pension age of employees in the scheme is 60 years.
Pension costs in the principal scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 October 2003.
The aggregate actuarial value of the schemes assets was sufficient to cover 110% of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets held at 31 October 2003 was 352.6 million.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The rate of return on investments has been assumed to exceed the rate of salary increases by 2.75% per annum and to exceed the rate of present and future pensions increase by 3.25% per annum.
This latter assumption is different from that used by the Company and Trustees in determining the contribution rate to the scheme where the investment return is assumed to exceed the rate of pension increase by 2.25% per annum.
The pension charge takes account of the surpluses disclosed, which are amortised over a period of 11.5 years, being the estimated average remaining service life of pension scheme members.
The Group also operates two further defined benefit schemes which are not material.
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Group Pension Plan.
The total pension cost for the Group was 13.0m 2002: 10.7m and included 0.2m 2002: 0.2m in respect of pensions to former Directors which was charged to other administrative expenses.
There were no liabilities or prepayments associated with the defined contribution scheme at the year end 2002: Nil.
b Other post-retirement benefits The Company provides concessionary rate mortgages and health care benefits to some of its pensioners.
The cost of health care benefits is provided for in accordance with the stated accounting policy.
The cost of concessionary rate mortgages is not significant and is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account as it is incurred.

Interest rates used for transfer pricing have been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury.
Costs have been assigned to each segment based on resources consumed.
Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage origination by the Distribution segment has been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
b Exceptionals have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of Group-level decisions.
c For the purposes of segmental information net assets have been allocated to Lending, Savings and Distribution on the basis of the regulatory capital framework.
The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business, therefore segmental profits do not relate to these net assets.
d The Group operates entirely within the retail financial services sector and accordingly no segmental analysis of turnover has been presented.
Please refer to the Financial Review for more information on segmental performance.
