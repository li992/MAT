Description of Exels segmental analysis Exels segmental analysis splits logistics activities between contract logistics and freight management.
Contract logistics includes ground-based supply chain management services, such as integrated warehousing and transportation, just-in-time services, sub-assembly and other value added activities.
Freight management includes airfreight and seafreight forwarding, customs broking, transportation management including US road and rail and specialist mail and express services.
Due to the comprehensive range of services provided to customers within individual contracts there are some cross-overs between these two segments but these are relatively small.
Discontinued operations are BRS Taskforce which was sold in 2003, and the German chilled food logistics business which was closed in 2002.
Non-operating net liabilities comprise other investments, net debt, taxation, dividends and net pension assets and liabilities.

As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount not provided is 13.8m 2002: 14.4m.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
In the past, the Group has incurred significant tax losses in certain overseas jurisdictions, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
The Group has therefore not recognised a deferred tax asset of 37.7m 2002: 42.7m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
In addition, the Group has generated significant UK capital losses from disposals in previous years.
Such losses are only available to offset certain UK capital profits arising in future periods and it is expected to be some time before these losses are relieved.
Accordingly, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 15.6m 2002: 16.3m on these losses.

The disclosures below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets Floating rate financial assets are bank balances on which interest is received at interest rates fixed in advance for periods ranging up to six months, based on the relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
Nil rate financial assets are mainly investments.

There were no significant differences between the book values and fair values of long-term creditors, cash at bank and in hand, current asset investments and unlisted other investments.
The fair values of all other items have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The sterling equivalent of the forward foreign exchange buy contracts was 277.2m 2002: 203.1m and of the sell contracts was 843.6m 2002: 729.1m expiring over a maximum period of one year 2002: one year.
Notes to the financial statements Exel plc Annual Report 2003 70 18 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Currency risk Structural currency exposures As explained in the financial review on page 46, the Groups objective in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas is to hedge these exposures with a combination of currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts.
Exchange gains and losses arising from structural currency exposures, net of hedges, are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Transactional currency exposures Transactional currency exposures arise from trading transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business.
These exposures give rise to currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Group carries on a significant amount of intra-group activity across the world.
To control the currency exposures arising from this trading activity, Exels treasury function Group Treasury operates an inter-company netting system which passes the non-functional currency exchange risk to Group Treasury.
The residual exchange risks are hedged by Group Treasury using forward foreign currency contracts.
The net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are shown below: US Dollar Euro Other Total Functional currency of group operation m m m m 31 December 2003 Sterling 10.5 1.5 16.5 7.5 31 December 2002 Sterling 1.5 1.1 5.8 6.2 Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
There are no deferred gains or losses at 31 December 2003 2002: nil.

Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.
No contributions have been made during the financial year.
The actuaries have recommended the continued suspension of the Groups contributions to the Ocean Nestor Pension Scheme until at least the conclusion of the March 2006 valuation.
Contributions of 10m per annum will be paid in respect of the Exel Retirement Plan for the next three years, commencing 1 January 2004.
As from 1 April 2003, the existing defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been closed to new employees.
Defined contribution sections have been established for new employees after this date within the existing schemes.
The service cost has been assessed using the projected unit method, and so the service cost for the closed defined benefit sections is expected to increase as a percentage of pay as the membership approaches retirement, though this is expected to be offset by the reducing number of members in these sections.
The values of overseas schemes liabilities at 31 December 2003 have been assessed by local actuaries.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes outside the UK.
The disclosures for all of the Groups defined benefit arrangements are aggregated below.
Overseas assets and liabilities are included, but are not material to the totals.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the group schemes in which it is a participating employer.

29 Impact of changes in accounting policies The adoption of FRS 17 Retirement benefits has resulted in the following restatements to prior year results: 1.
In the year ended 31 December 2002 a an increase in the pension charge of 70.0m within operating profit, b the inclusion of other finance income of 60.5m, c a decrease in the tax charge of 2.9m, d a decrease in the profit for the year of 6.6m, e a decrease in the total recognised gains and losses of 328.0m, and 2.
At 31 December 2002 a a reduction in deferred taxation within provisions for liabilities and charges of 106.9m, b an increase in deferred tax assets within debtors: amounts falling due after more than one year of 1.4m, c a reduction in pension prepayments with debtors: amounts falling due after more than one year of 361.0m, d the inclusion of net pension assets and liabilities of 41.3m net of deferred tax of 17.7m, e a decrease in reserves of 211.4m.
The impact of adopting the amendment to FRS 5 Revenue recognition on turnover and profit on ordinary activities for both the current and prior year was immaterial.
Following the introduction of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, the Group has changed its accounting policy for own shares.
Previously, investments in own shares were included in fixed assets at cost less accumulated amortisation, unless there was seen to have been a permanent diminution in value in which case the investments were written down to realisable value.
In accordance with UITF 38, the cost of such shares is now treated as a deduction from shareholders equity.
The impact of this change in accounting policy has been to reduce investments by 17.6m, increase reserves by 1.3m and reduce shareholders equity by 18.9m as at 31 December 2002 as prior year adjustments.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account for either the current or prior year.
