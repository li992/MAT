The groups overseas tax rates are lower than those in the UK due primarily to the profits earned by the Irish subsidiaries and no significant changes are expected in the Irish tax rates.
The tax relief on loss on exchange is not expected to continue in the future.

The policy is to ensure that forecast net borrowings plus a reasonable operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
At the balance sheet date 260.0m 2002: 150.0m remained undrawn on the revolving credit facility.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2003 was as follows: Group Group Company Company 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m In one year or less, or on demand 58.4 47.5 57.6 45.8 In more than one year but not more than two years 16.6 7.9 16.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 202.2 300.0 202.2 300.0 In more than five years 90.5 90.3 90.5 90.3 Total borrowings 367.7 445.7 366.3 436.1 Further details of the groups facilities are set out in note 21.
Interest rate risk The group manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings by operating with a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The objective for the mix of fixed and floating rate is to operate with fixed rate borrowings within a range of 20 per cent to 50 per cent of total borrowings over the medium term, although the group may operate outside of that range during the year.
The groups fixed rate debt is based principally on the 91.28m 6.75 per cent convertible subordinated bonds 2008 detailed in note 21.
The group does not use derivatives for interest rate management.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The book value of the convertible subordinated bonds was 90.5m 2002: 90.3m and the fair value was 91.4m 2002: 90.3m based on the quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts by reference to market exchange rates at the balance sheet date was a cost of 1.7m 2002: nil.
The book value of other financial assets and liabilities approximates to fair value due to their short maturities.
Currency exposure The group operates primarily in the UK with only approximately 13.6 per cent of sales arising from companies operating in currencies other than sterling, principally the euro, giving rise to an exposure to the euro.
Group policy is to hedge against transactional risk, by spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, but not to hedge against translation.
The average and closing rates used in the accounts to translate euro to sterling were 11.559 1 and 11.4581 1 respectively 2002: 11.62 1 and 11.6323 1.

Interest is payable at the rate of 6.75 per cent per annum semi-annually on 8 February and 8 August in each year.
The bonds were originally convertible into ordinary shares of the company at 326p per ordinary share.
Following the demerger of the Dairy business in March 1998, the conversion price was adjusted to 225p in accordance with the trust deed.
The company has had the option, since 31 August 1998, to redeem the bonds in multiples of 10m, at their principal price.
Revolving credit facility 2006 The five year syndicated revolving credit facility for 450m was entered into in September 2001.
At 31 March 2003 borrowings under this facility were 190.0m.
These borrowings are repayable in periods of up to one year but are capable of being immediately refinanced as part of the committed revolving credit facility.
Loan notes Loan notes due within one year include 5.9m which bear interest by reference to London Inter-Bank market rates.
These can be redeemed in amounts of 100 or multiples thereof at their nominal principal amount semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December each year.
Loan notes not previously redeemed will be redeemed at their nominal amount by 31 December 2003.
Other loan notes due within one year include 0.3m which bear interest at 1 per cent below the base rate.
They can be redeemed in amounts of 10,000 or multiples thereof at their nominal principal amount semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December each year.
Loan notes not previously redeemed will be redeemed at their nominal amount by 30 June 2005.
Other loans Other loans of 43.2m arise from the issue of preference shares by a subsidiary to a third party undertaking.
This would normally be disclosed as a minority interest but in accordance with paragraph 49 of FRS 4, has been disclosed as a liability.
Interest is payable on the loan by reference to LIBOR.
Other facilities and interest rates At 31 March 2003, the group had in place other uncommitted facilities with a number of banks which totalled 80.0m 2002: 104.0m.
The groups borrowings under the revolving credit and uncommitted facilities bear interest at rates which generally fluctuate in line with market rates.

The assets of the Scheme are held in trustee administered funds separate from the finances of the group.
SSAP 24 The pension cost relating to the Scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit method.
For the purposes of determining pension costs the most significant assumptions adopted were as follows: Rate of increase in pensionable earnings 3.9 per cent per annum Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.8 per cent per annum Rate of investment return 7.3 per cent per annum The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2002 using a market based approach.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 449.9m which represented 95 per cent of the value of accrued benefits allowing for assumed future increases in earnings on the basis of the assumptions adopted for that valuation.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the groups pension schemes are based on actuarial valuations carried out at 31 March 2002.
This does not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock markets since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next triennial valuation, based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until adoption of FRS 17.
The contribution rate for the year ended 31 March 2003 was 12.7 per cent of pensionable earnings and the agreed contribution rate for the next 2 years is 12.7 per cent of pensionable earnings.
FRS 17 Additional disclosure regarding the groups defined benefit schemes are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at 31 March 2003 by an independent, qualified actuary, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
For the purposes of determining the Scheme liabilities under FRS 17 the most significant assumptions adopted were as follows: 2003 2002 % % Rate of increase of salaries 3.6 3.9 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.5 2.8 Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.0 3.0 Discount rate 5.9 6.3 Inflation assumption 2.6 2.9 The fair value of the assets in the Scheme, together with those of the overseas schemes, the present value of the liabilities and the expected rate of return at 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 were as follows: 2003 2002 Long term Long term expected rate expected rate of return 2003 of return 2002 %m %m Equities 8.3 264.7 8.3 370.6 Bonds 5.0 103.7 6.0 100.0 Other 4.0 29.0 5.0 3.1 Total fair value of assets 397.4 473.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 600.9 540.9 Deficit in scheme 203.5 67.2 Related deferred tax asset 60.0 20.2 Net pension deficit 143.5 47.0 Northern Foods plc Notes to the accounts | 41 Notes to the accounts continued 25 Pensions continued If the group had adopted FRS 17 early, the groups profit and loss account reserve at 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 would have been restated as follows: 2003 2002 m m Group profit and loss account reserve excluding pension deficit 148.2 70.4 Pension deficit 143.5 47.0 SSAP 24 prepayment 47.4 33.6 Deferred tax on SSAP 24 prepayment 14.1 10.0 Group profit and loss account reserve 28.6 0.2 The amounts charged to operating profit under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2003 m Current service cost 20.4 Net operating charge 20.4 The amounts credited to net finance income under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2003 m Expected return on pension scheme assets 37.3 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 34.3 Net finance income 3.0 The amounts included within the groups statement of total recognised gains and losses under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2003 m Difference between actual and expected return on scheme assets 127.9 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 7.0 Effects of changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 23.0 Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in groups statement of total recognised gains and losses 143.9 Deferred tax movement 42.3 Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in groups statement of total recognised gains and losses net of deferred tax 101.6 The movement in deficit during the year under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2003 m Deficit in scheme at the beginning of the year 67.2 Movement in year: Current service cost 20.4 Contributions 25.4 Other finance income 3.0 Exchange adjustments 0.4 Actuarial loss 143.9 Deficit in scheme at the end of the year 203.5 Related deferred tax asset 60.0 Net pension deficit at the end of the year 143.5 42 | Notes to the accounts Northern Foods plc 25 Pensions continued The experience gains and losses under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2003 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 127.9 Percentage of scheme assets % 32.2 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 7.0 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities % 1.2 Total actuarial gain or loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount m 143.9 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities % 23.9 26 Financial commitments Capital expenditure authorised by the directors and to which the group and the company are contracted amounts to 1.0m 2002: 6.6m for the group and nil 2002: nil for the company.
