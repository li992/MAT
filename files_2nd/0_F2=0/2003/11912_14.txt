The current tax charge for the year is different from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%.
The differences are explained below: All gures in millions 2003 2002 profit loss before tax 152 25 Expected charge benefit at UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2002: 30% 46 8 Effect of overseas tax rates 8 11 Effect of tax losses 5 7 Timing differences 64 55 Non-deductible goodwill amortisation 90 111 US state taxes 4 10 Adjustments in respect of prior years and other items 13 56 Current tax charge benefit for the year 60 2 84 Notes to the accounts continued 7 Taxation continued All gures in percentages 2003 2002 Taxrate reconciliation UK tax rate 30.0 30.0 Effect of overseas tax rates 1.3 2.8 Other items 0.1 Taxrate reected in adjusted earnings 31.2 32.8 Note Both the current and the total tax charge on profit or loss before tax will continue to be affected by the fact that there is only very limited tax relief available on the goodwill amortisation charged in the accounts.
The current tax charge will continue to be affected by the utilisation of tax losses and by the impact of other timing differences, in both cases mainly in the United States.
Following the adoption of FRS 19 these factors will have only a very limited impact on the total tax rate: asshown in note 21, the Group has recognised a total deferred tax asset of 145m at 31 December 2003 2002: 174m.
In both 2003 and 2002 the tax charge was materially affected by adjustments in respect to prior years: it is not practicable to forecast the possible effect of such items in future years as this will depend on progress in agreeing the Groups taxreturns with the tax authorities.
The total charge in future years will also be affected by any changes to corporation tax rates and or any other relevant legislative changes in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and by the mix of profits between the different jurisdictions.

Consequently, the effect of share options was anti-dilutive and there was no difference between the loss per share and the diluted loss per share.
There is no difference between the profit for the financial year and the diluted profit for the financial year.
Therefore the diluted earnings per share is 6.9p 2002: a loss of 13.9p.
The weighted average number of shares in 2003 is lower than in 2002 as a result of own shares purchased to hedge share schemes.
85 10a Employee information The details of the emoluments of the directors of Pearson plc are shown on pages 55 to 69.
The major schemes are self-administered with the schemes assets being held independently of the Group.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries.
The UK scheme is a hybrid scheme with both dened benefit and dened contribution sections but, predominantly, consisting of dened benefit liabilities.
There are a number of dened contribution schemes, principally overseas.
The cost of the schemes is as follows: All gures in millions 2003 2002 UK Group scheme Regular pension cost Dened benefit sections 10 11 Dened contribution sections 7 7 Variation cost 6 23 18 Other schemes Dened benefit schemes 7 6 Dened contribution schemes 27 30 34 36 57 54 Note From 1 January 2003 the UK Group scheme only offers dened contribution benets to new joiners.
The main US dened benefit scheme was closed to the majority of active members in 2001.
The changesto these schemes will give rise to a reduction in dened benefit and an increase in dened contribution costs.
86 Notes to the accounts continued 10b Pensions continued Included in note 22, there is a pension provision of 29m 2002: 36m as measured in accordance with SSAP 24.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Group scheme was performed as at 1 January 2001 using the projected unit method of valuation.
This valuation has been updated to 1 January 2003 for the purposesof determining the 2003 SSAP 24 cost for the UK Group scheme.
The market value of the assets of the scheme at 1 January 2003 was 976m.
The major assumptions used to determine the SSAP 24 charge are as follows: UK Group All gures in percentages scheme Ination 2.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 Rate of ination-linked increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.5 Return on investments 7.0 Level of funding 96.0 The funding policy differs from the accounting policy to the extent that more conservative assumptions are used for funding purposes.
Furthermore, in 2003 the Group paid an additional one-off contribution of 5m into the scheme which was designed to ensure that the scheme was fully funded.
The next full triennial valuation is due to be carried out as at 1 January 2004.
The date of the most recent valuation of the US plan was 31 December 2002.
FRS 17 disclosures The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 for the Groups dened benefit schemes and the UK Group hybrid scheme are set out below.
The disclosures for the UK Group hybrid scheme are in respect of both the dened benefit and dened contribution sections.
For the purpose of these disclosures, the latest full actuarial valuations of the UK Group scheme and other schemes have been updated by independent actuaries to 31 December 2003.
The assumptions used are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other schemes.

The FRS 17 measurement date is 31 December 2003.
Although the rise in stock markets in 2003 increased the market value of the UK Group scheme assets, this is more than offset by the increase in the present value of the UK Group scheme liabilities, which is largely caused by the fall in bond yields and increase in the ination assumption in 2003.
This has resulted in an increased deficit in the UK Group scheme under FRS 17.
