Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of the parent Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
In the case of acquisitions or disposals, the Groups result includes that proportion from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal as appropriate.
Goodwill With effect from 1 April 1998, where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement via annual impairment reviews or an annual amortisation charge will be determined based on the individual circumstances of each business acquired.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 is not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.
When a business is disposed of, goodwill, where applicable, is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account.
Joint ventures The results attributable to the Companys holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The amount included in the consolidated balance sheet is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
Turnover Turnover represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year.
On traditional developments, properties are treated as sold and profits are taken when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
On complex multi-unit developments, revenue and profit are recognised on a staged basis, commencing when the building work is substantially complete, which is dened as being plastered and when contracts are exchanged.
Tangible xed assets Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% Fixtures and ttings 15% 20% 1 Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 3% Leasehold property is amortised over the period of the lease.
Computer equipment is included within xtures and ttings.
Stocks Property in the course of development is valued at the lower of direct cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads and interest.
Progress payments are deducted from work in progress.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable and have not been discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
s Financial instruments From time to time the Group makes use of interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to uctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate instruments are treated as hedges and the net interest payable or receivable is reected in the profit and loss account.
Pension costs The expected cost of providing pensions is recognised on a systematic basis over the period during which benefit is derived from the employees services.
Pension contributions under dened contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Leasing and rental agreements Payments under rental and operating lease agreements are charged against profit in the periods in which they become due.
38 The Berkeley Group plc Annual Report 2003 1 Accounting policies continued Long term executive incentive schemes and plan Provision is made to match the cost of shares provisionally allocated in respect of any year to participants under the Groups long term executive incentive schemes and plan.
Similar provision is also made each year regarding the appropriate proportion of any estimated potential cash benefit which could arise, based on the probability of the relevant performance targets being met at the end of the relevant period.

The Berkeley Group plc Staff Benets Plan the Berkeley Final Salary Plan is a dened benefit scheme and was closed to new entrants from 1 May 2002.
The Berkeley Group plc Money Purchase Scheme the Berkeley Money Purchase Plan, the St George PLC Retirement and Death Benets Scheme the St George Scheme and the Thirlstone Homes Limited Retirement Benets Scheme the Thirlstone Scheme are dened contribution schemes.
The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recent valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2001.
The method adopted in the 2001 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment prior to and after retirement of 6.5% and 5.5% per annum respectively, pension increases for service before and after April 1997 of 3.0% and 2.5% per annum respectively and salary escalation at 3.5% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2001 was 13,956,000 and was sufficient to cover 79% of the schemes liabilities.
Employers contributions are currently paid at 15% and it is proposed to maintain this level of contribution thereby reducing the deficit to zero over the expected remaining service life of existing members.
Contributions amounting to 1,356,000 2002: 1,111,000 were paid into the dened contribution schemes during the year, representing the appropriate level of dened funding.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benets, the required disclosures relating to the Berkeley Final Salary Plan are set out below.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 May 2001, and updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 30 April 2003.

The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is 83,185,000 2002: 63,063,000.
9 Earnings per Ordinary Share Earnings per Ordinary Share is based on the profit after taxation of 154,684,000 2002: 136,829,000 and the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year of 133,404,586 2002: 129,910,482 adjusted to exclude shares held by the Company to satisfy awards under its long term incentive plan.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares relate to shares granted under employee share schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Ordinary Shares during the year.
The effect of the dilutive potential shares is 998,783 shares 2002: 315,467, giving a diluted weighted average number of shares of 134,403,369 2002: 130,225,949.
Net assets per Ordinary Share is calculated based on net assets at the end of the year divided by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue at the end of the year of 127,425,071 2002: 134,963,049.
This excludes shares held by the Company to satisfy awards under its long term incentive plan.
Return on Capital Employed ROCE is calculated based on profit before interest and tax divided by the average shareholders funds plus net debt.

The Group nances its operations by a combination of retained profits and net borrowings.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash at bank and in hand, bank loans and overdrafts, loan stock, xed asset investments, debtors and creditors.

The main types of instruments used from time to time are interest swaps and caps.
During the year and at the year end the Group held no such instruments 2002: nil.
