Pension costs The Group operates both funded dened benefit and funded dened contribution pension schemes.
The funded dened contribution schemes are in the UK, Denmark and Sweden.
Overseas schemes are administered in accordance with local law and practice.
The major pension schemes in the UK, US, Denmark and Sweden together cover the majority of scheme members throughout the Group and the assets of these schemes are mainly held in separate trustee administered funds.
Each of the major dened benefit schemes is subject to regular valuation using the projected unit or other appropriate method which is the basis of the pension cost in the Consolidated profit and Loss Account, the cost being spread over employees working lives.
In April 2002, the UK schemes were effectively closed to new entrants following the introduction of a new dened contribution scheme.
In 2004 members of the UK dened benefit schemes have the option of paying contributions, initially at the rate of 2.5% of pensionable salaries, to maintain future benefit accrual on the current basis, or pay no contributions and have a reduced rate of future benefit accrual.
The total pension cost for the Group in 2003 was 108m 2002 94m of which 48m 2002 43m related to dened benefit schemes in the UK and 12m 2002 9m related to schemes in the US.
Contributions of 3m were made to the dened contribution schemes in the UK and 28m 2002 20m were made to the dened contribution scheme in Denmark and Sweden.
Independent qualied actuaries carry out valuations of the major schemes.
At the most recent formal actuarial valuations of the major dened benefit schemes the two main UK schemes 31 March 2002 and 30 June 2002 respectively, and the US scheme 1 January 2003, for the purpose of assessing pension costs, the market value of the assets of these schemes was 3,793m 2002 3,858m.
Of this amount, 3,568m related to the two UK schemes and on their valuation dates were sufficient to cover 110% and 101% respectively of the benets accrued to members of each of those schemes, after allowing for projected increases in earnings and pensions.
The valuations for the two major UK schemes were based on assumptions that salaries increase by 4.3% and 4.0% plus allowances for promotional salary increases, pensions increase by 2.9% and 2.5% and investment returns are 7.1% pa pre retirement and 5.6% post retirement for one scheme and 6.5% for the other.
For the two main UK schemes, the level of contributions in 2003 were 23% and 20% of salaries respectively with arrears of contribution at these rates back to the respective valuation dates, plus an amount of 20m in respect of one of the schemes where there was a deficit on the valuation funding basis.
In 2004, contributions will continue at the rates of 23% and 20% respectively plus an amount of 43m will be paid.
Further valuations are due in 2004 when the position will be reviewed.
The amounts charged to the profit and Loss Account were the equivalent of 13.9% and 20% respectively of relevant UK earnings.
This charge reected a regular cost of 57m 2002 73m and a credit of 11m 2002 34m.
The credit arises from the amortisation of the actuarial surpluses in the funds after taking account of interest on balances between the Group and the funds.
For one scheme an actuarial surplus from the valuation is being applied to reduce pension costs by a level percentage of payroll over the estimated working lives of members of the respective schemes.
There are no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at 31 December 2003 except that included in prepayments is an amount of 10m 2002 81m provision resulting from the difference between the amounts charged to revenue and the amounts contributed to schemes in the UK, and in provisions an amount of 8m 2002 8m in respect of overseas schemes.
Other post retirement benets The Group provides post retirement healthcare benets to certain current and retired US and Canadian employees.
The estimated discounted present values of the unprovided accumulated obligations are calculated in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries.

Retirement benets continued At 31 December 2003 the unprovided accumulated obligation in the US is estimated at 4m 2002 15m.
The assumptions used for the charge to the profit and loss account assume a pre 65 premium ination for medical care initially of 10% reducing over eight years to 5% and a post 65 premium ination of 12% reducing over ten years to 5% 2002 13% reducing over 11 years to 4.25% and a discount rate of 6% 2002 6.5%.
The unprovided accumulated obligation in Canada is estimated at 5m 2002 5m assuming a premium ination for drugs of 8% 2002 8% reducing over ten years to 5% 2002 4%, 4% pa for hospital and 3% for medical care for one scheme, and 10% 2002 10% decreasing by 0.5% per year to 5% per year 2002 0.5% per year to 5% for the other scheme.
For dental care, premium ination of 4% and 5% is assumed for the respective schemes 2002 4% and 5% and a discount rate of 6.5% for both schemes 2002 6.75% for both schemes.
The benets are accounted for on a systematic basis over the remaining service lives of current employees, the cost in the year being 9m 2002 6m.
In Canada the costs of meeting the liability for these benets are expected to attract taxation relief when paid.
The total provision included in the Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet is 43m 2002 42m.

Methodology for calculations of longer term rate of return and comparison over a longer term The rates of investment return used for the longer term rate of return basis are reviewed annually and are set out below: 2003 2002 % % Pre tax returns assumed Fixed interest returns nominal 5.00 6.00 Equity returns nominal 7.50 9.00 Ination 2.50 3.00 These returns are applied to the average, over the year, of the investments directly attributable to shareholders and the general insurance technical provisions.
In each case, the element of shareholders funds has been determined by reference to the risk based capital that the directors judge is necessary to support the business.
The values of the investments are adjusted to reduce the effect of short term uctuations, while recognising such changes over the longer term.
The aggregate amount of investment return recognised under the longer term basis since 1 January 1994 amounts to 10.7bn.

Share capital continued Post rights issue adjustment to share options The Company completed a one for one rights issue on 16 October 2003, following which adjustments were made to the number of shares under option and to exercise prices, in accordance with the rules of the relevant share option schemes.
After consultation with the Companys auditors and the Inland Revenue, a method of adjustment was established.
As a result, numbers of shares under option were adjusted by a factor of 1.2380952381 and exercise prices were adjusted by a factor of 0.8076923077.
Employee savings related share option schemes At 31 December 2003, under employee savings related share option schemes, employees held options over 40,148,839 ordinary shares at option prices ranging from 66.2p 361.0p per share.
Under the schemes, options are granted with an option price set at a discount of 12% to 20% of the market value of the ordinary shares in the period immediately preceding the date of grant.
The options are normally exercisable within six months of the respective exercise date, which is set at three to seven years after the date of grant.
The Group makes use of the exemption in UITF abstract 17 revised 2000 and accordingly recognises no cost for the options.
The options are potentially exercisable between three and ten years after grant, with the exception of the US scheme in which the exercise of options can be accelerated by the performance of the US subsidiary.
These options are potentially exercisable between one and three years.

The rate of interest payable on the US$ bonds is 8.95% although the Company manages the overall interest cost through the use of derivative contracts.
At 31 December 2003 derivative contracts were in place which have the effect of converting the interest payable to a oating rate on US$25m until October 2004.
Additionally, banks have the right to convert US$50m to a oating rate on any interest payment date of the bonds.
The subordinated guaranteed Euro bonds c500m have a redemption date of 15 October 2019. c200m of the Euro bonds bear interest at a xed rate of 6.875% until 15 October 2009 and a oating rate thereafter.
c300m of the Euro bonds bear interest at a oating rate from the date of issue.
The Company has the option to repay the Euro bonds on specic dates from 15 October 2009.
The subordinated guaranteed loan has a redemption date of 18 February 2030.
The loan JPY25bn is denominated in yen but interest is payable at 5.14% in US dollars.
Derivative contracts are in place which convert the loan and interest payments to sterling at a xed rate of 6.99%.
Derivative contracts were also in place to reduce the xed cost on 75m of the loan: the counterparties have the option to cancel some of these contracts which may result in the Company paying a oating rate of interest in the future.
The bonds and the loan are contractually subordinated to all other creditors of the Company such that in the event of a winding up or of bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other creditors have been met.
Long term business provision The principal assumptions used to calculate the UK long term business provision for the main classes of business are: 2003 2002 Interest rates Life with profit 2.75% to 3.60% 3.15% to 3.60% Pensions with profit 4.15% to 5.00% 4.00% to 4.75% Annuities in payment 5.00% to 5.50% 5.20% to 5.50% Mortality rates Life with profit AM80, AF80 with adjustments AM80, AF80 with adjustments Pensions with profit AM80, AF80 with adjustments AM80, AF80 with adjustments Annuities in payment PMA92 PFA92 c 2020 with adjustments PMA92 PFA92 c 2020 with adjustments The valuation has been carried out principally using a gross premium method.
During the year the FSA has granted the two principal with profits companies waivers from certain aspects of the liability valuation rules, which inter alia, enabled them to use the gross premium method and has reduced their liabilities on the statutory solvency basis, with a corresponding increase in the Fund for Future Appropriations.
Generally accepted actuarial tables are used as appropriate in overseas long term business operations.
On 11 February 2003, the Group entered into an agreement with Unisys for the provision of administration services and support related functions to all of its UK Life subsidiaries.
This agreement was effective from 1 May 2003.
Accordingly, the costs set out in this agreement, together with the costs associated with non outsourced functions within the UK Life Operation, form the basis of the expense assumptions within the long term business provision in each of the UK Life subsidiaries.

Net deferred tax assets are principally attributable to discounting of claims reserves and unclaimed capital allowances in the UK.
No credit has been taken in the deferred tax provision for UK tax losses with an estimated tax value of 135m.
This amount comprises capital losses that arose prior to the merger of the Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance groups, the use of which is severely restricted by UK tax law.
The recoverability of any associated deferred tax asset is therefore considered unlikely.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of UK capital losses with an estimated value of 43m, or for non UK tax losses and other tax assets with a value of 226m including 212m in respect of the US as it is not considered likely that suitable profits will arise to absorb these losses in the near future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are discounted at rates reecting post tax yields to maturity that can be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates and in currencies similar to those of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The discount rates used are within the range of 1% to 5%.

Transactions with related parties A number of the directors, other key managers, their close families and entities under their control have general and or long term insurance policies with subsidiary companies of the Group.
Such policies are on normal commercial terms except that executive directors and key managers are entitled to special rates which are also available to other members of staff.
The Board has considered the financial effect of such insurance policies and other transactions with Group companies and has concluded that they are not material to the Group or the individuals concerned and, if disclosed, would not inuence decisions made by users of these financial statements.
The Board has also concluded that there are no transactions with other directors or key managers that are material to their own financial affairs.
Shareholders interest in long term business The total shareholders interest in long term business represents those assets which the directors assess to be the amount maintained in support of the long term business and comprises: Restated UK Scandinavia International 2003 2002 m m m m m Shareholders accrued interest 321 321 71 Value of long term business 86 Shareholders funds 372 316 25 713 905 693 316 25 1,034 1,062 Less attributed to general business 300 100 734 962 As described in note 1, in 2003 the Group changed its accounting policy on the recognition of the internally generated value of long term insurance business.
The value of the long term insurance business at 31 December 2003 was 501m 2002 898m, excluding shareholders accrued interest of 321m 2002 71m.
This represents the amount considered by the directors, based on internal actuarial advice, to be a prudent value of the shareholders interest in the long term business funds not already recognised under the modied statutory principles of profit recognition.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the value of the UK long term business are: 2003 2002 % % Investment return: Fixed interest 4.84 4.50 UK equities 7.34 7.00 Overseas equities 7.34 7.00 Expense ination 3.50 3.00 Discount rate including risk margins 8.40 8.20 Risk margin included within discount rate 5.00 5.00 The investment returns represent the underlying long term assumptions implicit in the calculation of the value of long term business.
