During the year 757 of the US dollar denominated 5.560 per cent voting convertible cumulative preference shares of US$50 each perpetual convertible shares were converted into 7,395 ordinary shares of 5p each.
The perpetual convertible shares were issued on terms that they could be converted at any time, at the shareholders option, into fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each of the Company on the basis of 9.77 ordinary shares of 5p each for every perpetual convertible share so converted.
The Company has the option, at any time when the total amount of perpetual convertible shares issued and outstanding is less than 10% of the amount originally issued and in any event on or after 29 July 2006, to redeem, in the first case, all but not some only and, in the second case, all or any of the perpetual convertible shares which remain issued and outstanding at that time.
Following agreement being reached with Bear Creek Inc. a corporate trustee administering certain Gates family trusts which controlled approximately 90 per cent of the US dollar denominated 4.344 per cent voting redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares of US$50 each redeemable convertible shares, the terms of the redeemable convertible shares, as contained in Tomkins Articles of Association, were amended at an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and at a separate class meeting of the holders of the redeemable convertible shares so that on 26 August 2003 all of the outstanding redeemable convertible shares were redeemed at a price of US$48.5 each the redemption.
None of the redeemable convertible shares were converted into ordinary shares of 5p each during the year.
The redeemable convertible shares had been issued on terms that they could be converted at any time, at the shareholders option, into fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each in the Company on the basis of 9.77 ordinary shares of 5p each for every redeemable convertible share so converted.
Prior to the redemption the Company would have been required to redeem, at a price of US$50 each, all of the redeemable convertible shares which remained issued and outstanding on 26 July 2006.
At the date of issue the conversion terms of the perpetual convertible shares were equivalent to an ordinary share price of 334p.
On a return of assets on liquidation or otherwise other than on redemption or repurchase of shares the assets of the Company available to shareholders will be applied first in repaying the capital paid up or credited as paid up thereon together with all arrears and accruals of dividend to the holders of the perpetual convertible shares and any other classes of shares ranking pari passu with the perpetual convertible shares as to capital.
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 59 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 22 SHARE CAPITAL continued Until such time as the shares are converted or redeemed, the holders of the perpetual convertible shares have a right to receive dividends at an annual rate of 5.560 per cent in preference to the holders of the ordinary shares.

UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts has been adopted during the year, which states that the consideration paid for shares in Tomkins plc, held by an ESOP trust on behalf of the Company, should be accounted for as a reduction in shareholders funds rather than as a xed asset investment.
Consideration paid for the purchase of own shares represents the cost of shares purchased by the Company.
UITF 38 requires any compensation expense related to share awards to be based on the intrinsic value of the awards.
In the past the compensation expense has been based on the cost of the shares purchased, which has been equal to the intrinsic value.
As a result of the adoption of UITF 38, net assets and shareholders funds at 31 December 2002 have decreased by 0.2 million.
Comparative gures have been restated accordingly.
The adoption had no impact on the Groups results in previous accounting periods, but resulted in a 0.2 million increase in operating profit in the current year.
Own shares represent the cost to the Tomkins Employee Share Trust the Trust of the Companys ordinary shares that it has acquired to meet the expected requirements of the share based compensation schemes described in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 34 to 36.
As at 3 January 2004, the Group was deemed to hold 2,628,859 of the Companys ordinary shares 31 December 2002 1,827,382 ordinary shares by way of the Trust with a market value of 7.1 million 31 December 2002 3.5 million.
As at 3 January 2004, the Company was deemed to hold 2,077,583 of its own ordinary shares 31 December 2002 1,257,778 ordinary shares by way of the Trust with a market value of 5.6 million 31 December 2002 2.4 million.
Dividends relating to the Companys ordinary shares held by the Trust have been waived with the exception of those that are payable to participants in the relevant schemes.
Following the agreement to sell Pegler Limited and the business and assets of Hattersley Newman Hender Limited subsequent to the year end, a provision of 51.4 million was charged to the profit and loss account for the resulting impairment of goodwill.
In addition to the above, the goodwill arising since 1 March 1973 on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings owned at 3 January 2004 written off against reserves, totals 1,054.8 million 31 December 2002 1,136.1 million.
24 RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The profit for the financial year in the accounts of the Company, after the receipt of 607.6 million of dividends from subsidiaries, amounted to 512.3 million 31 December 2002 loss of 2.1 million.

24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a comply with that standard.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 the Group has elected to defer full implementation of the standard until the year ended 31 December 2005.
Nevertheless, a number of items determined in accordance with FRS 17 must be disclosed.
These disclosures, to the extent not given under a, are set out in b for funded dened benefit schemes and in c for unfunded dened benefit schemes.
The disclosures in respect of post retirement benets other than pensions are set out in note 20. a SSAP 24 Disclosures As at 3 January 2004, the Group operates pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of its employees.
These plans are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country and include dened contribution and dened benefit plans.
In the case of the dened benefit plans, amounts are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of providing benets over employees service lives.
Further details on the schemes in the two principal countries the United Kingdom and the United States are set out below.
At 3 January 2004, pension related assets of 25.3 million 31 December 2002 23.6 million Company 3.1 million 31 December 2002 0.8 million and pension related liabilities of 53.4 million 31 December 2002 43.8 million Company 6.7 million 31 December 2002 6.1 million were included in debtors and creditors respectively.
United Kingdom The majority of plans in the United Kingdom are dened benefit in nature and provide benets based on final pensionable salary and length of service.
The assets of the plans are held by trustees in separate pension funds and day to day management of those assets is carried out by independent professional investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in Tomkins.
All plan assets are held by custodians who are independent of the investment managers and of Tomkins.
The latest actuarial valuations and formal reviews of the plans were carried out by independent consulting actuaries, with effective dates between April 2002 and September 2003 using the projected unit method of valuation, which includes allowance for future earnings growth.
Assets were valued at market value.
The principal assumptions used in valuing the scheme liabilities are set out in the tables on page 63.
At the dates of the latest formal actuarial valuations, the market value of the assets of the plans amounted to 174.5 million which was sufficient to cover 90 per cent 31 December 2002 81 per cent of the liabilities for benets accrued to members.
At 3 January 2004 total plan assets had a market value of approximately 186.0 million 31 December 2002 160.5 million.
Certain employees whose benets exceed the maximum that can be paid from the approved arrangements are entitled to an additional pension payable directly from the company following retirement.
An accrued liability of 2.7 million 31 December 2002 1.8 million is included in the balance sheet in respect of this.
There are a small number of dened contribution plans where contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they fall due.
United States of America Both dened benefit and dened contribution plans are operated in the United States of America.
Assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
Dened benefit plans are operated by a number of the Groups US subsidiaries providing benets based upon pensionable salary and length of service.
Actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities are performed annually by independent consulting actuaries, using the projected unit method of valuation which includes allowance for future earnings growth.
At 3 January 2004, total plan assets had a market value of 212.8 million 31 December 2002 226.1 million.
The actuarial valuation of the assets was sufficient to cover 84 per cent 31 December 2002 78 per cent of the estimated accrued liabilities of the funded plans.
Dened contribution plans, which include profit sharing plans, cover most of Tomkins US employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they fall due.
Other countries Over 60 per cent of Tomkins employees are either in the UK or in the US.
For the balance, Tomkins operates both dened benefit and dened contribution plans.
Where these are not available, state benets are considered adequate.
Full provision is made for liabilities arising under dened benefit schemes in these countries, as calculated in accordance with actuarial advice and contributions to dened contribution plans are accounted for in the year in which they fall due.

Accordingly, no adjustment for these schemes is necessary.
The assumptions used to derive the present value of scheme liabilities are broadly similar to those used for the funded schemes.
27 CONTINGENCIES The Company guarantees the bank facilities of certain subsidiaries and the Group provides cash as security for letters of credit in order to reduce their cost.
The maximum amount covered by these arrangements at 3 January 2004 was 156.2 million 31 December 2002 122.6 million and 3.8 million 31 December 2002 1.5 million respectively.
The Company has also guaranteed certain property leases and performance bonds entered into in the ordinary course of business by certain of its subsidiaries.
The Group is also, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business.

Net debt funds comprise cash and deposits, borrowings and off balance sheet contracts.
The borrowings and off balance sheet contracts shown against each currency are matched against the assets and liabilities of that currency under the requirements of SSAP 20 and to that extent produce no net gain or loss on translation into sterling for the purposes of the Group profit and loss account.
Net currency gains of 35 million 31 December 2002 2.3 million relating to net debt funds and foreign currency derivatives used to ensure that the Groups net borrowings are retained in proportion to the currencies in which the Groups net assets are denominated have been included in the foreign exchange translation movement in the profit and loss account.

Long term borrowings consist mainly of the 250 million and 150 million medium term notes, the fair values of which have been determined by reference to market rates.
Deposits are held short term and mainly attract oating rates.
Foreign currency derivatives are used to ensure that the Groups net borrowings are retained in proportion to the currencies in which the Groups assets are denominated.
These are marked to market and the resulting differences recognised, thereby avoiding significant divergence between book and fair values.
Where foreign currency cash ows generated by overseas investments have not been remitted to Tomkins plc at the time of dividend payment, forward contracts are used to ensure the currency prole of the Group is in line with policy.
Fair value of preference shares The above analysis excludes the details of the fair value of the preference shares.
These preference shares are not traded on an organised market and fair values are therefore not readily available.
Other details of the preference shares are given in note 22.
Hedges of future transactions Gains and losses on derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is recognised.
