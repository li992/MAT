26 Acquisition of businesses In August 2002 the Group gave notice to a subsidiary of Hachette Filipacchi Presse SA Hachette of its intention to dissolve Hachette Emap Magazines Limited.
This company owned the titles New Woman, Top Sant, Elle Girl and Red and published Elle and Elle Decoration under royalty free licences from Hachette.
As a result of the dissolution the Group purchased Hachettes share of New Woman and Top Sant and bought out the related minority interest for a cash consideration of 16m based on a valuation of 50% of these titles.
As part of this arrangement the Group made a disposal of the remaining titles, the details of which are given in Note 27.
During the year Emap Communications acquired AGOR SAS, the market leading independent exhibition business serving the domestic French retail sector in the volume, gifts and clearance goods markets for 21m, net of 3m cash included within the company acquired.
The division also acquired Naidex Exhibitions, a medical therapy sector exhibition, from Touchstone Exhibitions and Conferences Ltd for a cash consideration of 1m.

This transaction resulted in the Emap Consumer Media division disposing of the Red, Elle, Elle Girl and Elle Decoration titles for a cash consideration of 30m and a profit arising on disposal of 28m.
This was a settlement based on Hachette paying 50% of the agreed valuation of the titles that it would continue to publish following the dissolution.
Under the terms of the agreement the Group ceased to be entitled to recognise the turnover and attributable profit relating to Elle, Elle Girl, Elle Decoration and Red.
The Consolidated profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2003 includes turnover of 17m and operating profit of 3m relating to these titles up to and including October 2002.
Following the disposal of its operations in the USA in August 2001, the Group and Primedia Inc were in dispute regarding the calculation of post completion working capital.
This dispute was settled by a process of binding arbitration, final agreement being reached in April 2003.
This resulted in a profit arising on disposal of 13m which has been included in the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2003.
Further costs relating to the disposal of 2m were paid during the year and a final settlement of 1m cash was received from Primedia Inc in April 2003.
