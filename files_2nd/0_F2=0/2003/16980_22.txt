These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb the reversal of these tax benets.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 13,158,000 2002: 13,460,000 have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
The Group will continue to manage its future global tax charge with a view to delivering a continuing sub-standard tax rate.
No provision has been made for the liability to tax from capital gains amounting to 78,000 2002: 77,000 which would arise if land and buildings were to be sold at their book amounts.

Retirement benets The Group operates dened benefit pension arrangements in the UK and North America of which The Weir Group Pension & Retirement Savings Scheme is predominant.
The latest full actuarial assessment of this plan was at 31 December 2002 and, for the purposes of accounting for FRS17, this has been adjusted to reect the position at the 2003 year end by a qualied independent actuary.
For this closed scheme, the current service cost is expected to increase under the projected unit method as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Resulting from the latest full actuarial assessment, on the advice of the actuary, the employer contribution rate increased from 10.5% to 12.5% of total contribution salaries with effect from 1 April 2003 and a special contribution of 10m was made in the first half of 2003.
It is intended that the next full actuarial assessment of this plan for funding purposes will take place as at 31 December 2005.
