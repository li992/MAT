CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS HAVE NOT BEEN PREPARED AS EXEMPTION UNDER S229 COMPANIES ACT 1985 HAS BEEN UTILISED DUE TO THE IMMATERIALITY OF THE SUBSIDIARY.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial statements of investment trust companies SORP.
Valuation of investments Quoted investments are valued at middle market prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted investments are valued by the Board.
In making their valuations, the Board have taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors, with consideration given to the British Venture Capital Association guidelines.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to capital reserve realised, and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the capital reserve unrealised.
Income Dividends from equity shares are included in the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits and of any tax credit on overseas income.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserves unrealised.
Interest receivable on fixed interest stocks, deposit interest and interest payable is recognised in the revenue account on an accruals basis.
Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital Instruments.
Finance costs of debt insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments are allocated 50% to capital reserve realised and 50% to revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income respectively from the investment portfolio of the Company.
v. Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged wholly to the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment: and expenses are charged to capital reserve realised where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the management fee has been allocated 50% to capital reserve realised and 50% to revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve realised or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is capital or revenue in nature.
Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, using the Companys effective rate of tax for the accounting period.
Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS19 Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments including equity shares and fixed income securities with international exposure.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Bank loans, debenture stocks and interest rate swaps none open at 31st January 2003 2002: same in sterling, for which the main purpose is to raise finance for the Companys operations: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates both foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing these risks is summarised over the page.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the preceeding year to which these financial statements relate.
Fleming Mercantile 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 19.
Financial instruments continued Market Price Risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential gain or loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on at least five occasions to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to manage the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its operations through bank borrowings and retained profits.
The Company borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then can use interest rate swaps to both generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, the Companys borrowings were at fixed rates.
Foreign Currency Risk The value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments: Movements in rates affect short-term timing differences, and The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The material accounting policies adopted in accounting for financial instruments are disclosed on page 29.
With the exception of the note on currency exposures, the Company has excluded short-term debtors and creditors from the following analysis.
