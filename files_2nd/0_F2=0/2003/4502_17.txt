64 fide La Rue Annual Report 2003 23 Pensions and other post-retirement benets The Group operates pension plans throughout the world covering the majority of employees.
These plans are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the country concerned.
The assets of the Groups plans are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
A provision of 21.4m 2002 22.4m is included in provisions for liabilities and charges, to cover the excess of the accumulated pension costs 18.6m and other postretirement benets 2.8m over the amounts funded.
The total pension cost for the Group was 4.2m 2002 4.2m, of which 3.3m relates to plans in the United Kingdom and the United States which cover 72 per cent of employees within schemes.
Included within the total pension cost is 1.1m for dened contribution arrangements in the USA.
An actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2000.
The results are reected in this Annual Report.
The scheme is valued formally every three years, the next valuation being as at April 2003.
The results of this are expected later in the year.
Information on the dened benefit scheme operated in the UK is as follows: Last valuation date 6 April 2000 Main assumptions Investment return p. a.
3.75% Market valuation of investments at last valuation date 493.0m Level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of the accrued service liabilities 113% Regular pension cost 8.0m Variation from regular cost 6.1 m Net pension cost for 2003 1.9m The contributions to the UK plan are assessed in accordance with advice from Aon Consulting, independent consulting actuaries, using the Dened Accrued Benets Method.
This method aims for a stable and regular pension cost for current and expected future employees over their anticipated period of employment.
The surplus of assets over liabilities is spread over the average expected remaining service lives of current employees, assessed as 13 years, using the level percentage of salary method.
Other postretirement benets of 0.2m were utilised in the year 2002 0.4m.
These benets relate mainly to healthcare and life assurance for beneciaries in the United States.
The benets are covered by an unfunded dened benefit scheme and a provision is carried in the balance sheet for the accumulated liabilities.
These were assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice as at 31 March 1997 using the projected unit credit method.
The assumed discount rate was 7.25 per cent p. a. and annual healthcare costs were assumed to increase by 7.0 per cent p. a.
The Group continues to report pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24.
However, the Group is following the extended transitional arrangements under which additional disclosure on retirement benets is required in the notes to the financial statements under FRS 17.
The standard requires pension deficits and surpluses, to the extent that these are considered recoverable, to be recognised in full.
Annual service costs and net financial income or expense on the assets and liabilities of the schemes will be recognised through the profit and loss account.
Other uctuations in the value of the surplus will be recognised in the Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Group operates a dened benefit pension scheme in the UK.
