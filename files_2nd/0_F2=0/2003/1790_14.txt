The latest actuarial funding valuations of the Groups principal dened benefit schemes, the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, the Railways Pension Scheme and the Mansell schemes, have been updated by the actuaries to 31 December 2003 on the basis prescribed by FRS 17.
In particular, scheme liabilities have been discounted using the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond rather than the expected rate of return on the assets in the scheme used in the funding valuations.
The principal assumptions used by the actuaries were: At 31 December 2003 At 31 December 2002 At 31 December 2001 Balfour Balfour Balfour Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Pension Pension Mansell Pension Pension Pension Pension Fund Scheme schemes Fund Scheme Fund Scheme %%% %%%% Ination assumption 2.70 2.70 2.70 2.20 2.20 2.50 2.50 Rate of increase in salaries 4.20 4.20 4.20 3.70 3.70 4.00 4.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment or other such other xed rate as is guaranteed 2.70 2.70 2.70 2.20 2.20 2.50 2.50 Discount rate 5.40 5.40 5.40 5.60 5.60 5.75 5.60 The fair value of the assets held by the schemes, the expected rate of return on those assets and the present value of the scheme liabilities were: Balfour Beatty Railways Pension Fund Pension Scheme Mansell schemes Other funded schemes Long-term Long-term Long-term Long-term expected expected expected expected rate of rate of rate of rate of return at Value at return at Value at return at Value at return at Value at 31December 31December 31December 31December 31December 31December 31December 31December 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 %m % m %m % m Equities 8.50 548 8.50 197 8.50 79 Gilts 4.78 505 Other bonds 4.91 309 5.00 23 5.00 38 5.20 12 Property 8.50 3 7.00 18 Cash and other net current assets 3.70 20 3.70 1 Total market value of assets rate of return 6.27 1,385 8.10 238 7.34 118 5.20 12 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,523 264 178 12 Surplus deficit in scheme 138 26 60 Related deferred tax asset 41 8 18 Net pension assets liabilities 97 18 42 Balfour Beatty Railways Pension Fund Pension Scheme Other funded schemes Long-term Long-term Long-term expected expected expected rate of rate of rate of return at Value at return at Value at return at Value at 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 %m % m %m Equities 8.30 482 8.30 204 8.00 4 Gilts 4.39 492 Other bonds 4.63 256 4.90 12 5.31 12 Property 8.30 14 8.50 18 Cash and other net current assets 3.70 24 1 Total market value of assets rate of return 5.96 1,268 8.10 234 5.57 17 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,350 254 22 Surplus deficit in scheme 82 20 5 Related deferred tax asset 25 6 1 Net pension assets liabilities 57 14 4 Balfour Beatty plc Annual report and accounts 2003 66 23 Pensions continued Balfour Beatty Railways Pension Fund Pension Scheme Other funded schemes Long-term Long-term Long-term expected expected expected rate of rate of rate of return at Value at return at Value at return at Value at 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 %m % m %m Equities 8.00 528 8.00 263 8.00 5 Gilts 5.00 418 Other bonds 5.54 374 5.25 15 6.05 13 Property 8.00 39 7.00 17 Cash and other net current assets 4.75 13 Total market value of assets rate of return 6.39 1,372 7.80 295 6.47 18 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,340 270 21 Surplus deficit in scheme 32 25 3 Related deferred tax liability 10 7 Net pension assets liabilities 22 18 3 The analysis of the movement in the surplus deficit in the schemes is as follows: Balfour Beatty Railways Other Pension Pension Mansell funded Fund Scheme schemes schemes m m m m At 1 January 2003 82 20 5 Current service cost 32 7 Settlement gain 5 Contributions 16 1 2 Other finance income 13 Actuarial gains losses 38 8 Transfers 3 3 Acquisitions of businesses 60 At 31 December 2003 138 26 60 The actuarial gain loss in 2003 comprises: Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets amount 84m 14m percentage of scheme assets 6.1% 6.1% Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities amount 17m 1 m percentage of scheme liabilities 1.1% 0.4 % Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities amount 139 m 21 m percentage of scheme liabilities 9.1 % 8.3 % Total actuarial gain loss amount 38 m 8 m percentage of scheme liabilities 2.5 % 3.0 % In 2002 the actuarial gain loss comprised: Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets amount 139 m 40 m 2 m percentage of scheme assets 10.9 % 17.3 % 8.8 % Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities amount 17m 9 m percentage of scheme liabilities 1.3% 3.4 % Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities amount 23m 7m percentage of scheme liabilities 1.7% 2.9% Total actuarial gain loss amount 99 m 42 m 2 m percentage of scheme liabilities 7.3 % 16.5 % 11.7 % Balfour Beatty plc Annual report and accounts 2003 67 Notes to the accounts continued 23 Pensions continued The Railways Pension Scheme is a shared cost scheme.
Accordingly the surplus deficit shown above assumes that the Group will obtain economic benefit from, or be required to finance, only a proportion of the surplus or deficit in the Balfour Beatty section of the scheme.
This proportion has been based on the apportionment of the surplus deficit which has already been agreed together with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and Rules and Trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit nancing.
Contributions paid in 2003 for the principal schemes were 16m 2002: 4m for the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund and 1m 2002: nil for the Railways Pension Scheme.
In addition the Group has unfunded post retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America amounting to 17m 2002: 16m, the majority of which arrangements are closed to new entrants.
