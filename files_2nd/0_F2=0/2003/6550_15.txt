Diluted earnings per ordinary share is 67.06p 2002 50.04p.
The calculation is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average number of shares in issue plus the dilutive potential ordinary shares amounting to 8.4 million 2002 7.6 million shares.
The dilutive potential ordinary shares relate to shares allotted under employee share schemes where the fair value price exceeds the option price.
The 2002 basic earnings per share before exceptional items is calculated on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding an adjustment for operating exceptional items of 5.9 million, net of taxation, divided by the average number of shares in issue during the year of 375.3 million.
The 2002 diluted earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items is similarly adjusted.
The adjusted earnings per share excludes exceptional items as they do not relate to the profitability of the Group on an ongoing basis.
There were no exceptional items in 2003.
The calculation of shareholders funds per ordinary share is based on shareholders funds for the Group at the end of the year divided by the number of shares in issue at the end of the year of 384.1 million 2002 377.2 million.

The assets of the schemes are held in separate Trustee administered funds.
The largest, which is in the UK, is the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme the George Wimpey Scheme, and is of the funded, dened benefit type and is closed to new entrants for new employees in the UK, George Wimpey pays contributions into stakeholder pension arrangements.
The Trustees are George Wimpey Pension Trustees Limited and the Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc.
The George Wimpey Scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent actuaries, the last such valuation being carried out as at 5 April 2002, using the projected unit method.
Details of this valuation are described below.
The actuarial assumptions which have the most significant effect are those relating to return on investment, the rate of increase in salaries and the assumed rate of pension increases.
In the 5 April 2002 valuation it was assumed that the investment return prior to retirement would exceed price ination by 4.5% per annum, and post retirement by 3.5% per annum.
Salary increases were assumed to exceed price ination by 2.0% per annum.
Pension increases were assumed to be in line with price ination.
The market value of assets was 523 million, and this gure was 8% below the amount required to cover the benets that had accrued to the members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The shortfall under the SSAP 24 assumption is allocated to operating profit over the average remaining service life of current employees.
Details of the funding valuation are referred to in the Operating and Financial Review on page 27.
The group has paid contributions of 17.3 million to the George Wimpey Scheme in 2003.
This gure includes contributions made by the Group in respect of former employees of Laing Homes, who joined the George Wimpey scheme with effect from 1 November 2003.
Employee contributions for Laing Homes George Wimpey scheme members are being phased in up to 1 January 2006.
As part of the terms of their transfer these members paid reduced employee contributions equal to 1% of scheme salary for the period 1 November 2003 to 31 December 2003.
The total pension costs for the Group were 13.5 million 2002 12.4 million of which 0.8 million 2002 0.8 million related to overseas schemes.
The prepayment in the balance sheet resulting from the difference in the amounts charged to the profit and loss account and the amounts paid to the Scheme was 15.4 million 2002 9.1 million.
No significant improvements in benets were made in 2003.
Contributions in respect of non-Laing Homes employees were paid at a rate of 31.8% of scheme salary over 2003 21.2% of scheme salary from 1 November 2003 for former Laing Homes employees.
It has been agreed with the Trustees that contributions of 40% of scheme salary will be paid throughout 2004 in respect of non-Laing Homes employees subject to a minimum rate of 13.2% of scheme salary plus 15 million per annum.
In respect of former Laing Homes employees, contributions will be paid at a rate of 20.2% of scheme salary throughout 2004.
On a Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 basis, the valuation position of the George Wimpey Scheme was updated from the most recent actuarial valuation to 31 December 2003 by a qualied independent actuary.
The valuation at 31 December 2003 showed an increase in the deficit from 115 million to 130 million after the related deferred tax asset.

21 Interest Rate and Currency Hedges As explained in the Operating and Financial Review on page 26, the Groups policy is to hedge part of the interest rate risk and transactional currency exposure.
Gains and losses on interest rate and currency hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recorded.
Unrecognised and deferred gains and losses on interest and currency instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows: Unrecognised Deferred Gains Losses Net Gains Losses Net m m m m m m Gains Losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 5.0 4.7 0.3 Gains Losses arising in previous years included in 2003 income 3.1 2.8 0.3 Gains Losses arising before 31 December 2002 not included in 2003 income 1.9 1.9 Gains Losses arising in 2003 not included in 2003 income 3.5 0.5 3.0 1.5 1.5 Gains Losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 5.4 2.4 3.0 1.5 1.5 of which: Gains Losses to be recognised in 2004 4.7 2.4 2.3 1.5 1.5 Gains Losses to be recognised in 2005 or later 0.7 0.7 56 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 22 Currency Exposure and Analysis of Net Assets The Groups principal subsidiaries have little transactional currency exposure as they neither export goods nor import any material amount of products nor have any significant level of intra-group trading or provision of services.
Consequently, none of the principal subsidiaries has any material net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities by reference to their local currencies and hence the amount of foreign exchange differences included in the Group profit and loss account for 2002 and 2003 was not material.
The table below provides a currency analysis of the net assets of the Group: 2003 2002 Net Operating Net Net Net Operating Net Net Assets Borrowings Assets Assets Borrowings Assets m m m m m m Sterling 1,421.4 262.9 1,158.5 1,057.3 154.3 903.0 US $ 277.7 266.8 10.9 261.0 221.3 39.7 Other 0.1 0.5 0.6 0.3 0.3 Total Net Assets 1,699.2 529.2 1,170.0 1,318.6 375.6 943.0 23 Fair Values The fair value is dened as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, excluding accrued interest, and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
All debt and financial instruments used to manage the interest rate and currency of borrowings with a maturity of less than three months after the balance sheet date are assumed to have a fair value equal to the book value.
The book values are the amounts recorded in the balance sheet.
Financial liability provisions relate to rental guarantees as set out in note 25.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities that are hedged using currency swaps are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the book value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the fair value of the hedging instrument.
For the purpose of the table below, the book value of the relevant asset or liability is shown gross of the effect of the hedging instrument.
