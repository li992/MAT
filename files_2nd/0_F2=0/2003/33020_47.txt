Factors affecting future tax charges As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing policies and tax levels imposed.
In 2003, a settlement was negotiated with the UK and US governments covering all liabilities potentially arising from transfer pricing in respect of ex-Zeneca products for the years 1987 to 2001.
The settlement had been provided for in previous years and had no impact on the 2003 tax charge.
