Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Set out below is a summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company, its subsidiary undertakings and undertakings where the group exercises dominant influence, after eliminating the effects of intra-group transactions.
Where the group or the company owns a non-controlling interest, held for the long term, in the equity share capital of another company or the equity of a partnership and is in a position to exercise significant influence over that company or partnership, the interest is equity accounted and the company or partnership treated as an associated undertaking.
Where the group or the company owns a non-controlling interest in the equity share capital of another company and is not in a position to exercise significant influence, it is held as an investment and stated in the balance sheet at cost.
The results of subsidiary and associated undertakings acquired during the year are incorporated from the effective date of acquisition.
Turnover Turnover represents income from subscriptions, advertising, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
Subscription revenues are recognized in the profit and loss account over the period of the subscription.
Revenue invoiced but relating to future periods is deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The group uses various financial instruments to manage financial risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency movements.
These include currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts, interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
Currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are used to convert foreign currency funds into sterling to meet sterling costs.
Realized exchange gains and losses are recognized in the profit and loss account.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognized as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps, caps and collars, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are not revalued to fair value or shown in the group balance sheet at the year end as all transactions derive from hedging activities.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange of the related foreign exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Page 40 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Profit and loss accounts for overseas subsidiary undertakings are converted into sterling at the average daily rate of exchange for the year, with the year end adjustment to closing rates taken to reserves and the Statement of Total Recognized Gains and Losses.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of the net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings at closing rates are shown as a movement on reserves and in the Statement of Total Recognized Gains and Losses together with exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group investment in such overseas companies.
Changes in the sterling value of outstanding foreign currency loans which finance certain fixed assets are taken to reserves and the Statement of Total Recognized Gains and Losses together with the differences arising on the translation of the related foreign currency denominated assets.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Leased assets Where the group has entered into finance leases, the obligations to the lessor are shown as part of the borrowings and the corresponding assets are treated as fixed assets.
Leases are regarded as finance leases where their terms transfer to the lessee substantially all the benefits and burdens of ownership other than the right to legal title.
Depreciation is calculated in order to write-off the amounts capitalized over the estimated useful lives of the assets by equal annual installments.
Rentals payable under finance leases are apportioned between capital and interest, the interest portion being charged to the profit and loss account and the capital portion reducing the obligations to the lessor.
Other leases are regarded as operating leases whose rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line or other systematic rational basis as allowed by SSAP 21, 'Accounting for Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts'.
Pensions Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and past service, ex-gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments to existing pensions are based on the advice of independent actuaries.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account when amounts become payable on the accruals basis.
For the defined benefit scheme there is no material difference at present between this basis and using a basis that spreads the expected cost of providing pensions over the employees working lives with the group.
The group currently accounts for pensions under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the group is required to provide additional disclosures relating to its pension schemes as set out in note 5.
Earnings per share The earnings per share and diluted earnings per share calculations in note 10 follow the provisions of FRS 14 Earnings per Share.
The diluted earnings per share figure is calculated by adjusting for the dilution effect of the exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the company and excluding the ordinary shares held by the Euromoney Employees Share Ownership Trust.
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Page 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Depreciation Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold premises 2% Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 25% - 33% Motor vehicles 20% Goodwill The group capitalizes all goodwill arising on consolidation for those acquisitions made after October 1 1998.
Such goodwill is amortized to the profit and loss account over its estimated useful economic life on a straight line basis of normally 10 years, but up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions made prior to that date remains eliminated against the profit and loss reserve, but is reinstated and charged to the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which the goodwill relates or when goodwill is no longer separately identifiable.
Where the company has divisionalized the unincorporated businesses of its subsidiaries, the investment in the subsidiary then has the substance of goodwill and is reclassified accordingly.
Goodwill arising in these circumstances is not amortized in the company where the directors are of the view that the goodwill has an indefinite economic life, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The non-amortization of goodwill represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 but is necessary to give a true and fair view under the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure, as it would depend on the life adopted.
As at September 30 2003 and 2002, the total of such goodwill was 7,100,000.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of FRS 19 'Deferred Taxation', and is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallize based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences on un-remitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Following an updated review of FRS 19 timing differences arising on tax deductible goodwill written off to reserves is recognized.
The company believes it appropriate to discount the resultant deferred tax liabilities over an indefinite period because the businesses are expected to be held for the long term.
The discounting effect on short-term timing differences is not significant.
Reclassification The 2002 group balance sheet has been restated to reflect a reclassification of accruals.
In the group balance sheet, accruals of 17,258,000 which were included in creditors due within one year at September 30 2002 are now included in accruals and deferred income on the face of the balance sheet.
The relevant adjustment in the company balance sheet is 9,938,000.

4 Exceptional items Exceptional goodwill impairment The group regularly performs a review of its portfolio and this year the review has resulted in additional goodwill write offs in the profit and loss account.
The group has accelerated the amortization of goodwill on its recent Gulf acquisition from 20 years to 10 years and has written down other portfolio assets where goodwill was held on the balance sheet by 1,051,000.
In addition, the group has taken a writedown of 6,779,000 through the profit and loss account for goodwill that was previously written off against reserves under SSAP 22 on several investments either where the goodwill is now no longer separately identifiable as a result of business merger or where the immediate prospects for the business are uncertain.
Exceptional profit on disposal closure of businesses 2003 In January 2003, the group sold two titles owned by Asia Law and Practice for a profit of 701,000 after related sale costs.
There was no goodwill associated with the sale.
2002 In March 1999, the group sold its investment in 100% Design Limited for a cash consideration of 743,000 and a performance based deferred consideration.
During 2002, the group received the final element of the deferred consideration amounting to 1,772,000.
In the first half of 2002, the group closed its Technology Media Limited business, which resulted in a goodwill write off of 239,000.
5 Staff costs i Directors emoluments 2003 2002 000s 000s The emoluments of the directors of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC were as follows: Directors fees, management remuneration and benefits in kind 4,795 5,773 Pension contributions 432 423 5,227 6,196 Details of directors remuneration are set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 19 to 31.

Retirement Savings Plan in the US.
It also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
The pension charge for the year ended September 30 comprised: 2003 2002 000s 000s Harmsworth Pension Scheme 194 224 Euromoney Pension Plan 270 251 Private schemes 507 554 971 1,029 Harmsworth Pension Scheme The Harmsworth Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a Trustee company.
Pension costs are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary following triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
This scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
A valuation of this scheme was carried out as at March 31 2001.
The assumptions having the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are shown in the following table: Price inflation 2.5% p. a.
The contribution rate paid by employees is 5% of pensionable salaries and the companys cash contribution is 12% of pensionable salaries.
Page 46 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Notes to the Accounts continued 5 Staff costs continued The surplus identified from the last valuation of the scheme will be amortized over a period of 11 years using the straight line method.
An interim valuation of the scheme at March 31 2003, determined that the market value of the assets of the scheme was 287.8 million and the actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 102% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Although the scheme was in surplus on the normal funding basis, in anticipation of the results of the next full valuation in 2004, the company has agreed with the Trustees that its cash contribution rate should be increased from 12% to 15% of pensionable salaries from October 1 2003.
The effect of UITF 6 Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other than Pensions, is not material.
Euromoney Pension Plan The Euromoney Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
From February 1 2003 this plan was merged with the DMGT Pension Trust, an umbrella trust under which DMGT UK defined contribution plans are held.
Insured death benefits are also held under this trust.
The plan is contracted-in to the State Second Pension S2P and its assets are invested under trust with Scottish Widows in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
Overseas Pension Plans Institutional Investor Inc. contributes to a 401k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 15% of salary with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 5% of salary.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits' As permitted by the transitional arrangements of FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the financial statements continue to be reported in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the defined benefit scheme since the scheme includes members from other companies within the Daily Mail and General Trust group.
Under FRS 17 the scheme will therefore be accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
Full disclosures in relation to the scheme are given in the accounts of the DMGT group.
Stakeholder Pensions The company provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for other pension schemes operated by the group.

The current tax charge for the year is different from 30% of profit before tax for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation: 2003 2002 000s 000s Profit on ordinary activities before tax 7,396 20,646 Tax at 30% 2,219 6,194 Factors affecting tax charge credit : UK goodwill amortization 4,385 1,838 Non-taxable items and additional deductible UK items 1,629 1,836 US goodwill amortization 1,590 3,184 US state taxes 219 270 Disallowable expenditure 124 2,590 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 11 20 Lower rates of tax on overseas profits 13 149 Utilization of losses brought forward 532 Release of prior years tax provisions 6,754 Over provisions in prior years 454 68 Current tax charge credit for the year 3,298 1,611 The exceptional item in 2003 gives rise to a nominal tax charge as the element relating to capital gains is not taxable in Hong Kong.
The exceptional items in 2002 did not give rise to any tax charge or credit due to the availability of brought forward capital losses and the non-deductible nature of UK goodwill amortization on share acquisitions.
The release in 2002 of prior years' tax provisions of 6,754,000 relates to tax provisions no longer required following agreement of certain open issues with the UK Inland Revenue in relation to the group's US acquisition structure.

These comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the group which are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved, but exclude certain non-sterling borrowings which are matched by equivalent group assets or are treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
The amounts shown take into account the effect of currency swaps, forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage these exposures.
As at September 30 2003 these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US dollars Other Total 000s 000s 000s 000s Functional currency: Sterling 6,392 1,005 7,397 US dollar 680 481 1,161 Other 70 392 12 334 Total 610 6,784 1,498 8,892 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Page 57 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Treasury continued As at September 30 2002 these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US dollars Other Total 000s 000s 000s 000s Functional currency: Sterling 6,165 1,070 7,235 US dollar 167 167 Other 70 836 7 773 Total 97 7,001 1,077 8,175 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison of book values to fair values of all the groups financial assets and liabilities as at September 30 2003.

These instruments take the form of forward exchange rate contracts to sell US dollars in exchange for sterling to meet the excess of sterling costs over sterling revenues as well as dividends in the parent company.
The group also uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap and collar derivatives to minimize interest rate fluctuations.
On October 24 2003 two new interest rate swaps have been entered into amounting to US$10 million each with Daily Mail and General Holdings Limited with effective date January 15 2004.
On September 24 2003 the group entered into a tax equalization swap to hedge the cash effect of tax on unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on the companys net dollar liabilities.
This was achieved by a sale of US$22 million in exchange for sterling maturing on March 24 2004.
Due to a change in tax legislation on foreign currency gains and losses the tax equalisation swap is no longer required for hedging the effect.
During October 2003 an equal and opposite swap was taken out to neutralise the original swap.
In the previous year the group hedged this same risk by entering into a tax equalization swap to hedge the cash effect of tax on unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on the companys net dollar liabilities.
This was achieved by a sale of US$14 million in exchange for sterling maturing on March 27 2003.
On this date it was rolled over until September 24 2003.
As a result of a change in UK taxation rules this forward contract became redundant during the year and on maturity a profit of 521,000 was recognised in the profit and loss account.

The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, the level of profits in future years are more likely than not to be sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax asset of 9,700,000 has not been recognized in respect of overseas tax losses 2002: 7,800,000 as there is insufficient certainty in the current global market to be able to say that the group will be more likely than not to generate sufficient suitable overseas taxable profits.
The group is able to obtain tax relief in the US for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some businesses.
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10 'Goodwill and Intangible Assets'.
Utilization of the available tax relief in the US gives rise to a timing difference as set out above.
The potential timing difference will only reverse on a sale of the relevant businesses.
As the relevant businesses are considered core to the group there is currently no intention to sell them.
The potential reversal is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant.
The effect of discounting the group's other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.
