The differences are explained in the following reconciliation: 2003 2002 000s 000s Profit on ordinary activities before tax 51,491 46,348 Tax at 30% thereon: 15,447 13,904 Factors affecting the charge for the year: Amortisation of goodwill 1,294 1,350 Permanent items 1,861 430 Capital allowances differing from depreciation 250 472 Short term timing differences 462 918 Losses and goodwill included in deferred tax 1,814 870 Losses and goodwill not recognised in deferred tax 70 180 Adjustments in respect of previous years 11 875 Effect of overseas tax rates 127 535 Current tax charge for the year 16,030 13,934 The Group's total tax charge is currently 32.6% of profit before taxation 2002 : 31.6%.
The following factors that will affect the Group's future total tax charge are: - the mix of profits between UK and overseas companies.
With the exception of the Republic of Ireland, all overseas trading companies attract a higher corporation tax rate than that suffered in the UK of 30%.
As the level of profits from overseas companies increases, this could result in a higher Group tax charge depending upon the overseas source of such profits.
- the adverse impact of permanent disallowables including non tax deductible goodwill amortisation.
Under the rules of FRS 19 Deferred tax, the Group has already taken account of substantially all trading losses in its deferred tax balance.
Although tax losses can be used to reduce cash payments of tax, utilisation of such losses results in a deferred tax charge in that year which will eliminate any profit and loss benefit.

Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2004.
Prepaid consideration arose as a result of 0.472m being paid to the vendors of Acoustique Diffusion S. A. S. in December 2002, although the acquisition was effective from 1 January 2003.
The contingent consideration of 0.444m is payable to the vendors of four of the acquisitions set out in the note above, if certain profit targets are achieved.

The movement in the US Senior loan notes between 2002 and 2003 reflects the movements in Euro and Sterling exchange rates during the year.
In accordance with SSAP 20 Foreign currency translation, the exchange loss of 5.235m has been taken to the exchange reserve to offset exchange gains on retranslation of Euro denominated overseas net assets.
15 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Finance Directors Review on pages 18 and 19 provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary undertakings are excluded from the scope of these disclosures, as are short-term debtors and creditors, other than the currency disclosures.
Interest rate profile The Group has no financial assets other than cash at bank, including cash deposits of 55.417m 2002 : 13.558m which are part of the financing arrangements of the Group.
After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, the interest rate and currency profiles of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 were as follows: Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Total rate rate Total rate rate 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Sterling 27,416 27,416 51,768 19,777 31,991 Euro 97,263 4,063 93,200 76,458 6,321 70,137 US Dollar 7,053 1,054 5,999 8,712 8,712 Total 131,732 5,117 126,615 136,938 34,810 102,12 48 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 15 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued The fixed rates are fixed for a period of between one and fourteen years.
The interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to UK base rate in the case of Sterling liabilities, LIBOR for Euro liabilities, US prime rate and LIBOR for US Dollar liabilities.
24.149m 2002 : 24.149m of the Sterling and 69.823m 2002 : 64.588 of the Euro fixed rate liabilities relate to the unsecured US Senior loan notes repayable in 2008 and 2011 and attract an average interest rate of 6.851% 2002 : 6.851%.
3.267m 2002 : 7.842m of the Sterling and 1.345m 2002 : 1.750m of the Euro fixed rate liabilities are lease contracts taken out over a maximum period of five years with an average interest rate of 5% 2002 : 5%.
The remaining Euro fixed rate liabilities of 22.032m 2002 : 3.799m have a weighted average interest rate of 2.7% 2002 : 6.3% and are repayable over a weighted average period of less than one year 2002 : two years.
The US Dollar fixed rate liability attracts an interest rate of 1.63% and is repayable within one year.
Currency exposures The Groups objective in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures is to maintain medium term borrowings to minimise currency exposures on foreign currency assets.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings after taking into account currency swaps set out on page 48 represent a hedge against the Groups overseas net investments, and therefore exchange gains and losses arising are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and not in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.
Transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account are minimal as Group companies do not enter into significant amounts of cross border transactions.
The gain arising in the Group during 2003 in respect of transactional exposures amounted to 171,000 2002 : 24,000.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 was as follows: Borrowings 2003 2002 000s 000s In one year or less 34,218 31,863 In more than one year but not more than two years 2,665 4,102 In more than two years but not more than five years 34,556 10,487 In more than five years 60,293 90,486 Total 131,732 136,938 Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2003 as follows: Borrowings 2003 2002 000s 000s Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 21,937 25,000 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 676 10,589 Total 22,613 35,589 Fair Values The estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2003 was: 2003 2002 Book Value Fair Value Book Value Fair Value 000s 000s 000s 000s US Senior loan notes 93,972 68,128 88,737 75,186 US Senior loan note swaps 28,640 12,569 Cash overdraft 51,356 51,356 5,040 5,040 Bank Loans 29,085 29,085 20,011 20,011 Total 71,701 74,497 113,788 112,806 The fair values of overdraft and bank loans are not considered materially different to their book values.

Onerous leasehold property contracts The Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts where a period of vacancy is ongoing.
The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub lease agreements on a contract by contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments as disclosed in note 22.
Leasehold dilapidation commitments Transferred from accruals and deferred income into other provisions are property dilapidation provisions.
These provisions relate to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties into their original state of repair upon exit of the lease.
The provisions are calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in note 22.

Guarantees The Company has cross guaranteed overdrafts of subsidiary undertakings amounting to 8.011m 2002 : 12.133m.
d. Pension scheme The Group operates a number of pension schemes, four 2002 : four of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary, the assets of which are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes all of which are independently managed.
The defined benefit schemes are herein after referred to as the main scheme and other schemes, being three smaller schemes.
The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits for its defined benefit pension schemes for the first time in 2003.
The full impact of this change in accounting policy has been disclosed in note 23.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations The valuations of the UK defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The main actuarial assumptions in the pension assessments were that over the long term the annual investment return would be 2.5% higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries, and 1% higher than the annual increase in pensions.
The last formal actuarial valuations of two of the defined benefit schemes including the main scheme were conducted at 1 January 2001, and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 24.6m and 2.1m and their actuarial values covered 83% and 117% respectively of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the third defined benefit scheme was at 30 June 2001 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 9.47m and its actuarial value covered 117% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the fourth defined benefit scheme was at 6 April 2001 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1.507m and its actuarial value covered 87% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for future expected increases in pensionable salaries.
As at 31 December 2003, actuarial valuations are currently being performed on three out of the four defined benefit schemes, including the main scheme.
54 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 22 Guarantees and other financial commitments continued d. Pension scheme continued Profit and Loss Account charges The pension charge for the year relating to the main scheme was 1.458m 2002 : 1.401m, 0.370m 2002 : 0.063m in relation to other schemes and 2.453m 2002 : 2.726m in relation to defined contribution schemes.
In accordance with FRS 17 Retirement benefits, the charge for the main scheme has been calculated on the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on net assets.
The Group contribution to the main scheme during the year amounted to 20.7% of pensionable salaries.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2003 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, have an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
Balance Sheet liability The net balance sheet liability position in respect of the four defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2003 2003 2002 2002 000s 000s 000s 000s Deficit in the main scheme 15,445 15,586 Related deferred tax asset 4,633 4,676 Net pension liability of the main scheme 10,812 10,910 Deficit in the other schemes 4,127 4,634 Related deferred tax asset 1,238 1,390 Net pension liability of the other schemes 2,889 3,244 Total pension liability 13,701 14,154 The net actuarial gain adjusted for deferred tax for the year recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses amounted to 234,000 2002 : loss of 9,208,000.
