The following detailed disclosures with regard to the use of financial instruments and derivatives exclude short term trade debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS13.
1 Foreign Currency Risk The Group hedges transactions primarily related to the purchase and sale of inventories denominated in foreign currencies through foreign exchange forward contracts.
These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements with respect to these transactions and cash ows.
Gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying transactions.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cashow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movements in exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specically hedge all of its long-term investments in overseas assets.
This has resulted in currency translation losses, amounting to 0.3 million and 1.3 million in the years ended 2nd February 2003 and 3rd February 2002, respectively, being charged to reserves in relation to the translation of overseas assets.
At 2nd February 2003 the gross notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts, all of which had maturities of less than one year, totalled 14.0 million 2002: 2.9 million and can be analysed as follows: Commitments to sell foreign currency Sterling equivalent Unrecognised deferred gains and losses 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Euros 11.6 0.1 Australian dollars 2.4 2.9 Other currencies 14.0 2.9 0.1 The increase in the gross notional amount of forward foreign exchange contracts compared to last year end reects variations in the timing of entering into contracts.
The unrecognised deferred gains and losses in respect of foreign exchange forward contracts are estimated by reference to the amounts that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the contracts based on year end rates.
During the financial year, the Group has not used any other financial instruments to hedge trading foreign exchange rate exposures.
The Groups primary translation exposure relates to the relative values of the pound sterling and US dollar.
Although the US business generates significant US dollar trading cash ows, the Groups borrowings are predominantly US dollar denominated.
Following the conversion of a significant proportion of the Groups US dollar denominated preference shares into ordinary shares during the year, the US dollar dividend obligations are substantially reduced.
However, management anticipates that the ongoing US dollar interest obligations and US dollar trade payments in the UK will continue to preclude the need to enter into any significant hedging of US dollar cash ows.
At 2nd February 2003 the Group had the equivalent of 3.6 million 2002: 4.9 million of predominantly Euro denominated net financial assets in non-functional currencies in relation to which future movements in foreign currencies could have a limited impact on consolidated profit.
Premier Farnell plc Notes to the Accounts Annual Report and Accounts 2003 continued 61 Note 15 continued 2 Interest Rate Risk The Group nances its operations through a combination of retained cash ow, equity and non-equity shares and bank borrowings.
Procedures are in place to monitor and manage interest rate risk with derivatives being entered into when considered appropriate by management.
Financial liabilities The maturity prole of the Groups borrowings is as follows: 2003 2002 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m Due within one year 94.6 2.7 97.3 23.0 23.0 Due between one and two years 0.2 0.2 109.9 109.9 Due between two and five years 94.8 44.0 138.8 109.9 17.0 126.9 Due over five years 1.5 1.0 2.5 4.7 4.7 191.1 47.7 238.8 219.8 44.7 264.5 The Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars with the exception of the oating rate debt due within five years of 46.7 million which is denominated in sterling.
The Group has multi currency bilateral bank facilities of 125 million, which are committed until 2006.
The facilities carry a LIBOR based oating rate of interest.
At the year end, 44 million was drawn on these facilities 2002: 37 million.
The weighted average interest rate attributable to xed rate borrowings was 7.1% 2002: 7.1% and the weighted average duration of xed rate borrowings was 2.9 years 2002: 3.9 years.
Since the year end, the Group has raised $225 million 137 million of new funding in the private placement market, principally in order to renance the 7.0% Senior Notes repayable in June 2003.
These comprise $66 million of 7 year private placement notes and $159 million of 10 year private placement notes at xed interest rates of 5.3% and 5.9%, respectively.
Non-equity shares A proportion of the Groups share capital is attributable to non-equity interests, in the form of cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the preference shares are described in note 19 to the accounts.
Financial assets Cash at bank and in hand of 29.6 million 2002: 28.1 million relates principally to overnight deposits and current account balances in various currencies held in trading operations worldwide.
All significant balances earn interest based on local market rates appropriate for the currency concerned.

4 Credit Risk The Group monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its forward exchange contracts and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties.
The Group would not realise a material loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
At 2nd February 2003, neither the Group nor the counterparties were required to collateralise their respective obligations under these financial instruments.

The rights and restrictions attaching to the US$1.35 cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of 1 each the US preference shares and, following a changeover, 89.2p cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of 1 each the sterling preference shares and, together with the US preference shares, the preference shares are as follows: 1 Currency Holders of preference shares are entitled to receive a preferential dividend, a distribution on a winding up and a payment on redemption.
Holders of US preference shares receive such payments in US dollars.
Holders of sterling preference shares receive such payments in sterling.
2 Changeover A holder of US preference shares may serve notice on the Company requiring that some or all of his US preference shares be changed to sterling preference shares.
3 Income a Each holder has a right to receive a xed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of US$1.35 per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and at the rate of 89.2p per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares.
Dividends on the US and sterling preference shares are payable half-yearly in arrears in equal amounts, on 26th January and 26th July.
b The xed cumulative preferential dividends payable in respect of the US preference shares and sterling preference shares are paid in priority to any dividend payable to the holders of ordinary shares and in priority to or pari passu with the holders of any other class of preference shares in the capital of the Company.
c If a holder of US preference shares has elected to changeover his US preference shares to sterling preference shares then the xed cumulative preferential dividend and any arrears payable after the changeover date will be paid at the sterling rate set out above.
4 Conversion a Each holder of US preference shares and sterling preference shares is entitled to convert all or any of his fully paid preference shares into fully paid ordinary shares at the rate of 10.3432p in nominal amount of ordinary share capital for every 1 in nominal amount of preference share capital so converted the conversion rate.
Premier Farnell plc Notes to the Accounts Annual Report and Accounts 2003 continued 65 Note 19 continued b The preference shares may be converted on any date at the option of the holder on and from the date of issue up to and including 22nd April 2016. c If at any time 75 per cent or more of all the preference shares have been converted into ordinary shares but assuming, for this purpose only, that any preference shares which have been converted into ordinary shares pursuant to the special conversion right referred to above had never been issued or converted, the Company may give written notice to the remaining holders of US preference shares and sterling preference shares to convert the remaining US preference shares and sterling preference shares into ordinary shares.
d The conversion rate may be subject to adjustment if, inter alia, the Company makes an issue of ordinary shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, a rights issue or another offer to ordinary shareholders or if there is a change of control in the Company following a take-over offer or if a capital distribution is made.
5 Redemption The Company shall subject to any statutory restrictions on 29th April 2016 redeem all the US preference shares in issue at US$25 for every 1 of nominal value and all the sterling preference shares in issue at 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value.
6 Voting Each preference share entitles the holder to receive notice of but not to attend or vote at general meetings of the Company save in limited circumstances.
Subject to being entitled to vote on any resolution, each holder of preference shares has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll every such holder has one vote for every ordinary share to which he would be entitled on conversion of his preference shares.
7 Winding Up Subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and conditions, on a return of capital on a winding-up of the Company the assets available for distribution will be applied, first, in paying to each holder of a preference share any arrears and accruals of the preferential dividend: second, in repaying US$25 for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares: third, in repaying the capital paid up on each ordinary share: and fourth, in distributing the remainder rateably among the members of the Company according to the amounts paid up on their respective holdings of shares in the Company, each preference share being treated for this purpose as if converted at the conversion rate applicable into fully paid ordinary shares immediately prior to the commencement of the winding-up.
20 Share Options During the year options were exercised on 333,125 5p ordinary shares at 192p and on 22,500 5p ordinary shares at 193p, under the terms of the 1984 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme as subsequently amended.

These plans are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include dened contribution and dened benefit schemes.
The assets of the plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
The contributions to the plans are assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice principally using the projected unit method of valuation.
The Groups two principal plans operate in the UK and the US.
Further disclosures of these plans are set out below: UK Plan US Plan 6th April 31st October Last valuation date 1999 2002 m m Market value of investments at last valuation date 55.7 112.6 Regular pension cost 2.2 Interest on prepaid asset 6.9 Amortisation of variation 0.1 2.2 Total pension cost credit 0.1 6.9 Level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of the accrued service liabilities 104% 279% The principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the UK Plan were an average projected investment return of 8.5% per annum, salary ination of 6.0% per annum and pension increases of 3.5% per annum.
For the US Plan, the principal actuarial assumptions were an average projected investment return of 8.5% per annum and salary ination of 5.0% per annum.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the remaining service lives of current employees in the plans.
The final salary section of the UK Plan was closed to new entrants in 1998 as a result of which, under the projected unit method, the current service cost of the scheme will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Members at that date now receive benets funded through a combination of the US Plan and the UK Plan, including contributions to the money purchase section within the UK Plan.
Employees joining the UK Plan since 1 January 1999 are entitled to money purchase benets only.
An asset of 82.2 million 2002: 87.0 million is included in debtors, representing the excess of the actuarial value of the assets over the accrued service liabilities of the US Plan.
The April 2002 actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is in the process of being nalised.
This is expected to show a funding level of 94% as a result of the fall in equity market values.
As a consequence, the total pension cost for the UK Plan, under SSAP 24, for the year ending 1st February 2004, will be 0.8 million.

Premier Farnell plc Notes to the Accounts Annual Report and Accounts 2003 continued 71 29 Summary of Differences Between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP The Group accounts are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
A description of the relevant accounting principles which differ materially is given below.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Under UK GAAP, prior to the introduction of FRS10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in 1998 which requires goodwill and intangible assets to be capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, goodwill arising on acquisitions was permitted to be written off against retained earnings.
Since the introduction of FRS10, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life which, in the case of Buck & Hickman, is 20 years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full year after an acquisition and in other years if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Under US GAAP, prior to the introduction of FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and other identiable intangible assets were capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Accordingly, on the acquisition of Premier in 1996, 596 million of the excess purchase consideration over net asset value was recorded as a customer list intangible asset with the remaining 1,193 million recorded as goodwill.
The customer list was being amortised over 20 years, and goodwill amortised over 40 years.
On the acquisition of Buck and Hickman in July 2001, 21.3 million of the excess purchase consideration over net asset value was recorded as a definite lived customer list intangible asset, 8.2 million recognised as an indefinite lived intangible asset, with the remaining 23.1 million recognised as goodwill.
The Company adopted FAS 142 in full on 4 February 2002.
FAS 142 requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortised, but instead assessed annually for impairment.
definite lived intangible assets continue to be amortised over their estimated useful lives.
FAS 142 requires intangible assets to be reassessed as either definite lived or indefinite lived intangible assets on the date of adoption of the standard.
Accordingly, the Company continued to recognise the Premier customer list as a definite lived intangible asset with no change in the estimated useful life.
Similarly, the customer list intangible asset and the trademark intangible asset recognised on the acquisition of Buck and Hickman continued to be recognised as definite lived and indefinite lived intangible assets, respectively, with no change in the estimated useful life of the customer list.
The impact of adopting FAS 142 has been to cease goodwill amortisation of approximately 31 million per annum, resulting in a goodwill balance subject to impairment testing of 1,112.9 million as of 4 February 2002.
The Company performed its transitional goodwill impairment test as required by the standard as of 4 February 2002, being the adoption date, and on 31 July 2002, being the date the Company has elected for each subsequent annual impairment test.
The result of the transitional impairment test was the recognition of goodwill impairment of 728.0 million, which in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard, has been recorded as a cumulative effect change in accounting principle.
The indefinite lived trademark intangible asset was tested for impairment in accordance with the standard although no impairment was indicated.
The differing treatment of goodwill under US GAAP may also give rise to a different profit or loss being recorded in the income statement on the subsequent disposal of a business.
Deferred Taxation Under FRS 19, Deferred Tax, accounting for deferred tax under UK GAAP is now largely consistent with US GAAP.
The principal difference recognised in the reconciliation below relates to deferred tax liabilities provided against intangible assets recorded under US GAAP on acquisition which are not separately identiable under UK GAAP and for which no deferred tax liability is recorded.
Interest Rate Hedging Instruments Under UK GAAP amounts payable or receivable under an interest rate hedging swap, which incorporates an embedded written option, are accounted for over the life of the swap on an accruals basis: whereas, under US GAAP, the written option element is accounted for separately from the host contract on the balance sheet at a mark to market valuation, with changes in this valuation taken to the profit and loss account as they arise.
Pension Costs The key differences between UK GAAP SSAP24 and US GAAP in relation to dened benefit pension plans are: Under UK GAAP plan assets are valued using a discounted income valuation.
US GAAP requires plan assets to be measured at market-related value.
Under UK GAAP the effect of variations in cost can be accumulated at successive valuations and amortised on an aggregate basis.
Under US GAAP the amortisation of the transitional asset and the costs of past service benefit improvements are separately tracked, with aggregated gains and losses amortised only if outside a 10% corridor.
Under US GAAP, an additional liability is required to be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets.
An intangible asset is recognised when the additional liability is recorded and is adjusted as the additional liability changes.
However, the recorded intangible asset is limited to the amount of unrecognised prior service cost including any unrecognised net obligation from transition : any excess of the additional liability over this amount is recorded within the statement of other comprehensive income.
At 2nd February 2003, the cumulative amount of additional liability, recorded within the statement of other comprehensive income, as there was no unrecognised prior service cost was 15.4 million.
Capitalisation of interest Under UK GAAP, the Group does not capitalise interest: whereas, under US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred on capital projects which are prepared for use over time is included in xed assets and depreciated over the lives of the related assets.
Stock based compensation Under UK GAAP, a compensation cost must be calculated in respect of share options and long term incentive plans based on the difference between the share price at the date of the grant and the option award price which is recognised over the vesting period: whereas, under US GAAP, the compensation cost is based on the fair value of the option award at the date of grant and is also recognised over the vesting period.
Premier Farnell plc Notes to the Accounts Annual Report and Accounts 2003 continued 72 Note 29 continued Under UK GAAP, own shares are carried on the balance sheet and classied as a xed asset: whereas, under US GAAP, own shares are offset against shareholders funds.
Under UK GAAP, a provision is made for the cost of acquiring further shares on the market where there is an obligation under a long term incentive plan: whereas, under US GAAP, no such provision is recognised.
Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares and Preference Dividends Under UK GAAP, cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares are included as shareholders funds: whereas, under US GAAP, cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares do not form part of shareholders funds when the terms of redemption of such shares are outside the control of the Company: the dividend thereon is recorded as a charge against net income.
Under UK GAAP, the special conversion right, which enabled preference shareholders to convert their preference shares into ordinary shares at an enhanced rate of conversion, does not affect the income statement or shareholders funds, with the difference in the nominal value between the preference shares converted and ordinary shares issued being credited to the share premium account.
Under US GAAP, FAS 84, Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt, requires an expense to be recorded against net income, measured as being the difference between the fair value of ordinary shares issued pursuant to the special conversion right and the fair value of ordinary shares issued pursuant to the original conversion terms.
Under UK GAAP, costs relating to the preference share conversion are charged against share premium: whereas, under US GAAP, such costs are charged in arriving at net income.
Under UK GAAP, the cost of repurchasing preference shares is treated as a movement in the profit and loss reserve.
On cancellation of the shares a non-distributable reserve is created equivalent to the nominal value of the shares cancelled.
Under US GAAP, as the cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares are considered to closely resemble debt, the transaction is considered to be an early extinguishment of debt and the difference between the cost of repurchasing the shares and the book value of the debt is recorded as a gain.
Foreign Exchange Hedging Transactions Under UK GAAP, gains or losses arising on foreign exchange forward contracts taken out in respect of anticipated trading receipts from overseas subsidiaries may be deferred and recognised at the time of the trading receipt: whereas, under US GAAP, such gains or losses may only be deferred when designated and documented as a qualifying hedging relationship in accordance with FAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
The Company does not designate these derivative financial instruments as qualifying hedging relationships, therefore, these instruments are recorded at their fair values with gains and losses recorded currently in earnings.
The effect on net income of this difference is, however, not considered significant.
Ordinary Dividends Under UK GAAP, provision is made for dividends in the year in respect of which they are proposed by the Directors: whereas, under US GAAP, provision for dividends is not made until they are formally declared by the Directors.
