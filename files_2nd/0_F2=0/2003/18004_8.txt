Statement of the Directors :51 Responsibilities in Respect of the Financial Statements The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as at the end of the financial year and of the results of the group for the year then ended.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that each company in the group keeps proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of each company and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
