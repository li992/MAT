For interest rate derivatives, the instrument must be related to assets or liabilities or a probable commitment, such as a future bond issue, and must also change the interest rate or the nature of the interest rate by converting a xed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.

20-F 2003 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting for the reorganisation and demerger, changes in accounting policy and presentation and discontinued activities a Reorganisation and demerger On 19 November 2001, the legal separation of the mmO business from the rest of the former British 2 Telecommunications plc group was completed and BT Group plc BT Group became the ultimate parent company of British Telecommunications plc BT.
The legal structure of the transaction was such that BT transferred the mmO business to mmO plc and BT Group Investments Limited BTGI became the immediate 2 2 parent company of BT on 16 November 2001.
On 19 November 2001, mmO plc transferred the shares in BTGI 2 to BT Group, as consideration for the issue to former BT shareholders of one ordinary share of 115 pence in the company, credited as fully paid, for each ordinary share in BT held on 16 November 2001.
On 21 November 2001, following the approval of the Court, the nominal value of BT Group shares was reduced from 115 pence per ordinary share to 5 pence per ordinary share by way of a reduction of capital under section 135 of the Companies Act 1985.
The surplus of 9,537 million arising from this capital reduction has been credited to the group profit and loss reserve.
The transfer of BTGI to the company has been accounted for as a group reconstruction in accordance with the principles of merger accounting set out in Financial Reporting Standard 6 FRS 6 and Schedule 4A to the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements are therefore presented as if the company had been the parent company of the group throughout the year ended 31 March 2001 and up to the date of the demerger.
The results of mmO have been included in discontinued activities in all three years.
2 The transfer of BT to BTGI on 16 November 2001 was a group reorganisation effected for non-equity consideration.
This transaction has been accounted for in these financial statements using the principles of merger accounting as if BT had been owned and controlled by BTGI throughout the year ended 31 March 2001 and up to 16 November 2001.
This is not in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 since the group reorganisation does not meet all the conditions for merger accounting.
If acquisition accounting had been applied to account for the reorganisation whereby BTGI became the parent company of BT, this would have resulted in all the separable assets and liabilities of the BT Group as at 16 November 2001 being recorded at their fair values, substantial goodwill and goodwill amortisation charges arising and only the post demerger results being reected within the BT Group consolidated financial statements.
The directors consider that to have applied acquisition accounting in preparing these financial statements would have failed to give a true and fair view of the groups state of affairs and results.
This is because, in substance, BT Group is the successor to BT and its shareholders have had a continuing interest in the BT business both before and after the demerger.
The directors consider that it is not practicable to quantify the effects of this departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
In the companys financial statements, its investment in BTGI is stated at the nominal value of shares issued.
In accordance with sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the ordinary shares issued see note 37.
On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued and the aggregate share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve of BT at the date of the demerger the merger difference, has been debited to the other reserves see note 28. b Changes in accounting policy and presentation During the year ended 31 March 2003, the group has made a number of changes in the presentation of its financial statements.
Comparative gures have been restated accordingly.
These are explained in the notes where material.
There have been no changes to accounting policies in the 2003 financial year.
c Discontinued activities On 1 June 2001, BT disposed of its interests in Japan Telecom and J-Phone Communications and, on 29 June 2001, its interest in Airtel.
On 22 June 2001, BT sold Yell, its classied advertising directory businesses in the UK and the USA.
These activities, together with mmO, are shown as discontinued operations in the profit and loss 2 accounts.
The eliminations are intra-group eliminations.
The interest charge allocated to mmO for all periods 2 presented up to the date of the demerger has been calculated assuming that mmO s net debt at the date of 2 the demerger of 500 million, had been in existence for the whole of the period, and had been bearing an interest charge of 8% per annum.
The interest charge allocated to Yell for all periods presented up to the date of disposal represents amounts payable on intercompany loans charged at an arms length rate of interest.
The taxation charge allocated to discontinued activities, for all periods presented up to the date of demerger or disposal, represents amounts charged to these entities before recognising credit for group relief surrendered to entities within continuing activities.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 85 Notes to the financial statements 2.
Segmental analysis The group provides telecommunication services, principally in the UK and essentially operates as a unitary business.

At 31 March 2003, other than disclosed below there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O UK Limited prior to its 2 demerger with mmO on 19 November 2001, amounting to US$96 million 61 million as at 31 March 2003.
2 mmO plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
2 The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS auction.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
The first hearing has been scheduled for 11 July 2003, in Rome.
If the proceedings are successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 111 Notes to the financial statements 31.
Pension costs Background The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
In addition, disclosures have been presented in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
The group offers retirement plans to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
The BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme.
Under this dened contribution scheme the profit and loss charge represents the contribution paid by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension costs of the group including discontinued activities expensed within staff costs in the year was 322 million 2002 382 million, 2001 326 million, of which 314 million 2002 373 million, 2001 315 million related to the groups main dened benefit pension scheme, the BTPS.
The decline in the pension cost reects the reduction in the number of active members of the BTPS and the interest credit relating to the balance sheet prepayment.
This total pension cost includes the cost of providing enhanced pension benets to leavers, which amounted to 60 million 2002 46 million, 2001 nil.
In the year ended 31 March 2002 this profit and loss charge of 46 million was not the full cash cost of 186 million because there was a pension fund accounting surplus, including the provision on the balance sheet of 140 million that was fully utilised before making a charge to the profit and loss account.
The pension cost applicable to dened contribution schemes in the year ended 31 March 2003 was 4 million, 2002 5 million, 2001 nil, and 0.4 million 2002 0.3 million, 2001 nil of contributions to the schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2003.
The group occupies seven properties owned by the scheme on which an annual rental of 3 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2003, the UK equities included 37 million 2002 55 million, 2001 51 million ordinary shares of the company with a market value of 58 million 2002 154 million, 2001 258 million.
BT Pension Scheme Funding valuation A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2002 forms the basis of determining the groups pension fund contributions for the year ending 31 March 2004 and future periods until the next valuation is completed.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December because this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2002 1999 1996 2002 1999 1996 valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation % % % % % % Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 2.38 3.80 7.13 5.45 7.95 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 1.00 0.75 3.53 4.03 4.78 Return on future investments 4.00 4.00 4.25 6.60 7.12 8.42 Average increase in retail price index 2.50 3.00 4.00 Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.50 1.75 1.75 4.04 4.80 5.82 Average increase in pensions 2.50 3.00 3.75-4.00 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
112 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Notes to the financial statements 31.
Pension costs continued The mortality assumption reects improvements in life expectancy since the 1999 valuation and incorporates further future improvements.
The assumed rate of investment return, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the funding valuation.
A 0.25 percentage point change in these assumptions would have the following effects on the funding deficit: Impact on funding deficit Increase Decrease bn bn 0.25 percentage point change in: Investment return 0.9 0.9 Wage and salary increases 0.2 0.2 An additional year of life expectancy would result in a 0.7 billion increase in the deficit.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 22.8 billion 1999 29.7 billion and were sufficient to cover 91.6% 1999 96.8% of the benets accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension benets for employees leaving under release schemes since that date.
This represents a funding deficit of 2.1 billion compared to 1.0 billion at 31 December 1999.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuarys view of the median estimate basis, the funding deficit would have been reduced to 0.4 billion.
Although the current market value of equity investments has fallen, the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid by 0.3 billion in the year ended 31 December 2002.
As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group has agreed to make employers contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2003 and annual deficiency payments of 232 million.
This compares to the employers contribution rate of 11.6% and annual deficiency payments of 200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, the group made regular contributions of 278 million 2002 303 million, 2001 308 million and additional special contributions for enhanced pension benets to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2001 of 129 million in the 2003 financial year 2002 400 million, 2001 100 million and deficiency contributions of 200 million 2002 200 million, 2001 200 million.
The group will also pay a special contribution in December 2003, which is expected to amount to approximately 100 million in respect of early leavers in the year ended 31 December 2002 which has already been reected in the profit and loss account.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of 15 years.
The group will continue to make annual deficiency payments until the deficit is made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.
SSAP 24 accounting valuation The SSAP 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis: & scheme assets are valued at market value: and & scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
For the purpose of determining the groups pension expenses under SSAP 24 in the years ended 31 March 2003, 2002 and 2001, the same assumptions were used as set out above for the December 1999 funding valuation, with the exception that, over the long term, it has been assumed that the return on the existing assets of the scheme, relative to market values, would be a nominal 5.6% per annum allowing for real equity dividend growth of 1.25% per annum.
This equates to a real return of 2.5% per annum rather than the more conservative funding valuation, which used a real return of 2.4% per annum.
At 31 March 2000 there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 0.2 billion and the regular cost for the 2003, 2002 and 2001 financial years was 11.6% of pensionable salaries based on the 31 March 2000 SSAP 24 valuation.
The pension cost for the 2004 financial year will be based upon the 31 March 2003 SSAP 24 valuation.
At 31 March 2003 there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 1.4 billion, before taking account of the balance sheet prepayment and the regular cost will be 11.3% of pensionable salaries.
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003 is based on the 31 December 2002 funding valuation rolled forward, and uses the same assumptions as set out above, with the following exceptions: & return on existing assets is assumed to be a nominal 7.1% per annum, which equates to a real return of 4.7%: & average increase in retail price index is assumed to be 2.25% per annum: and & the average future increases in wages and salaries is assumed to include a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first three years, before returning to 1.5%.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 113 Notes to the financial statements 31.
Pension costs continued The cumulative difference since the adoption of SSAP 24 between the cash contributions paid by the group to the pension scheme and the profit and loss charge is reected on the balance sheet.
The cumulative cash contributions exceed the profit and loss charge and the resulting difference is shown as a prepayment on the balance sheet.
At 31 March 2003 the prepayment was 630 million 2002 231 million with the increase being principally due to the additional special and deficiency contributions in the year.
The pension charge to the profit and loss account will also include the amortisation of the combined pension fund position and pension prepayment over the average remaining service lives of scheme members, which amounts to 13 years, and the cost of enhanced pension benets provided to leavers.
FRS 17 Retirement benets The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
The requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 remain in force between its issue and full implementation, and the required information is set out below.
FRS 17 species how key assumptions should be derived and applied.
These assumptions are often different to the assumptions adopted by the pension scheme actuary and trustees in determining the funding position of pension schemes.
The accounting requirements under FRS 17 are broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the balance sheet date: & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and & movement in the scheme surplus deficit is split between operating charges and nancing items in the profit and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the BTPS liabilities under FRS 17 at 31 March 2003 are: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2003 2002 2003 2002 % % % % Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.50 1.50 3.78 4.04 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.25 2.50 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 3.08 3.41 5.40 6.00 Ination average increase in retail price index 2.25 2.50 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first three years.
The expected nominal rate of return and fair values of the assets of the BTPS at 31 March were: 31 March 2003 31 March 2002 Expected long-term Expected long-term rate of return rate of return per annum Asset fair value per annum Asset fair value % bn % % bn % UK equities 8.2 7.4 34 8.0 11.1 41 Non-UK equities 8.2 6.4 30 8.0 8.1 30 Fixed-interest securities 5.2 3.1 14 5.6 3.0 11 Index-linked securities 4.3 1.7 8 4.8 1.9 7 Property 7.0 3.3 15 7.0 2.8 10 Cash and other 4.0 0.4 1 4.5 0.2 1 Total 7.4 21.5 100 7.4 27.1 100 114 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Notes to the financial statements 31.
Pension costs continued The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the deficit but does affect the level of the expected return on assets within the net finance cost charged to the profit and loss account under FRS 17.
The net pension deficit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard was fully applied.
The fair value of the BTPS assets, the present value of the BTPS liabilities based on the financial assumptions set out above, and the resulting deficit, together with those of unfunded pension liabilities at 31 March 2003 are shown below.
The fair value of the BTPS assets is not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before it is realised.
The present value of the liabilities is derived from long-term cash ow projections and is thus inherently uncertain.

Employee share schemes The company has a share ownership scheme used for employee share allocations profit sharing, an employee share investment plan, savings-related share option schemes for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option schemes for selected group employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.
It also has several share plans for executives.
Share option schemes The major share option scheme, the BT Group Employee Sharesave Scheme, is savings related and the share options are normally exercisable on completion of a three or five year Save As You Earn contract.
A similar savings related scheme exists for group employees based outside the UK.
Following the scheme of arrangement and demerger in November 2001, all options under the savings related schemes became exercisable for a period of six months.
On expiry of this period, these options lapsed to the extent to which they had not been exercised.
Shortly before the scheme of arrangement, 57 million shares were allotted to a special purpose trust to satisfy options which were likely to be exercised during that six month period.
Participants in the BT Share Option Scheme, the BT US Stock Option Plan, the BT Worldwide Share Option Scheme, and the BT Global Share Option Plan the Executive Option Plans were given the opportunity to i conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court, release their options over British Telecommunications plc shares in consideration for the grant of options in their employers new holding company BT Group plc or mmO plc : or ii if their options were already exercisable, exercise their options over ordinary 2 shares irrespective of whether the scheme of arrangement was sanctioned by the Court: or iii if their options were not already exercisable, conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court, exercise their options immediately following that time but prior to the reduction of BT Groups share capital.
To the extent that they had not already been exercised, these options lapsed on 16 November 2001, the effective date of the scheme of arrangement.
On 17 December 2001, replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were granted under the BT Group Legacy Option Plan to all participants in the Executive Option Plans who had released their options over British Telecommunications plc shares.
The value of the replacement options was determined by averaging the combined prices of BT Group plc and mmO plc shares over the 20 dealing days following the demerger 2 on 19 November 2001.
This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former option over British Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option.
The option prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under option.

On the demerger, BTs share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave schemes and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2003 has been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected life extending one month later than the first exercise date: estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5% 2002 5%, 2001 2% : risk free interest rates of approximately 5% 2002 6%, 2001 7% : and expected volatility of approximately 40% 2002 34%, 2001 41%.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2003 was 55p 2002 55p, 2001 329p for options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 72p 2002 55p, 2001 424p for options exercisable five years after the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under the BT Group Global Share Option Plan has been estimated as 24p.
The total value of share options granted by BT in the year ended 31 March 2003 was 41 million 2002 88 million, 2001 168 million.
In accordance with UK accounting practices, no compensation expense is recognised for the fair value of options granted where the exercise price equals the market price at date of grant or options granted under approved Sharesave schemes.

b The BT Employee Sharesave schemes.
Incentive Share Plan and Retention Share Plan The BT Incentive Share Plan ISP and the BT Retention Share Plan RSP were introduced for employees of the group in 2000.
Under the plans, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally awarded to participants.
Under the ISP participants are normally only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group.
If the company has exceeded the pre-determined corporate performance measure the participants may be awarded up to double the shares conditionally awarded.
The corporate performance measure assesses the companys overall performance against those top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the Financial Times the FTSE 100 index, at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
Under the RSP the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest in annual tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the individual is still employed by the group.
During the 2003 financial year, 374,039 2002 162,772 shares vested in 11 2002 12 participants in the RSP.
Executive Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan The BT Executive Share Plan ESP was introduced for employees of the group in 1994.
Under the ESP, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally awarded to participants.
Participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a five-year period under the ESP if, at the end of the period, the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure.
Awards of shares were granted in each of the years from 1994 to 1999 under the ESP.
In 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 ESP participants could invest 50% of their annual bonus in the ESP for the purchase of shares.
These invested shares were matched by the company.
The corporate performance measure assesses the companys overall performance against those top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the FTSE 100 index, at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 119 Notes to the financial statements 34.
Employee share schemes continued The fourth five-year performance cycle of the ESP ended on 31 July 2002 and on the basis of the corporate performance measure, the companys Total Shareholder Return TSR target relative to the other companies in the FTSE 100, 32.5% 2002 85% of the shares vested on 1 August 2002 in 65 participants 1 August 2001: 62 participants and 1.0 million shares 1 August 2001 1.2 million shares were transferred to those participants.
The BT Deferred Bonus Plan DBP was established in 1998 and awards were granted to employees of the group in July 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and June 2002.
Under this plan, shares in the company are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and transferred to participants at the end of three years if he or she has continued to be employed by the group throughout that period.
On 1 August 2002, 657,592 shares 1 August 2001 303,326 were transferred to 223 participants 1 August 2001 154 at the end of the three-year deferred period.

These shares had a nominal value of 0.3 million and a market value of 10.7 million at 31 March 2003.
The values of possible future transfers of shares under the plans were based on the BT Group plc share price at 31 March 2003 of 157p 2002 280p.
The provisions for the costs of the ISP, RSP and ESP were based on best estimates of the companys performance over the plans conditional periods, relating to those portions of the plan conditional periods from commencement up to the financial year end.
Employee Share Investment Plan From December 2001 the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP was in operation.
The ESIP, which has been approved by the Inland Revenue, gives UK employees an opportunity to purchase shares partnership shares monthly out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of 125 per month.
During the 2003 financial year, 5.3 million shares 2002 0.7 million shares were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 12,092 employees at a total cost of 10.6 million 2002 1.8 million.
The free shares element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years.
A phantom plan, which delivers cash awards equivalent to the value of the free shares, operates for employees outside the UK.
In 2003, 2% of pre-tax profits, amounting to 36 million, was set aside for the ESIP and the phantom plan for employees outside the UK 2002 25 million.
The allocation of this sum was subject to two performance targets, one of increasing earnings per share by 25% and the other of reducing customer dissatisfaction by 25%, both of which were achieved.
The ESIP replaced the BT Employee Share Ownership Scheme which operated for employee profit sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP for employees in the US enables participants to purchase ADSs quarterly at a price the Base Option Price which is 85% of the market price of an ADS at the start of the offer and in the case of employees who have joined the ESPP after the start of the offer, 85% of the market price on the date of joining, whichever is higher.
At 15 May 2003, 69,164 shares have been issued under the BT Group ESPP.
As the ADS price has been less than the Base Option Price since the date of the quarterly purchase in July 2002 the ESPP has been suspended until the ADS price rises above the Base Option Price.

Auditors The auditors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2003 for the group was 2,943,000 2002 2,702,000, 2001 3,639,000.

In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non audit services can be provided by the companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value added benets to the company.
Under the terms of BTs main licence the group is required to publish audited regulatory financial statements.
The fees for regulatory work principally reect the audit fees associated with those regulatory financial statements.
The fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax advisory services.
The fees for systems advice in the year ended 31 March 2003 related to advisory services provided in connection with the implementation of certain billing systems.
These services, which were provided by PwC Consulting, the consulting business of  that was sold to IBM in October 2002, commenced in the prior year and are now completed.
Financial instruments and risk management The group holds or issues financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments for example trade debtors and trade creditors arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies.
Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, gilt locks, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The types of financial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation.
Short-term investing in financial instruments is undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain dened derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversication and maturity proles.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the groups net debt reduced from 13.7 billion to 9.6 billion.
2.6 billion was realised from the disposal of the groups interest in Cegetel Groupe SA in the year, and the group has closed out 2.6 billion of associated xed interest rate swaps.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole therefore remains at 88:12 at 31 March 2003.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 121 Notes to the financial statements 36.
Financial instruments and risk management continued During the year ended 31 March 2002, net debt was reduced from 27.9 billion to 13.7 billion mainly by the groups rights issue, disposal of its Yell business, its Japanese and Spanish interests, and the property sale and leaseback transaction.
The proceeds of the rights issue and sale of assets were applied mainly in reducing short-term borrowings.
The group repaid substantially all of its medium-term notes and commercial paper in that year.
As a result of the demerger of the mmO business including its European operations, the group swapped an 2 additional e7 billion into oating rate sterling debt.
This, in conjunction with the novation of 1 billion xed rate swaps to Telereal for the property transaction, enabled the group to maintain its xed:oating ratio at approximately 88:12 at 31 March 2002.
During the year ended 31 March 2001, net debt increased from 8.7 billion to 27.9 billion mainly as a result of the group making acquisitions of businesses and third-generation mobile licences.
This increase in debt was funded primarily by the issuance of long-term debt together with use of the groups medium-term note programme.
As a result of this, together with the groups interest rate swap activity, the borrowing prole changed during that year from one mainly at oating rates to one with a xed: oating rate ratio of approximately 70:30.
This change was in line with the groups intention to limit the groups exposure to interest rate increases given the substantial size of the groups debt portfolio at the time.
During the second quarter of the year ended 31 March 2001, it was not practical for the group to issue longer-term debt in the global capital markets.
The group therefore pre-hedged its desired xed rate prole by transacting 9.3 billion of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from five to 30 years at a weighted average xed interest payable rate of 6.2%.
The group uses financial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its non-UK assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The group also hedges some of its interest liabilities.
The financial instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, gilt locks and interest and currency swaps.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2003 and the date of these financial statements.
The notional amounts of derivatives summarised below do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate to interest and exchange rates.
a Interest rate risk management The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Under gilt locks, forward sales of UK government long-dated treasury stock were entered into for periods of up to one year.
This hedge effectively xed in the interest on part of the groups then future borrowings, all of which have now been taken on.
At 31 March 2003, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements having a total notional principal amount of 5,170 million 2002 7,870 million.
b Foreign exchange risk management Cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the groups operations and the groups net assets.
The group also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge investments, interest expense and purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally US dollars and the euro.
The remaining terms of the currency swaps are up to 30 years and the terms of currency forward exchange contracts are typically less than one year.
The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 31 March 2003, the group had outstanding foreign currency swap agreements and forward exchange contracts having a total notional principal amount of 14,545 million 2002 16,670 million.
The fair values of forward foreign currency contracts at 31 March 2003 were 673 million 2002 864 million for purchases of currency and 1,041 million 2002 1,582 million for sales of currency.
These fair values have been estimated by calculating their present values using the market discount rates, appropriate to the terms of the contracts, in effect at the balance sheet dates.
At 31 March 2003, the group had deferred unrealised gains of 2 million 2002 1 million and losses of nil 2002 13 million, based on dealer-quoted prices, from hedging purchase and sale commitments, and in addition had deferred realised net gains of 10 million 2002 20 million.
These are included in the profit and loss account as part of the hedged purchase or sale transaction when it is recognised, or as gains or losses when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
122 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Notes to the financial statements 36.
Financial instruments and risk management continued c Concentrations of credit risk and credit exposures of financial instruments The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk.
The group, however, is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
The group does not normally see the need to seek collateral or other security.
The long-term debt instruments issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants that if the group credit rating was downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A minus in the case of S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In May 2001, Moodys downgraded BTs credit rating to Baa1, which increased BTs interest charge by approximately 32 million per annum.
BTs current credit rating from S&P is A minus.
Based upon the total debt of 12 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2003, BTs annual interest charge would increase by approximately 60 million if BTs credit ratings were to be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1 A minus.
If BTs credit rating with Moodys was to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual interest charge would be reduced by approximately 30 million.
