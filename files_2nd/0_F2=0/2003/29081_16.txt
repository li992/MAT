The diluted revenue returns per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2003 have been calculated in accordance with FRS 14 under which the convertible bonds note 16 are regarded as dilutive if, on conversion, the increased returns attributable to equity shareholders arising from the interest saved less taxation, divided by the increased weighted average number of shares, are less than the basic returns per ordinary share.
These calculations assume that conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares takes place on 1 January 2003, at an exercise price of 399p for the 2011 Bonds and 480p for the 2013 Bonds.
As there are revenue losses, the convertible bonds do not have a dilutive effect on revenue returns in either period.
The diluted revenue returns per ordinary share have also been calculated assuming the exercise of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from the share options in issue see note 19.
As there are revenue losses, the options do not have a dilutive effect on revenue returns in either period.

Schroder Ventures International Investment Trust plc Notes to the Accounts continued 30.
RISK The following disclosures relating to the risks faced by the company are provided in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and other financial instruments disclosures.
Financial instruments and risk profile The Companys principal investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing primarily in an international portfolio of buy-out and development capital funds, which are managed or advised by Schroder Ventures or Permira.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated nancing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available for dividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date.
Currency risk The Company is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be signicantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The 53 Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
The Company does have a 285m loan facility which, if drawn, would act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
Non-interest bearing assets represent the Funds and co-investments, and other short-term debtors.
The Company did not hold any xed rate assets.
RISK continued Financial liabilities of the Group The Company issued 40.0 million nominal of 10 year 4.5% subordinated convertible bonds in November 2001, of which 0.5m nominal was converted into ordinary shares on 9 January 2003 and 0.1m nominal was converted into ordinary shares on 10 November 2003.
The Company issued a further 49.0 million nominal of 10 year 4.5% subordinated convertible bonds in the current year.
The Company does not have any other borrowings at the balance sheet date, although it does have in place a loan facility of 285 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing this risk as summarised below.
This policy has remained substantially unchanged since the launch of the Company.
Interest rate risk The Companys revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since the majority of its income derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on short-term loans that may be taken out from time to time.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately below.
Valuation risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A 54 breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 18 to 21 and a detailed analysis of the twenty largest underlying companies is given on pages 13 to 17.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 37 and 38, all underlying investments are valued by the Directors in accordance with the current guidelines issued by the British Venture Capital Association BVCA, adopting the overriding BVCA principle that the value should be a fair one.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development Stage Equity Investments and Early Stage Equity Investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in levels of borrowing and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
At 31 December 2003, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups Fund portfolio, including UK listed equity funds, and co-investments would result in a 10.8% change in net asset value per share.
The Directors believe that the diversied nature of the Companys portfolio and the number of underlying investments in the Funds significantly reduces the risks normally associated with making investments in the buy-out and development capital markets.
Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular Funds.
In a majority of the Funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding duciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor under the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
Commitment risk The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 18.
At 31 December 2003, the Group had significant uncalled commitments of 594.4 million, compared to its consolidated net assets of 526.6 million.
It is anticipated that over the longer-term, and in normal circumstances, commitments would be nanced by distributions received on the realisation of existing investments.
In addition, the Group has a 285 million loan facility that could be drawn on to meet commitments as they fall due.
However, a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
