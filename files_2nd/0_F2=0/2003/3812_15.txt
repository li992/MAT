Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in full in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and they have arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss making for some time or in subsidiaries where the length of time that the loss remains available is limited.

50 Computacenter plc 14 Investments continued Acquisitions Germany and Austria On 2 January 2003, the Group acquired GE CompuNet in Germany and GECITS in Austria for an initial consideration of 38,134,000.
Because the audited value of the net assets at completion was lower than stipulated in the purchase agreement, Computacenter anticipates receiving a repayment of 32,448,000 from GE Capital, the vendors, resulting in a net consideration for the acquisition of 5,686,000.
Elements of this repayment calculation are disputed by GE Capital and in accordance with the purchase agreement,  has been appointed, as an independent expert, to settle the matter.
The Board has reviewed the likely outcome and is confident that this is properly reflected in the Groups accounts.
The assets of each of the acquired companies have been included in the Groups balance sheet at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Further consideration may be payable to the vendor, contingent on the result of the acquired businesses in 2004.
No provision has been made for further payments, based on the actual performance in 2003 and the likely performance for 2004.
Contingent liability On 15 October 2003, the vendors claimed that the Group had breached a provision of the German purchase agreement concerning an adjustment relating to tax assets, and have issued a claim for 52,165,292 36,762,000, plus interest, for upfront payment for the tax assets as opposed to payment as the assets are utilised.
The Group rejects this claim and legal proceedings are now pending between the parties.
On the basis of legal advice received, the Board is confident that this claim is without merit and will be defended accordingly.
No provision for this claim has been made in the Groups accounts.
