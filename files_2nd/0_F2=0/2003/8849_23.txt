In addition the tax rate would be impacted by the extent to which losses are available to offset taxable income.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of the overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures other than in the case of the groups captive insurance company where cumulative deferred tax of 0.5 million credit for the year 0.4 million has been provided on an accrued dividend.

This is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue calculated as 216,938,883 2002 217,829,287 to give basic earnings per share of 56.2 pence 2002 49.0 pence.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue adjusted by the dilutive outstanding share options and long term incentive plan.
These adjustments give rise to an increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,279,946 2002 2,357,398, giving diluted earnings per share of 55.9 pence 2002 48.5 pence.
Before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and the tax thereon, basic earnings per share were 62.6 pence 2002 60.4 pence and diluted earnings per share were 62.2 pence 2002 59.7 pence.

At 1st April 2000, the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the UK schemes assets was 633.0 million, the actuarial value of which represented 141% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to that date, making full allowance for future salary and pension increases.
This represents an actuarial surplus of 164.2 million.
A surplus cannot be refunded to the group except by dissolution of the scheme in accordance with the rules of the scheme and relevant legislation.
The group has recommenced company contributions this year at a rate of 10% of pensionable pay.
The financial assumptions applicable to the last actuarial valuation at 1st April 2000 were: long term rate of investment return 6.75%, dividend increase rate 4%, general salary and wage inflation rate 5% and pension increase rate 3%.
In accordance with the applicable accounting standard, the surplus on the groups principal UK pension fund has been spread over the average of the expected remaining service lives of current employees 12 years as a variation from regular cost.
The regular pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
Synetix operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes which required contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The employees in the defined benefit schemes have joined the groups principal UK pension scheme and from 1st April 2003 the assets of the defined contribution schemes will be held in a separate section of the groups principal UK pension scheme.
The groups other UK pension schemes relate to Meconic Limited.
Meconic operates a number of defined contribution schemes and one scheme, closed to new members on 31st December 1998, providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of these schemes are held in separately administered funds.
At 31st December 1999, the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the defined benefits schemes assets was 18.6 million, the actuarial value based on 95% of market value of which represented 104% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to that date, making full allowance for future salary and pension increases.
This represents an actuarial surplus of 0.8 million which has been spread over the average of the expected remaining service lives of current employees 10 years as a variation from regular cost.
The regular pension cost is assessed using the attained age method.
The financial assumptions applicable to the last actuarial valuation at 31st December 1999 were: long term rate of investment return 7.0% reduced to 5.0% in respect of the period post retirement, general salary and wage inflation rate 4.5% and pension increase rate 3%.
On 1st April 2003 the Meconic defined benefits scheme will be merged into the groups main UK scheme and a full actuarial valuation of the enlarged scheme is being undertaken as at that date.

The groups largest foreign scheme is in the US, which is of the defined benefit type and which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
This scheme is accounted for using the applicable US accounting standard.
The cost of obtaining actuarial valuations for the purpose of adjusting to the applicable UK accounting standard is considered to be out of proportion to the benefits to be gained.
iii Other retirement benefits These costs are charged on an accruals basis similar to that used for pensions.
The actuarial liability for the cost of these benefits is fully provided for in the balance sheet.
iv Profit and loss account and balance sheet impact of providing retirement benefits The effect of providing pensions and other retirement benefits on operating profit was as follows: 2003 2002 million million United Kingdom Regular pension cost 14.1 12.5 Variation from regular cost 7.5 8.2 Interest on prepayment 7.3 7.0 Cost of post-retirement medical benefits 0.4 0.4 0.3 2.3 Overseas Cost of foreign pension schemes 6.2 4.5 Cost of post-retirement medical benefits 1.4 0.8 7.3 3.0 The following prepayments and provisions relating to pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are included in the group and parent companys balance sheets: Group Parent company 2003 2002 2003 2002 million million million million Prepaid pension costs in the UK 115.9 107.7 115.9 107.7 Prepaid pension costs overseas 11.9 3.0 Provision for foreign pensions 1.7 1.0 Provision for post-retirement medical benefits UK 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.1 Provision for post-retirement medical benefits overseas 12.2 12.7 v FRS 17 Retirement Benefits disclosures group The group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US.

19 Financial risk management The groups approach to managing financial risk is described in the Financial Review on page 10.
19a Market price risk The group monitors its interest rate and currency risks and other market price risks to which it is exposed primarily through a process known as sensitivity analysis.
This involves estimating the effect on profit before tax over various periods of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Most of the groups borrowings and deposits are at floating rates.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.4% impact on group profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar since Johnson Mattheys largest single overseas investment is in the US.
A 5 cent 3.2% movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling has a 1.6% impact on group profit before tax.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.

The fair value of the US Dollar Bonds 2006 is calculated by discounting cash flows based on the three year Treasury Bond rate plus a margin reflecting current market conditions.
The fair value of the other bonds and related currency and interest rate swaps is approximately equal to book value as the bonds were issued and the swaps effective from 26th March 2003, there being no material movement in rates prior to 31st March 2003.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts represents the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts to year end exchange rates.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their size, short term nature or the fact that they bear interest at floating rates.
19g Gains and losses on hedges Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These forward contracts are revalued to the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and any aggregate unrealised gains and losses arising on revaluation are included in other debtors other creditors.
At maturity, or when the contract ceases to be a hedge, gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
