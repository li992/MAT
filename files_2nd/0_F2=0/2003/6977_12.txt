Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2003 1 Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements, except where stated below.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Previously the Group and Company included shares held by its Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST in investments together with the matching liability in Creditors: amounts falling due with in one year.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 18 Accounting policies it is more appropriate to carry the shares at nil cost as they were acquired by the QUEST by way of a fresh issue.
The comparatives for 2002 have been restated by reducing investments and creditors by 1,554,000, there is no impact on the profit and loss account.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March 2003.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
An associated undertaking is one in which the Group holds for the long term a participating interest of usually between 20% and 50% and exerts significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the company.
The Groups share of the results, recognised gains and losses and net assets of associates and of joint ventures undertakings over which it exercises joint control are included in the consolidated financial statements by applying the equity method of accounting.
In the consolidated balance sheet goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures after 1 April 1998, less any amortisation or impairment write-down, is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
Before 1 April 1998, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates was written off immediately against reserves.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and the joint venture are stated at cost less amounts written off for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys profit and loss account to the extent that they represent a realised profit for the Company.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
Intangible fixed assets Treatment of goodwill Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 April 1998, when Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs, any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 April 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life, normally 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 April 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging crediting the unamortised amount of any related goodwill negative goodwill.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are stated at cost less any impairment in value.
Licences Expenditure incurred on the purchase of licences and successful applications and re-applications for licences is capitalised to the extent allowable under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 34 Pre-contract costs as an intangible fixed asset and amortised on a straight line basis over the remaining period of the licences.
Development expenditure Development costs are capitalised and deferred so as to match them with their expected future income where, in the opinion of the directors, the income stream is reasonably certain and sufficient to at least match the capitalised costs.
GWR Group plc Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2003 36 Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at their purchase price less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values, on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 2% Transmitters 5% Fixtures and technical equipment 10%-33% Motor vehicles 20% Leasehold land and buildings are amortised over 50 years or, if shorter, the period of the lease.
Finance and operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets.
The capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The interest element is charged against profit in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee.
Such a transfer is presumed where, at the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments included in any initial payment, amounts to substantially all 90% or more of the fair value of the leased asset.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the total of the lower of cost and net realisable value of the separate items of stock or of groups of similar items.
Turnover Turnover represents amounts invoiced in respect of all services and goods provided during the year, excluding value added tax and net of advertising agency commission.
The Group has only one material class of business.
During the year the Group entered into barter contracts with its clients with a total value of 2,570,000 2002: 2,225,000.
The barter contracts are recognised in accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 26 Barter transactions for advertising.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account any movements in deferred taxation.
Following the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Tax, full provision without discounting has been made for all timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation.
The effect of this change last year was to increase the deferred tax debtor and reserves at 1 April 2000 by 1,021,000 and to increase the tax charge for the year ended 31 March 2001 by 1,893,000.
Therefore the deferred tax debtor at 31 March 2001 was decreased by 872,000 and the reserves by the same amount.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated at the closing exchange rates.
Profit and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to reserves, net of exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Pension costs Some of the Groups employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, where pension costs are calculated as the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Other Group employees participate in a defined benefit pension scheme.
The funds are valued every three years by a professionally qualified independent actuary.
Pension costs are accounted for on the basis of charging the expected cost of providing pensions over the period during which the relevant company benefits from the employees services.

GWR Group plc Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2003 41 Notes to the financial statements 12 Earnings loss per share The calculation of loss per share is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year of 127,145,369 2002: 124,483,052 and the loss for the financial year of 15,055,000 2002: loss of 15,752,000.
There are no potentially dilutive shares to be included in the calculations as the group made losses on continuing operations.
The calculation of the Headline earnings per share is based on the definition by the UK Society of Investment Professionals formerly the Institute of Investment Management and Research in their Statement of Investment Practice No.
The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year of 127,145,369 2002: 124,483,052 and the adjusted profit of 6,148,000 2002: 5,011,000.

GWR Group plc Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2003 45 Notes to the financial statements 19 Treasury information Treasury Management The Groups treasury operations are managed by the Group Finance Department.
Financial instruments, including derivatives, are only permitted for use in managing financial risk arising from the Groups operations on the authority of the Board.
No derivative financial instruments were used during the year ended 31 March 2003 or in the year ended 31 March 2002.
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to credit, interest and foreign exchange translation.
The policies for managing these risks are summarised below.
Credit risk Exposures within certain limits are permitted only with banks or other institutions meeting required standards as assessed normally by reference to the major credit rating agencies.
Deals are authorised only with banks with which dealing mandates have been agreed.
Foreign exchange risk The Group does not have any foreign exchange transaction exposure due to the fact that all revenue and expenses of trading companies within the Group are incurred in their relevant functional currency.
Foreign currency translation exposure arises from the retranslation of overseas subsidiaries profit and loss accounts and balance sheets into Sterling.
The Group does not currently use any foreign currency borrowings or forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the impact of exchange rate movements on the Groups profit and loss account and balance sheet.
However, it will do so if the board considers such hedging to be economically viable.

Deferred taxation provided in the accounts, which represents the total potential asset or liability for deferred taxation, is as follows: 2003 2002 Group 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances 372 373 Other timing differences 806 850 Tax losses carried forward 862 316 1,223 2003 2002 Company 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances 94 138 Other timing differences 30 124 138 21 Pension obligations The Group operates an occupational contributory pension scheme.
Permanent employees aged between 18 and 60 years are eligible to join the scheme after completing 12 months of service with the Group.
With effect from 1 April 2001 the scheme has been contracted back into SERPS and is fully stakeholder compliant.
This scheme is funded by the payment of contributions to a separately administered fund, which is independent of the Groups finances.
Eligible employees at Radio Trent Limited, Leicester Sound Limited and Mercia Sound Limited are members of the Midland Radio Group Pension Scheme MRGPS, whose joint principal employers are GWR Radio Services Limited and Birmingham Broadcasting Limited.
The pension scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable pay, contributions being charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the current unit method.
The most recent valuation was at 30 September 2002.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments pre retirement 9.0%, post retirement 8.0% and the rates of increase in salaries 6.0% and pensions 3.75%.
The most recent actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 4,467,000 at 30 September 2002 the share of this relating to GWR was 1,732,000 and that the actuarial value of those assets was exceeded by the schemes liabilities by 16% the equivalent ratio for GWRs share is 19%.
The rate of contribution made in the current year was 12.7% with currently agreed future rates of contribution to be between 12.7% and 24.2%.
The pension charge for the year of 1,199,000 2002: 1,173,000 included 68,000 2002: 68,000 in respect of the amortisation of experience deficits that are being recognised over 16 years, the average remaining service lives of employees.
Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension costs, under Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benefits FRS 17 the following transitional disclosures are required: A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 September 2002 and has been updated by a qualified independent actuary on a FRS 17 basis as at 31 March 2003.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 2003 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% 3.75% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00% 2.75% and 3.00% Discount rate 5.30% 6.00% Inflation 2.50% 2.75% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions that, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The premium arising on these shares was originally recorded in the merger reserve rather than, as required, in the share premium account.
However the issue was not eligible for merger relief under section 131 of Companies Act 1985, so the premium arising on these shares has been transferred from the merger reserve to the share premium account.
Subsequent transfers from the merger reserve to the Group profit and loss account in relation to goodwill amortisation have also been revised appropriately.
There is no effect on previously reported results for any period as a result of this restatement.
