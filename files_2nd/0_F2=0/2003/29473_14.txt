BASIS OF PREPARATION The information on pages 90 to 93 shows the Groups results as measured on an achieved profit basis, which includes the results of the Groups unit trust business on a similar basis to the ABI Guidance Supplementary Reporting for long term assurance business the achieved profits method issued in December 2001.
The assumptions used to determine the unit trust achieved profit result are consistent with those used for life business, which are disclosed on pages 84 and 85.
The unit trust achieved profit is determined on an unsmoothed basis.
The achieved profit results for long-term assurance have been determined using an unsmoothed basis for projecting future unit growth.
As previously disclosed in the 2003 Interim Report, the 2002 results have been restated to an unsmoothed basis.
The effect of this change to an unsmoothed basis was also disclosed in the 2002 financial statements and is summarised in note D below.
