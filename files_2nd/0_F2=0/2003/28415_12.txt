Operating profit and related earnings per share include investment returns at the expected long-term rate of return but exclude amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items.
The directors believe that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
Profit on ordinary activities and related earnings per share include these items together with actual investment returns.
This basis of presentation has been adopted consistently throughout these financial statements.
