This was against a background of challenging conditions in several of the groups markets.
In line with the groups strategy of recycling capital, 556 million was raised through disposals, compared with total capital investment of over 440 million.
The retail portfolio weighting increased by three percentage points to 68% at the end of the year.. 08 There was a sound performance from the groups retail properties in the UK and France, which showed good underlying rental growth and valuation increases.
Particular highlights were the completion and opening of Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham in September and the encouraging progress in the groups retail parks business.
Our entry into the retail parks market at the end of 2002 has proved to be very successful and the portfolio continues to offer excellent growth prospects.
Conditions in the London and Paris office markets were challenging in 2003.
As a consequence, our three office schemes, completed towards the end of the year at a total cost of 268 million, remain unlet.
However, we recently announced the first letting at One London Wall and I am encouraged by the increasing level of interest from prospective occupiers.
Since the year end Hammerson has arranged a 300 million unsecured bond issue with a term of 22 years.
This further strengthens the groups financing structure and balance sheet.
At the end of January 2004, a major block of Hammerson shares, amounting to nearly 20% of the Companys equity and previously owned by Standard Life Investments, was successfully placed with a wide range of existing and new shareholders.

and the portfolio continues to offer excellent growth prospects.. 11 Business Review The strategy we have followed has generated growth in adjusted net asset value per share over the past five years of 10% per annum and in adjusted earnings per share of 7% per annum.
During the same period, dividends increased by 5.6% per annum and the total return to shareholders has averaged 17.5% per annum.. 12 Over the past five years, Hammerson has maintained its policy of actively recycling its capital.
During this period some 2 billion has been raised from property disposals, whilst acquisitions have totalled 1.5 billion and almost 1 billion has been invested in new developments and improvements to existing assets.
We have completed and successfully launched three major shopping centres in the UK, entered and achieved critical mass in the retail parks sector and enhanced our business on the continent.
Hammerson now has a portfolio of the highest quality.
The group has many opportunities for future developments in the UK and France.
We are working in partnership with a number of towns and cities on major retail-led schemes and have the potential to expand and improve several of our shopping centres.
Development remains an important part of Hammersons strategy.
Regeneration and development require private capital.
Access to this capital would undoubtedly be helped by the introduction of tax transparent vehicles, an issue that is on the agenda in both the UK and France.
Indeed, Hammerson has announced that it will be seeking a listing of its shares on Euronext, in order to benefit from the introduction of the new SIIC tax exempt status in France.
The UK Government is expected to start consultations in connection with the introduction of a tax transparent vehicle for property ownership in the UK.
We believe such a vehicle could prove attractive to all parties, including investors, the property industry and the Government.
Whether or not such a vehicle is introduced, Hammerson will continue to focus on achieving a balance between earnings growth and capital appreciation.
The strategy we have followed has generated growth in adjusted net asset value per share over the past five years of 10% per annum and in adjusted earnings per share of 7% per annum.
During the same period, dividends increased by 5.6% per annum and the total return to shareholders has averaged 17.5% per annum.
It remains our objective to continue to drive Hammersons performance and generate attractive returns to shareholders.

This success has been forged on Partnership.
A partnership of three investors coming together to form The Birmingham Alliance and embracing a fourth partner, Birmingham City Council.
A partnership between the Alliance and the many organisations and individuals involved in the planning and construction of the project.
A partnership with the retailers who have brought vitality and excitement to the scheme.
Above all a partnership with the people of Birmingham who are benefiting from a revitalised city centre.

Partnership a hallmark of Hammersons approach.. 14.
16 Ten years ago Hammerson identified the Paris region, as a very attractive area for major expansion.
At that time the group owned a small portfolio of office properties in central Paris.
Acquisitions in the mid nineties of two shopping centres, Espace St Quentin in Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines and Les 3 Fontaines in Cergy Pontoise, were the foundations for the groups successful expansion in France.
Today, Hammerson owns a portfolio of six major shopping centres, and a number of mixed use and office buildings in France valued at over 1.1 billion.
Active management has enabled Hammerson to boost the rents from its properties, increasing the value of the portfolio.
At the same time the portfolio value has been further enhanced by the increasing demand from other investors who are now recognising the attractions of the French property market.
V Vi is si io on n Year end value of Hammerson's French portfolio Hammersons vision has created a portfolio million 1,135 1,056 in France which has consistently generated 902 826 high returns.
17 Over the last two years, HAMMERSON has built a major presence in the retail parks sector.
The groups first acquisition, Parc Fforestfach in Swansea, in August 2002 was closely followed by its successful 190 million bid for the publicly quoted Grantchester Holdings PLC.
2 Besides owning 200,000 m of income producing property, the latter 2 offered the potential for additional development of around 100,000 m of high quality space.
In the last 12 months, Hammersons retail parks team has secured planning consent for over 2 75,000 m of this additional space.
In 2003, the groups total return from this portfolio was 14.8%.
P Pe er rf fo or rm ma an nc ce e From left to right John Bywater, UK Managing Director David Atkins, Director, Retail Parks The retail parks portfolio offers excellent potential for continued good performance in the future.. 18.
19 Market Overview ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT The global economy improved substantially in 2003 and preliminary figures for the UK show the economy to have expanded by 2.3%, compared with 1.8% in 2002.
The outlook is for a further increase in growth in 2004.
Conditions in the Eurozone, particularly in France and Germany, proved to be more difficult with little growth overall in 2003.
Looking ahead, both France and Germany should see higher growth and more favourable conditions in 2004.
UK RETAIL Retail sales volumes for comparison goods grew by 4.5% in 2003, compared to 8.1% in the previous year.
Despite this slowdown in growth, regional shopping centres and retail parks continued to attract retailers and their customers and therefore generate rental growth.
Investor sentiment towards retail property remained strong throughout 2003 and there was further downward movement in retail yields.
LONDON OFFICES In the London office market, occupational take-up increased by around 20% in 2003, albeit from the low levels experienced in 2002.
This was primarily due to higher take-up in the City of London, with the second half of the year seeing a more positive business sentiment and improving economic environment.
Whilst this is encouraging, take-up in absolute terms remained comparatively low.
Furthermore, a large number of new developments were completed, leading to increased vacancy levels.
Consequently, over the course of 2003, prime rents fell by around 10% in both the City and the West End.
The completion of speculative developments will increase new supply further during 2004.
Encouragingly, development starts have fallen sharply in the past twelve months, with the effect that little new space is projected to be added to office supply during 2005 and 2006.
With improving demand from occupiers, a recovery in rents can be anticipated.
Investor demand has been concentrated on prime offices let on long leases to strong covenants, rather than higher risk properties with imminent vacancy or other uncertainties.
Investor demand should be maintained as the occupational market recovers.
Investor sentiment towards retail property remained strong throughout 2003 and there was further downward movement in retail yields.. 20 FRANCE RETAIL French retail sales volumes for comparison goods grew by 2.5% in 2003 compared to just 1.3% in 2002, with demand from retailers being focused in high-turnover locations, supporting rental growth in major shopping centres.
The indexation terms of French leases, which are linked to construction inflation, boosted rental income on many existing leases by 2.1% from the start of 2003.
Looking forward, improvements in the rate of growth of the French economy and in consumer confidence are forecast to sustain further rental growth.
There were few transactions involving major shopping centres in the French market in 2003.
Nonetheless, the strong demand for those assets that have come to the market has supported prime yields on shopping centres in the Paris region.
PARIS OFFICES Occupational demand rose in central Paris in 2003 compared to the previous year, although much of the demand was for secondhand space.
Given the restrictions on office development in the area, the volume of new supply that can be added in the Central Business District is limited.
Consequently, even at a time of weakness in the office cycle, the vacancy rate in central Paris rose by less than one percentage point to 5.7% in the year to 31 December 2003.
Prime headline rents fell by between 5% and 10% during 2003.
Looking ahead, an improvement in the economic outlook is expected to give occupiers the confidence to take space in the prime central Paris locations.
The Paris office market has remained popular with investors, particularly the German open-ended funds who have been active purchasers during 2003.
Due to strong demand from such investors, prime yields on offices have remained stable.
GERMAN RETAIL Despite a revival in business sentiment, confidence among German consumers has so far failed to recover, with unemployment remaining high.
This was reflected in retail sales volumes falling by around 1% in 2003, applying downward pressure to retail rents.
Although an improvement in economic growth and consumer confidence is anticipated, the outlook for sales and rental growth remains subdued.
The Paris office market has remained popular with investors, particularly the German open-ended funds, who have been active purchasers in 2003.. 21 Objectives and Strategy Objectives FINANCIAL The group invests in assets to create value for shareholders by achieving returns above its cost of capital.
The business is financed by an appropriate mix of shareholders equity and debt so as to enhance the return to shareholders.
In this way, Hammerson seeks to achieve its primary financial objective of an annual return on equity greater than its cost of equity, whilst maintaining a sound financial structure and adopting appropriate risk management procedures.
CORPORATE Hammersons objective is to build on its position as one of Europes most successful real estate companies, by exploiting its key competitive advantages, including its reputation for innovation, the quality of its relationships and its financial strength.
Business Strategy Hammersons strategy is to invest in, develop and manage properties in key European markets.
Hammersons strategy provides the group with a range of attractive investment opportunities.
This enables Hammerson to increase returns by taking advantage of different market cycles.
Recycling of capital is fundamental to this strategy.
Management carries out rigorous reviews of each property in its portfolio, benchmarking performance against its hurdle rates.
In addition, Hammerson is able to share ideas, information and contacts between the teams at its various operations.
By investing in retail property in more than one country, Hammerson benefits from its excellent relationships with retailers, many of whom are pursuing European expansion programmes, and from its group-wide development and property management expertise.
The groups strategy for its developments has three elements: first, to create properties valued at substantially more than their cost: second, to generate income above the groups cost of finance, thereby increasing earnings per share: and third, to create assets which would be difficult to acquire on the open market and which offer potential for good growth in income and capital.
Financial Strategy The Board believes that shareholder returns can be enhanced by active management of the groups debt and equity capital.
The return of capital to shareholders, including the purchase of the Companys own shares, is evaluated against alternative investment opportunities and takes account of the share price compared with net asset value per share.. 22 Risk Management The management of risk is an integral part of Hammersons approach to running its business.
It is addressed in the annual Business Plan and is subject to regular review both to assess progress and reflect changes in economic and investment conditions.
Set out below are some of the key risks and how these are managed.
MARKET RISK The group follows a policy of investing in politically stable, sound economies in the UK and continental Europe in the retail and office sectors.
It is therefore diversified both by country and sector.
The group makes extensive use of research to help it to identify future market trends.
PROPERTY RISK Hammersons properties are generally of high quality and in prime locations.
Hammerson has therefore been able to attract as tenants large businesses, professional firms and major retailers.
Many of the groups leases are long term with varying expiry dates and, in the UK, upward only rent reviews.
This reduces the risk of having to attract new tenants or renegotiate rents for a substantial part of the portfolio at a period of weak occupational demand.
Hammersons retail properties are, to a certain extent, protected from competitor action by the restrictive planning regulations in the countries in which the group operates.
Development risk is managed by phasing the development programme, by rigorous project management and procurement, and by timely marketing and letting of major developments.
In the case of very large projects, Hammerson often reduces its risk by entering into joint ventures.
The balance within the portfolio between investment and development is monitored so as to control the overall development risk at any one time.
Post completion reviews identify lessons to be learnt from projects and these contribute towards improving the way in which future projects are managed.
TREASURY RISK Hammerson operates a centralised treasury function with clear authorities for the implementation of the treasury objectives and policies established by the Board.
The treasury department operates as a cost centre and not as a profit centre and there are internal controls to ensure that no transactions can be undertaken on a speculative basis.
Regular reports are produced which enable management to monitor and control treasury activities closely.
In order to maintain operational flexibility, Hammersons policy is to borrow on an unsecured basis on the strength of the groups covenant.
Management arranges the groups borrowings to maintain short term liquidity and ensure an appropriate maturity profile and balance between fixed and floating rate debt.
HUMAN RESOURCES Attracting and retaining the right people is important to Hammersons business.
The group employs skilled local teams with good experience of their markets.
Hammerson encourages staff to build on their skills, through appropriate training and regular performance appraisals, to enable them to contribute to the growth of the group.
REPUTATION Hammerson has an excellent reputation for its property management and development skills.
To enhance its reputation Hammerson is careful to ensure that it communicates clearly with its customers, suppliers, local communities and other stakeholders and acknowledges their views and opinions.
Directors and senior management are encouraged to represent the Companys views by serving on the boards of industry bodies such as the British Property Federation, British Council of Shopping Centres, City Property Association, the European Public Real Estate Association and Fdration des Socits Immobilires et Foncires.. 23 Corporate Responsibility Hammerson recognises its responsibilities to others.
Our customers, suppliers, staff, shareholders and the local communities in which the groups properties are located, all have a direct interest in the way we run our business.
The group recognises the importance of effective communication with all these audiences.

Hammerson is a member of both Dow Jones SGI and FTSE4Good Indices, as well as a participant in Business in the Environments annual index of corporate environmental engagement.
During 2003, the group produced its first Corporate Responsibility Report.
This has been updated to reflect the groups performance on meeting its objectives and this information can be found in the document Corporate Responsibility 2004, which accompanies these accounts, and on Hammersons website www.
Hammerson was the winner of the Built Environment category of the 2004 Liveable City Awards.
25 Portfolio Review At 31 December 2003, Hammersons portfolio had a book value of 3,956 million.
The retail component of the portfolio increased from 65% at the beginning of the year to 68% at 31 December 2003.
Retail parks now account for 11% of the groups portfolio.
The distribution between the UK and continental Europe was unchanged at 66% and 34% respectively at year end.
Total capital additions amounted to 364 million in 2003.
Of this 202 million was invested in the development programme, 101 million was attributable to acquisitions and 61 million was spent on the existing portfolio.
Hammerson now has a retail portfolio of 16 major shopping centres and 11 retail parks, providing over one million square metres of retail space.
The groups office portfolio consists of 12 prime office buildings located in central 2 London and central Paris with a total area of over 220,000 m. During 2003, the group renewed over 130 expiring leases and carried out over 50 rent reviews, which, together with rent reviews and renewals in 2002, resulted in an underlying increase in rents of 6.9%.
The value of the development programme at 31 December 2003 was 328 million compared with 468 million at the end of the previous year.
This reduction reflects the completion of Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham in September 2003 and the completion of office developments in London and Paris.
VACANCY At the end of 2003 the vacancy within the groups portfolio stood at 9.2% compared with 5.0% at the end of 2002.
The increase resulted mainly from the completion, in the second half of 2003, of the three office developments at One London Wall and 10 Grosvenor Street, London and No, 14 boulevard Haussmann in Paris, each of which were unlet at 31 December 2003.
Excluding these properties the portfolio vacancy rate would have been 5.6%.. 26 Portfolio Review.

VALUATION MOVEMENTS During 2003, there were contrasting performances from the retail and office portfolios.
The retail portfolio showed an underlying increase in value of 7.1%, whilst there was an underlying decrease in the value of the office portfolio of 5.1%.
This resulted in an overall increase in the valuation of the portfolio of 2.9%.
In the UK, the abolition of stamp duty in disadvantaged areas added 32 million to the property valuations.
The properties in France have been valued on the assumption that, following tax changes introduced by the French Government, future disposals are more likely to be effected through the sale of properties rather than the sale of the groups property owning subsidiary companies.
The result is that additional transfer tax of approximately 30 million has been deducted from the value of the French properties.
The good performance in the UK and French retail portfolios mainly reflected rental growth and asset management initiatives.
In the UK, valuation yields for prime shopping centres improved slightly whilst in France they remained broadly stable.
By contrast, in Germany, continued investor uncertainty in the face of subdued consumer markets resulted in a valuation decline of 5.5%.
The decline in the value of the groups office portfolio principally reflected the difficult market in London caused by the continuing caution on the part of occupiers, increased vacancy levels and lower market rents.
The office portfolio in Paris decreased in value by 3.7% as rental levels reduced.. 28 TOTAL RETURN The total return from the portfolio was 8.7% in 2003, compared with 5.3% in the previous year, with the increase mainly attributable to the positive valuation movement in the retail portfolio.
INCOME QUALITY At 31 December 2003, the passing rent from the groups portfolio amounted to 210 million and the average unexpired lease term was ten years.
Within the retail portfolio, the average unexpired lease term for shopping centres was ten years and for retail parks 16 years.
The average unexpired lease terms for the office portfolios in London and Paris were eight and five years respectively.
The groups five largest retail tenants accounted for 10.9% of total passing rent and comprised: Hennes & Mauritz 3.0% : Dixons 2.5% : Next 2.0% : Arcadia 1.8% and Boots 1.6%.
Given the spread of tenants in the retail portfolio, the overall risk to Hammerson of individual tenant default is considered low.
The groups three largest office tenants accounted for 13.1% of total passing rent and comprised: Deutsche Bank 7.0% : Network Rail 3.5% and Lazard 2.6%.
In addition, the group has pre-let its development at Bishops Square, London, to Allen & Overy, and Hammersons share of the annual rent on completion of the development will amount to 27 million.
RENT REVIEWS In 2003, UK rent reviews with a passing rent of 2 million were agreed, giving rise to an increase in annual rents of 1 million, whilst reviews remaining to be settled from 2003 could increase rents by a further 3 million.
In the UK, leases subject to rent review in 2004 to 2006 have current rents passing of 80 million.
Management estimates that, on review, rents receivable in respect of these leases would increase by 6 million to 86 million by 2006 if reviewed at current rental values.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of increases or decreases in rental values before the relevant review dates.

Most of the leases were renewed or the tenants replaced and, because the expiring leases were at rents below market levels, additional annual income of 3 million was secured.
Over the three years 2004 to 2006, leases with current rents passing of 31 million are subject either to expiry or tenants break clauses.
Management estimates that, assuming renewals at current ERVs, additional annual rents from this element of the portfolio would total 1 million by 2006 as shown in the table below.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of void periods, tenant incentives, or possible changes in rental values before the relevant lease expiry dates.

29 Portfolio Review continued RETAIL PORTFOLIO The groups retail portfolio had a book value of 2,705 million at 31 December 2003.
The retail portfolio was 14% reversionary, with annual rents passing of 147 million, compared with a current estimated rental value of 174 million.
The latter figure includes vacant space and rent reversions due after 2006.
The shopping centre portfolio was 13% reversionary and the retail park portfolio 22% reversionary.
The vacancy rate in the retail portfolio at the end of the year was 4.6%, compared with 3.1% at the end of 2002.
The principal reason for the increase was that a number of properties in the retail parks portfolio are vacant pending redevelopment.
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY Hammersons retail portfolio mainly comprises prime regional shopping centres that dominate their catchment areas, retail parks and city centre properties that could form part of future retail-led developments.
The value of retail property acquisitions amounted to 101 million during 2003, whilst proceeds from disposals were 252 million.
During 2003, the group continued to expand its retail park portfolio.
In February, Sittingbourne Industrial Park was acquired for 17 million.
The ten hectare site is situated close to the town centre and currently comprises light industrial and warehouse units.
Hammerson is working on proposals for a retail-led redevelopment.
In November, the group acquired the largest retail park in Sheffield, Drakehouse Retail Park, at a cost of 60 million.
The current leases have an average unexpired term of 19 years.
In December, Hammerson and Standard Life Investments jointly acquired the freehold interest in Brent Cross Shopping Park, a development close to Brent Cross Shopping Centre, London NW4.
Hammersons interest in the retail park is 40.6% and its share of the initial cost for the site was 18 million.
Hammersons total commitment to 2 the development, including the initial consideration, is 30 million.
On completion, the 8,600 m scheme will be the largest open A1 retail park in North London.
In the UK, the B&Q retail warehouse in Romford was sold for 21 million in April and, in July, the groups leasehold interest in Merseyway Shopping Centre, Stockport was sold raising 128 million.
Sprowston Retail Park, Norwich, was sold in September for 13 million.
In Germany, the sale of Luisencenter, Darmstadt, was completed in December for a consideration of 71 million, 66 million of which was received before the year end, with the balance expected to be received in 2004.
Contracts were also exchanged for the sale for 20 million of Hammersons 22% interest in City Center shopping centre, Essen and the adjacent car park.
Following the reduction of the size of its business in Germany, Hammerson has outsourced the property management of its three remaining retail properties and will be closing its Berlin office.
DEVELOPMENTS Bullring shopping centre was completed in September, at a total cost to Hammerson of 170 million, and opened more than 95% let.
Hammersons share of the estimated annual income is 13.3 million.
Hammerson was the 2 development manager for the scheme undertaken by The Birmingham Alliance.
The 110,000 m shopping centre, in the heart of Birmingham, has proved extremely successful to date with over 20 million visitors in the six months since opening.
2 The major refurbishment of the 49,000 m Liberty Centre, Romford was completed in April.
Over 95% let at completion, these works have resulted in a significant improvement in the tenant mix and the overall rental value of the centre.
2 In June, Hammerson was granted planning consent for the 23,600 m Cyfarthfa Retail Park at Merthyr Tydfil.
The total development costs are estimated to be 35 million and work started in February 2004.
Lease agreements have been signed with tenants for 52% of the projected rental income.
In October, Hammerson was granted planning consent for the St. Oswalds Retail Park in Gloucester.
Work on the first phase of the development is expected to start in the second half of 2004 at a total cost of 52 million.
Since the year end, Hammerson has received planning 2 consent for the development of a 7,500 m retail park in Thanet, Kent.
It is anticipated that construction will begin at the end of 2004, with total development costs expected to be 14 million.. 30 The Bristol Alliance, a partnership between Hammerson, Land Securities and Morley Fund Management, has made good progress on its development proposals for the Broadmead area of Bristol and the necessary planning consents 2 are in place for the 90,000 m retail development.
A leasing campaign is underway and site assembly is progressing with a view to construction starting in 2005.
The group is also working with local authorities and landowners in several other major towns and cities, including Aberdeen, Barnet, Birmingham, Kingston-upon-Thames, Leeds, Leicester, Peterborough and Sheffield, to advance potential retail-led development schemes or expansions to existing centres.
In France, the group continued to advance plans for improvements and refurbishments to a number of its retail assets, including Les 3 Fontaines in Cergy Pontoise, Espace Saint Quentin in Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines and Parinor in Aulnay sous Bois.
OFFICE PORTFOLIO The groups office portfolio had a book value of 1,251 million at 31 December 2003, and annual rents passing of 64 million.
The portfolio was 12% over-rented, compared with 7% at the end of 2002, reflecting the decline in rental values in the London and Paris office markets.
Three development schemes completed towards the end of the year, 10 Grosvenor Street, London W1, One London Wall, London EC2, and No, 14 boulevard Haussmann, Paris 9me, remained unlet.
As a result the office vacancy rate at the end of the year was 26.8%, compared with 11.3% at the end of 2002.
INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY Office capital additions in 2003 amounted to 173 million.
The disposals of Globe House, London WC2, and 16 Old Bailey, London EC4, in March, raised 194 million, whilst the sale of 53 quai dOrsay, Paris 7me, in July, raised a further 76 million.
2 Two office developments in central London were completed during 2003.
A lease for 2,930 m of space has been signed with the leading international law firm, Dewey Ballantine, at One London Wall and negotiations are underway with prospective occupiers at both that property and at 10 Grosvenor Street.
The development at Moorhouse is progressing and is expected to be completed towards the end of 2004.
2 The construction of Bishops Square, London, is progressing well.
The 75,000 m office building has been pre-let to Allen & Overy and is expected to be completed in June 2005.
A marketing campaign will begin shortly for the 2 3,700 m of retail space.
2 In Paris, the letting of 2,900 m of office accommodation at 148, rue fide lUniversit to GIE SC Autoroutes leaves only 2 2 1,600 m of the 10,300 m building unlet.
2 September 2003 saw the completion of the development of No, 14 boulevard Haussmann, a 26,700 m office building.
Hammerson is in discussions with a number of potential tenants, but the market in Paris remains competitive with occupiers cautious.
2 2 At 9 place Vendme, Paris, work started in January 2004 on a scheme comprising 22,900 m of offices and 5,300 m of retail space in a 50:50 joint venture with AXA.
Hammersons share of the total cost of the project is 96 million and completion is scheduled for Spring 2006.
In February 2004, the group sold 21 Moorfields, London EC2, to raise sale proceeds of 48 million.. 31 Financial Review PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT Net rental income was 189.5 million in 2003 compared with 175.9 million in 2002.
Within net rental income, 3.3 million related to turnover rent and there was 8.8 million of accrued rent receivable allocated to rent free periods.
An analysis of net rental income is shown below: 2003 2002 m m Properties owned throughout 2003 and 2002 142.6 133.4 Acquisitions 28.6 13.7 Developments 5.0 2.7 Properties sold 13.3 30.3 Exchange translation and other 4.2 189.5 175.9 Administration expenses in 2003 rose by 0.5 million to 24.8 million, although 2002 included 2.6 million for rationalisation costs at Grantchester.
Increased staff costs and professional fees relating to tax restructuring in France were the principal reasons for the increase.
The groups net financing costs were 78.7 million in 2003 compared with 66.0 million in 2002, reflecting higher levels of debt following the purchase in late 2002 of Grantchester and other acquisitions and the holding costs of completed developments.
The average cost of borrowing was 6.0% compared with 6.1% in 2002.
Interest cover was 1.8 times compared with 1.9 times in 2002.
Profit before tax was 67.1 million, after deducting losses on the sale of investment properties of 18.8 million.
This loss arose principally on the sale of the Luisencenter, Darmstadt.
Adjusted profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, was 85.9 million, an increase of 0.4% compared with 2002.
The tax charge in 2003 was 14.8 million, of which 13.1 million was deferred tax.
The current tax charge of 1.7 million represented an effective tax rate of 2.0% on profits before disposals.
The low tax rate was principally due to tax losses available from previous years being offset against UK tax payable for 2003, together with capital allowances and relief for capitalised interest.
Adjusted earnings per share, after excluding losses on disposals and deferred tax, were 29.8 pence compared with 29.2 pence in 2002, an increase of 2.1%.
A final dividend of 11.71 pence per share is proposed which, together with the interim dividend of 5.12 pence per share, makes a total of 16.83 pence per share for the year.
This represents an increase of 6.5% over the total dividend for 2002.
CASH FLOW Cash flow from operating activities was 174 million, with the increase of 26 million compared to 2002 mainly attributable to increased rental income and the favourable timing of working capital receipts and payments.
This increase was largely offset by the additional cost of financing acquisitions and development expenditure.
The cash outflow from acquisitions and other capital expenditure was 441 million, which was more than offset by the proceeds of 556 million from the disposal of assets.
After paying dividends of 44 million there was a cash inflow, before financing, in 2003 of 139 million.. 32 Financial Review BALANCE SHEET At 31 December 2003, Hammersons investment property portfolio was valued at 3,956 million, compared with 3,908 million at the end of 2002.
The increase arose from capital additions of 364 million, a revaluation surplus of 111 million and exchange translation gains of 109 million, partly offset by the disposal of properties with a book value of 536 million.
The development properties within the investment portfolio were valued at 328 million, 26 million above cost.
Developments are shown at a valuation that is discounted for the estimated costs to complete, including interest, and a profit margin that a potential purchaser might apply.
The group does not intend to dispose of any of its developments prior to their completion.
Adjusted net asset value per share, after excluding deferred tax, increased by 52 pence or 6.9% to 803 pence at the year end.
The portfolio revaluation accounted for 40 pence of this increase, with the balance reflecting exchange translation movements and retained profits.
BORROWINGS At 31 December 2003, the groups borrowings were 1,772 million.
Undrawn committed facilities at the same date were 182 million.
The weighted average maturity of borrowings at 31 December 2003 was approximately eight years.
During the year, secured borrowings of 184 million were repaid and cancelled, so that at the year end 99% of debt was unsecured.
With cash and deposits of 187 million, net debt amounted to 1,585 million.
Gearing at 31 December 2003 was 73% compared with 81% at the end of 2002.
The market value of borrowings at the year end was 1,940 million, some 168 million greater than the book value, equivalent, after tax relief, to 42 pence per share.
During 2003, the margin above government bonds of Hammersons bonds fell significantly which had the effect of increasing the market value of debt by 42 million.
In February 2004, Hammerson issued 300 million 6% unsecured bonds maturing in 2026.
The proceeds of the issue have been swapped into floating rate debt, currently at a rate of 5.2%.
As a result of this issue, the average maturity of the groups debt has increased to ten years.
RETURN ON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY At 9.3%, Hammersons return on equity was above the groups estimated cost of equity of 8.0%.
The principal reason for this was the uplift in value of the property portfolio.
Over the last three years the group has achieved an average return on equity of 7.3%.
TAXATION At the end of 2002, the French Government announced new regulations enabling real estate companies listed in Paris to elect for the Socits dInvestissements Immobiliers Ctes SIIC tax status, under which property income and capital gains are exempt from French tax.
Hammerson is applying for a listing of its shares on the Premier March of Euronext, Paris, the French Stock Exchange.
Such a listing, provided it is obtained by 30 April 2004, will enable Hammerson and its French subsidiaries to elect for SIIC tax status.
It is envisaged that elections will be made, with retrospective effect from 1 January 2004, covering all the groups properties in France with the exception of 9 place Vendme, Paris.
Hammersons elected French subsidiaries will be required to pay a one-off exit charge, payable in four equal annual instalments, calculated at 16.5% of their latent capital gains at the time they enter the SIIC regime.
There is an additional requirement that Hammerson plc continues to be a French-listed property investment business for ten years to avoid the charge being recalculated at full rates.
The elected French subsidiaries will be required to pay dividends equal to 85% of their net accounting profit on income and 50% of their net accounting capital gains on disposals.
However, the dividend payment obligations of the French subsidiaries will be reduced by interest and depreciation.
These intercompany dividends will, when received, be taxed in the UK.
Hammerson plc will be under an obligation to pay dividends at least equal to the intercompany dividends received but, in the foreseeable future, the amounts are expected to be small and therefore will not affect the Companys dividend policy.. 33 Financial Review continued If elections are made, the following effects on the groups 2004 accounts are anticipated: Provision for exit tax of approximately 70 million B100 million, payable in four equal annual instalments with the first payment in December 2004.
The write back of previously provided deferred tax of approximately 45 million B64 million.
The exit tax of 70 million will be accounted for as a charge in the profit and loss account of 45 million and a charge in the statement of recognised gains and losses of 25 million.
The release of 45 million of deferred tax will be credited in the profit and loss account.
Pro forma shareholders funds following these two adjustments would be: Pence per million share Shareholders funds at 31 December 2003 2,168 784 Exit tax payable 70 25 Deferred tax provision no longer required 45 16 Pro forma shareholders funds at 31 December 2003 2,143 775 In addition to the deferred tax release, the groups contingent tax liability as at 31 December 2003 would be reduced by approximately 121 million.
Therefore, taking the 45 million deferred tax release and the 121 million contingent tax reduction net of the 70 million exit charge, Hammersons pro forma triple net NAV would increase by 96 million or 35 pence per share.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS With effect from 1 January 2005, all companies quoted in the European Union will be required to adopt IFRS.
Hammerson will continue to report under UK Accounting Standards up to and including 31 December 2004, but will move to IFRS in 2005.
The International Accounting Standards Board is in the process of finalising the standards that must be adopted in 2005 and has stated that this work will be completed by the end of March 2004.
If the adopted standards are substantially unchanged from the existing proposals, they will have a significant impact on Hammersons financial statements.
It is likely that the main changes will include the recognition of property revaluation surpluses and deficits in the income statement rather than the statement of recognised gains and losses: the inclusion in the balance sheet of contingent tax that may arise on the disposal of properties: and the treatment of certain leasehold property interests as finance leases rather than investment properties.
There remain areas of uncertainty which have not yet been resolved.
These include the application of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and guidance from the Inland Revenue on the tax implications of the adoption of IFRS.
Hammerson will continue to monitor developments and manage the transition to IFRS and will provide more information on the impact on its financial statements as it approaches the change.
URGENT ISSUES TASK FORCE UITF ABSTRACT 38 ACCOUNTING FOR ESOP TRUSTS UITF 38 was issued in December 2003 changing the accounting treatment for a companys own shares held for Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs.
The UITF requires that such shares be included in the balance sheet as a deduction from shareholders funds rather than held as an asset.
Comparative figures have been restated and net assets have been reduced by 2.2 million at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account.. 34 Summary Directors Report PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW The principal activities of the Company have continued to be property investment and development.
A review of the groups activities and results for the year is given in the Chairmans Statement and on pages 12 to 34.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR AND DIVIDENDS The results for the year are set out in the Summary Consolidated Profit and Loss Account on page 38.
The profit before tax for the year was 67.1 million.
After tax and minority interests the profit attributable to shareholders was 50.3 million.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 11.71 pence per share which, together with the interim dividend paid on 31 October 2003, will make a total dividend for the year of 16.83 pence 2002: 15.8 pence.
It is intended that warrants in respect of the final dividend will be posted on 12 May 2004 for payment on 13 May 2004 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 16 April 2004.
DIRECTORS AND THEIR REMUNERATION The names and biographical details of the directors are given on pages 6 and 7.

35 Summary Remuneration Report THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE The Committee currently comprises R J O Barton Chairman, J C Clare and G F Pimlott.
The Committee meets to consider, for recommendation to the Board, Company policy on the remuneration of executive directors and to approve the composition and level of remuneration of executive directors and certain senior executives.
The Board has accepted, without amendment, the Committees recommendations relating to remuneration policy.
In determining an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board, the Committees objective is to ensure that the Company continues to be able to attract, retain and motivate experienced individuals, who are capable of making a major contribution to Hammersons success.
Remuneration for executive directors and senior executives takes account of performance through an annual performance related bonus scheme and, for long term performance, by the award of shares under the Companys deferred share plan.
In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of investors and their representatives.
To assist the Committee in determining remuneration policy, the Committee has received advice from Hay Group who have been appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the Company.
In addition, although they are not members of the Committee, information and advice has been provided and recommendations have been made by R R Spinney, R J G Richards other than in respect of his own position and by the groups Director of Human Resources, E A Houlihan.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for performance related bonuses or grants of options and their fees are not pensionable.
A resolution to amend the rules of the deferred share plan in respect of the performance targets is to be put to the Annual General Meeting.
Full details are included in the Circular to Shareholders and Notice of Meeting that accompanies this Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements.
