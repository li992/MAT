Financial Statements Five Year Record The financial information set forth below for the twelve month periods ended 31 December 2003, 2002 and 2001, and as at 31 December 2003 and 2002 has been derived from the consolidated financial statements of the Group included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The information should be read in connection with, and is qualied in its entirety by reference to, the Groups consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
Financial information set forth below for the twelve month periods ended 31 December 2000 and 1999, and as at 31 December 2001, 2000 and 1999, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for 2001, 2000 and 1999.
The financial information in this selected consolidated financial and statistical data does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 1985.
The auditors report in the financial statements for each of the five years ended 31 December 2003 was unqualied and did not include a statement under sections 237 2 and 237 3 of the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group, for the years ended 31 December 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, were audited by Deloitte & Touche, independent accountants.
The Groups consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
Certain significant differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP are discussed in note 58 to the consolidated financial statements, and notes 61 and 62 to the consolidated financial statements includes reconciliations of certain amounts calculated in accordance with UK GAAP to US GAAP.
2 Prior to 2000, Depreciation on operating lease assets was reported as a charge against income on operating lease assets within Commissions, fees and other income.
Such income continues to be reported within Commissions, fees and other income, however, following an accounting presentation change, Depreciation on operating lease assets is now reported within Operating expenses, but shown as a separate item within that heading because such assets are used for a different purpose to xed assets used in administrative functions.
The prior year comparative for the year ended 1999, was restated with the effect being a 52m increase in Commissions, fees and other income.
This change results from the application of FRS 15, Tangible xed assets, which first applied to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2000.
3 Equivalent US dollar amounts are shown in Shareholder information Dividends on ordinary shares, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
4 The calculation of the gross equivalent dividend per ordinary share applies a tax rate of 10% for grossing-up purposes for dividends.
5 Prior to 2002, Reserve capital instruments were reported as a component of non-equity shareholders funds, with coupon payments treated as a non-equity appropriation of profit.
Following an accounting presentation change, Reserve capital instruments are now reported within Subordinated liabilities, with coupon payments recorded as Interest payable, within Net interest income.
The 2001 comparative amounts have been restated to reect this accounting policy change and as a consequence profit before tax has been reduced by 19m, with profits attributable to shareholders remaining unchanged.
Shareholders funds including non-equity interests have been reduced by 297m in 2001.
Comparative amounts for years prior to 2001 are unaffected.
This change results from the application of UITF 33, Obligations in capital instruments, which first applies to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002.
6 The application of FRS 19, Deferred tax, for the year ended 31 December 2002 has resulted in deferred taxation being provided on all timing differences that have not reversed before the balance sheet date at the rate of tax expected to apply when those timing differences will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are now recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Previously, deferred taxation was accounted for where it was probable that a liability or asset would arise.
The 2001 and 2000 comparative amounts have been restated to reect this accounting policy change and as a consequence the tax charge has been reduced by 24m 2001, 16m 2000 and 17m 1999, respectively.
Shareholders funds including non-equity interests have been increased by 120m 2001, 96m 2000 and 80m 1999 respectively.
7 Amounts stated in dollars have been translated from sterling at the rate of 1.00 $1.7842, the noon buying rate on 31 December 2003.
Abbey Annual Report and Accounts 2003 191 Financial Statements Five Year Record continued 8 Prior to 2002, the costs of equity-based instruments issued to employees under compensation schemes were generally accounted for under the intrinsic value method.
Abbey now accounts for the costs of share-based instruments on a fair value basis.
The costs of share-based payments are computed by reference to the grant date: such costs are expensed over the vesting period of the instrument.
The 2001 and 2000 profit and Loss accounts and statements of total recognised gains and losses comparative amounts have been restated to reect this accounting policy change and as a consequence profit before tax has been reduced by 6m 2001 4m 2000, and 3m 1999, respectively, with a corresponding credit to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
No prior period adjustment to shareholders funds is required.
9 In 2002 certain adjustments were made to period end market values in reporting long term assurance business.
The 2001 and 2000 comparative amounts have been restated to reect this change in accounting policy.
The reported earnings in these periods have been reduced by 443m and 102m, respectively.
See note 21 Long term assurance business for further information.
Determination of the impact on reported earnings in 1999 is not practicable.
10 Prior to 2003, the holding of Abbeys own shares was reported as Own Shares Held and reported within Other Assets.
These have now been reclassied as Treasury Shares and are now deducted from Shareholders Funds in accordance with UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
Prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.
11 Determination of the split of net income between continuing operations and discontinued operations, and the related earnings per share amounts for 2000 and 1999 is not practicable.

192 Abbey Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Financial Statements Five Year Record continued 7 The non-performing loans used in these statistics are calculated in accordance with conventional US denitions.
The value of non-performing loans represents the aggregate outstanding balance of all loans and advances 90 days or more overdue or, for unsecured loans less than 90 days overdue, the balance of loans where a provision has been made or interest suspended.
Interest continues to be debited to substantially all of these loans and advances for collection purposes.
The proportion of this interest whose collectability is in doubt is then suspended and excluded from the profit and loss account.
Accordingly, the interest income gures included in the profit and loss account are the same as would be reported in the United States.
However, the value of non-performing loans is higher by the cumulative amount of this suspended interest.
In cases where borrowers have made arrangements to pay off their arrears over a period of time, the arrears remain on the loan accounts until cleared and as a result the loans are included in non-performing loans even though the customers are currently performing and many will ultimately discharge their loans fully.
Abbey generally holds a first mortgage over the properties securing the UK residential mortgage loans.
The value of the security will in many cases completely cover the value of the loan and the arrears and in the remainder will considerably reduce the size of the loss incurred.
Non-performing loans also include the full value of loans for which Abbey has enforced its security by taking into possession the borrowers properties.
In many such cases the value of the losses expected to result on sale of the security is known with some certainty and is included in the specic provisions.
However, the value of the losses is not charged off until the properties are sold and the losses have thus been determined precisely.
Other banks, including those in the United States, may charge off losses more rapidly.
Although Abbeys practice does not affect net income or the carrying value of loans and advances to customers, it does increase the reported value of non-performing loans.
For these reasons, the value of the non-performing loans is not necessarily indicative of the value of losses which Abbey is likely to suffer.
Management believes that it is important to consider the quality of Abbeys UK residential mortgage portfolio compared with those of its competitors.
Over the reporting periods covered by this table, the number of mortgage loans which are six months or more in arrears as a percentage of the total number of outstanding mortgage loans has been broadly comparable with the UK Council of Mortgage Lenders CML industry average.
At 31 December 2003, Abbeys percentage was 0.19% compared with a Council of Mortgage Lenders percentage of 0.36%.
The value of these Abbey non-performing loans as a percentage of its total UK residential mortgage loan assets was 0.16%.
Non-performing loans in this table also include the value of arrears cases between three and six months in arrears and the value of properties in possession.
On this basis, the non-performing UK residential mortgage loans are 0.1% of its total UK residential loans and advances.
If the remainder of Abbeys loans and advances excluding finance leases are included, this ratio increases to 3.25%.
8 For the purpose of calculating the ratios of earnings to xed charges, earnings consists of income before taxes plus xed charges.
Fixed charges consists of interest payable, which includes the amortisation of discounts and premiums on debt securities in issue and interest payable on finance lease obligations.
9 These ratios have been restated for each of the comparative periods due to the US GAAP total assets being restated.
Exchange rates The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain information concerning the exchange rate for pounds sterling based on the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in foreign currencies, as certied for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, expressed in US dollars per 1.00.
No representation is made that amounts in pounds sterling have been, could have been or could be converted into US dollars at the noon buying rate or at any other rate.
The noon buying rate for US dollars on 10 February was $1.8697.
