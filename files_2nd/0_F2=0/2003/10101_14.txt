Unfunded Pensions The SSAP 24 provision see note 18 relates to UK unfunded pensions payable to certain retired employees who are not members of the Company defined benefit schemes.
The unfunded liability has been calculated by a qualified independent actuary.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on this unfunded liability are the future rate of interest, assumed to be 5% per annum.
The pension charge for the year in respect of unfunded pensions was 0.3 million 2002: 0.3 million Funded pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in the UK and one non-UK defined benefit scheme.
Two major schemes represent over 83% of the assets of the Group's defined benefit schemes.
The following details refer to these two schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The contributions are determined by the schemes' independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the Aggregate method.
The most recent valuation was at 5th April, 2001.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the differential between the rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries.
It was assumed that the former would exceed the latter by 2.2% per annum.
The most recent actuarial valuation at 5th April 2001 showed that the combined market value of the schemes' assets was 142.6 million and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 111% of the combined benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Contributions of 2.0 million 2002: 1.8 million and 0.2 million 2002: 0.2 million were made by the Group respectively to the UK schemes and non-UK scheme.
The agreed contribution rates to the UK schemes for future years are 6% for the parent company schemes and range from 16% to 18% for the other Group Schemes.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in the UK and one non-UK defined benefit scheme.
Full valuations were carried out at 5 April 2001 for the UK schemes and updated to 31st December, 2003 by qualified independent actuaries.
In addition, there are UK unfunded pensions payable to certain retired employees, who are not members of the above schemes.
The major assumptions, which are given in the form of weighted averages, used by the actuaries at 31st December, 2003 were: Defined UK benefit schemes unfunded 2003 2002 2003 2002 % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 3.75 n a n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 Discount Rate 5.40 5.60 5.40 5.60 Inflation assumption 2.75 2.25 2.75 2.25 62 21.

Both schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes as one is not affected by any surplus or deficit in the scheme relating to past service of employees and contributions are set only in relation to the current service period and as in respect of the other, the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The pension costs charge for the year in respect of these schemes and other defined contribution schemes amounted to 0.5 million 2002: 0.5 million.
