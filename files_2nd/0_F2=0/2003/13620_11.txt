32 Rotork Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2003 Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000.
Accounting policies The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements of the Group and of the Company.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention supplemented by the revaluations explained in note 11 to the financial statements and have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The Group is implementing FRS17 Retirement Benefits in accordance with transitional arrangements set out in the standard.
The disclosures required for the financial year ended 31 December 2003 are set out in note 23.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for the year to 31 December 2003.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company only has not been presented, as permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated economic life, which is not expected to exceed 20 years.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year and the results and cashflows of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary undertakings, and from the translation of the results of those undertakings at average rate, are taken to reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
Depreciation and amortisation Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over fifty years or the expected useful life of the building where less than fifty years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Machinery, plant and equipment 10% to 30% Rotork Annual Report 2003 33 Leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and capital, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis in arriving at the operating profit.
Stocks and work in progress Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost on a first in, first out basis and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law, except for the terms explained below.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the assets or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit those earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Turnover Turnover represents gross sales made and services supplied in engineering, excluding value added tax and returns and allowances.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development of the Groups products is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes and contributes to these schemes in accordance with qualified actuaries recommendations.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the remaining working lives of the employees within the schemes.
Further details are given in note 23 to the financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised in the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction is recognised.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the unremitted earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax for taxable gains recognised on revaluation of property or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would only become payable if property was sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief or utilise existing capital losses.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in respect of the revalued properties in the foreseeable future.

Earnings per share Earnings per share is calculated for both the current and previous years using the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders for the year.
The earnings per share calculation is based on 85.8 million shares 2002: 86.1 million shares being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year.
The adjusted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the ordinary shareholders before the amortisation of goodwill.
The adjusted numbers provide a more consistent measure of operating performance.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the ordinary shareholders and 86.2 million shares 2002: 86.5 million shares.
The number of shares is equal to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and contingently issuable shares awarded under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Pensions The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK and overseas, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the Group was 2,331,000 2002: 1,991,000 of which 878,000 2002: 591,000 related to the overseas schemes.
Included in the total pension cost is 412,000 2002: 325,000 in respect of defined contribution pension schemes.
The pension cost relating to the principal scheme that covers the majority of UK employees is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the principal UK scheme was as at 31 March 2001.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed that the investment return would be 5.85%, that salary increases would average 3.5% per annum and that present and future pensions would increase at a rate of 4.5% on service accrued until May 2000 and at 2.5% for service after that date.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the assets of the principal UK scheme was 44,052,000 excluding members Additional Voluntary Contributions.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 97% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
This deficiency should be eliminated by 2006 by increasing the employers contribution rate by 3.2% of pensionable earnings.
The pension costs of the other defined benefit scheme that covers US employees have been determined in accordance with advice from an independent qualified actuary.

Derivatives and other financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Group treasury is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13: Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS13.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary and associated companies are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than the currency disclosures.
