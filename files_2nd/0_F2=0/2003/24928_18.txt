Nor do we underestimate the impact on sentiment and consumer spending of globally strong property prices, which continue to rise faster than underlying wage growth in many developed markets.
While such rises are understandable in the context of low interest rates and limited appetite for alternative investment opportunities, in the long run property prices have to Sir John Bond, Group Chairman be linked to income growth.
The picture, therefore, is one of improving sentiment and stronger growth prospects in the near term, but with the potential risk that structural imbalances might lead to economic weakness, or dislocation.
Against this backdrop, we are concentrating on building our businesses steadily.
We expect to see lending to consumers around the world rise as a proportion of our total lending, with the emphasis on real estate secured lending.
We also expect to see business in the United States grow in importance to HSBC as we fulfil the potential of the Household acquisition and as the US economy shows its flexibility and responds to the lower value of its currency.
We look forward to the future with confidence.
We are second to none in terms of geographical and product diversification.
We believe that Mexico, India, Brazil as well as China will become increasingly important to the global economy.
We also believe many of the worlds largest companies see the same opportunities as we do, and therefore we will use HSBCs position as the worlds local bank to serve their needs.
We have built a capital strength that allows us to develop our businesses wherever we see opportunities.
Alternatively, such strength gives us resilience if economic conditions deteriorate.
We have an excellent customer base with opportunities across the board: in Personal Financial Services, in Commercial Banking where we believe we have the largest international middle-market franchise in the world: and in Corporate, Investment Banking and Markets.
We have a talented workforce and we have a commitment to do business only when it is in the interests of our customers and in line with our wider responsibilities to the communities we serve.

The acquisitions of Household and GFBital increased our technology spending in 2003 by almost US$1 billion to US$3.5 billion.
Households leadingedge systems and expertise in credit cards, consumer lending, risk management and sales will gradually be introduced in other parts of the Group.
Demographic changes also present exciting and important opportunities.
For instance, we will launch initiatives to reflect the growing importance of retirement services in an ageing population and consumer finance for the younger sections of society.
Our efficiency objectives will require a thorough approach to process engineering and global resourcing, which will remain an essential element of our strategy.
Further details of our views on this important topic can be found in a recent speech made by Alan Jebson, Group Chief Operating Officer, which is reproduced on pages 27 to 31.
We need to invest systematically in our people, with special emphasis on cultivating talent.
Diversity will be a major theme.
We believe that cultural diversity is intrinsic to the HSBC brand and one of the keys to remaining sustainably competitive and profitable.
We want to attract the best people and we want the best to rise to the top, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or gender.
We have made good progress, but we recognise we still have some way to go.
2004 is the first year of our plan.
The goals we have set ourselves are challenging but attainable.
I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.

benefit through lower costs and higher incomes.
And companies and their shareholders will also benefit from lower costs, as well as new markets to compete in.
Those Western economies with flexible job markets will be able to adjust and grow in productivity and living standards.
They will be able to move up the value chain by creating higher value work domestically.
In Britain, manufacturing accounted for 26 per cent of total employment in 1979 and less than 13 per cent today.
But equally in the last 25 years, while some 3.3 million jobs were lost in manufacturing, service sector employment rose by 6.5 million.
And the end result of that move from manufacturing into services has been lower unemployment, and a doubling of real average earnings for workers over the last 40 years.
Clearly, some sectors are better insulated from change than others.
Many jobs are geographically fixed.
For instance, leisure and tourism are local in nature: you cant move a hotel or airport offshore, although you can move their sales ledger.
There are others: public sector work, entertainment, hospitals, even agriculture.
The key factor for society, as always, will be education which allows the workforce to move to higher value jobs.
It would be dishonest to say that the transition will always be smooth.
Some of it will inevitably be painful and some of you will have difficult decisions to make.
But it is far less painful to manage the process actively and safeguard the whole, than to 31 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Financial Review Net Interest Income demand.

Donations During the year, HSBC made charitable donations totalling US$47,374,000.
Of this amount, US$17,069,000 was given for charitable purposes in the United Kingdom.
Following its acquisition on 28 March 2003 and until 30 September 2003 to allow time for any commitments to be honoured, Household International continued its previous policy of making political donations in the United States.

On behalf of the Board 1 March 2004 R G Barber, Secretary 44 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report Summary Financial Statement Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee meets regularly to consider human resource issues, particularly terms and conditions of employment, remuneration, retirement benets, development of high potential employees and key succession planning.
During 2003, the members of the Remuneration Committee were Sir Mark Moody-Stuart Chairman, W K L Fung and Sir John Kemp-Welch, all of whom are independent non-executive Directors.
S Hintze, an independent nonexecutive Director, was appointed a member of the Committee on 30 January 2004.
There were eight meetings of the Remuneration Committee during 2003.
All of the members attended each of these meetings.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on www.
com by selecting About HSBC, then Board of Directors, then Board Committees.
During 2003, the Committee conducted a review of external specialist remuneration consultants.
After a rigorous selection process, the Committee retained the services of Towers Perrin, a rm of specialist human resources consultants, who provide independent advice on executive remuneration issues.
A further selection process will take place in 2006.
As a global rm, Towers Perrin also provide other remuneration, actuarial and retirement consulting services to various parts of HSBC.
Other than the provision of expert advice in these areas to the Remuneration Committee and to HSBC, Towers Perrin have no connection with HSBC.
Other consultants are used from time to time to validate their findings.
The Remuneration Committee also receives advice from the Group General Manager, Group Human Resources and the Senior Executive, Group Reward Management.
General Policy on Employees As with most businesses, HSBCs performance depends on the quality and commitment of its people.
Accordingly, the Boards stated strategy is to attract, retain and motivate the very best people.
In a business that is based on trust and relationships, HSBCs broad policy is to look for people who want to make a long-term career with the organisation since trust and relationships are built over time.
Remuneration is an important component in peoples decisions on which company to join, but it is not the only one: it is HSBCs experience that people are attracted to an organisation with good values, fairness, the potential for success and the scope to develop a broad, interesting career.
Within the authority delegated by the Board of Directors, the Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy of HSBC including the terms of bonus plans, share option plans and other longterm incentive plans, and for agreeing the individual remuneration packages of executive Directors and other senior Group employees.
No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee applies the following key principles: to ensure that remuneration is competitive in relation to comparative organisations in each of the countries or regions in which HSBC operates: to offer fair and realistic salaries with an important element of variable pay based on relative performance: to have as many top-performers as possible at all levels within HSBC participating in some form of long-term share plan: and since 1996, to follow a policy of moving progressively from dened benefit to dened contribution Group pension schemes for new employees only.
In line with these principles: employees salaries are reviewed annually in the context of individual and business performance, market practice, internal relativities and competitive market pressures.
Allowances and benets are largely determined by local market practice: employees participate in various bonus arrangements.
The level of performance-related variable pay depends upon the performance of HSBC Holdings, constituent businesses and the individual concerned.
Key measures of success include: achievement of financial goals, encompassing both revenue generation and expense control: customer relationships: full utilisation of professional skills: and adherence to HSBCs ethical standards.
HSBC has a long history of paying close attention to its customers in order to provide value for shareholders.
This has been achieved by ensuring that the interests of HSBC and its employees are aligned with those of its shareholders and that HSBCs 45 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement approach to risk management serves the interests of all.
Closer alignment with the interests of shareholders continues to be achieved through the promotion and extension of employee participation in the existing share plans.
Bonus ranges are reviewed in the context of prevailing market practice and overall remuneration: and in order to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, employees generally are eligible to be considered for discretionary awards of share options under the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan.
For the majority of employees, the vesting of share awards under the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan is subject to the attainment of Total Shareholder Return TSR targets full details are set out on pages 48 and 49.
Separate transitional arrangements are currently in place for employees of CCF.
In addition, to allow more employees to participate in the success they help to create, employees may also participate in the HSBC Holdings savings-related share option plans and in local share ownership and profit sharing arrangements.
The impact on existing equity of granting share options which are to be satisfied by the issue of new shares is shown in diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated profit and loss account, with further details disclosed in Note 11 of the Notes on the Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Accounts.
The effect on basic earnings per share of exercising all outstanding share options would be to dilute it by 0.40 per cent.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to respond to the variety of environments and circumstances which are faced by different businesses in different markets at different times.
During 2004, the Committee will conduct a comprehensive and fundamental review of all share-based remuneration.
Before presenting any proposed changes for shareholder approval, the Committee will ensure appropriate consultation is undertaken with shareholders and their representatives.
Directors and Senior Management HSBCs operations are substantial, diverse and international: for example, over 74 per cent of net income is derived from outside the United Kingdom.
HSBC Holdings Board is currently composed of 14 non-executive Directors and eight executive Directors.
With businesses in 79 countries and territories, HSBC aims to attract Directors with a variety of experience, in both its key markets and internationally.
The Board currently includes nationals of seven different countries.
The eight executive Directors, four Group Managing Directors and 27 Group General Managers have in total more than 900 years of service with HSBC.
Directors fees Directors fees are regularly reviewed and compared with other large international companies.
The current fee, which was approved by shareholders in 2000, is 35,000 per annum.
Recent developments in corporate governance and reporting obligations, and the expansion of HSBCs business, continue to increase the commitment required of Directors.
In accordance with the recommendations of an independent external review, the approval of shareholders will be sought at the 2004 Annual General Meeting for the basic fee to be increased to 55,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2004.
In addition, non-executive Directors receive, with effect from 1 January 2004, the following fees: Chairman, Audit Committee 40,000 p. a.
During 2003, five Audit Committee meetings were held.
A Directors commitment to each meeting, including preparatory reading and review, can be as much as 15 hours.
During 2003, eight meetings of the Remuneration Committee were held.
The Nomination Committee met once during 2003.
The terms of reference of the Committee have been broadened substantially and more meetings will be held in 2004 and future years.
Chairman, Corporate Social Responsibility Committee 20,000 p. a.
Member, Corporate Social Responsibility Committee 15,000 p. a.
46 The Corporate Social Responsibility Committee first met in February 2004 and will meet on a quarterly basis.
Executive Directors are normally permitted to retain only one Directors fee from HSBC.
For example, executive Directors who are also Directors of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited may elect to receive a fee from either HSBC Holdings or The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.
Executive Directors The executive Directors are experienced executives with detailed knowledge of the financial services business in various countries.
In most cases, there has been a need to attract them from abroad to work in the United Kingdom.
Having regard to the broad international nature of the Group, the annual market survey of senior executive remuneration takes into account not only remuneration data in the UK but also in other overseas markets.
Consistent with the principles applied by the Committee to employees generally, there are four key components to the executive Directors remuneration: salary: annual cash bonus: long-term incentives: and pension.
The Committee generally provides, on a discretionary basis, long-term share incentives to executive Directors and members of senior management through conditional awards of Performance Shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 rather than through the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan, as explained under Long-term incentive plan below.
The level of awards available to the executive Directors under the annual cash bonus scheme and the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 is entirely dependent on performance.
Remuneration policy for executive Directors is intended to provide competitive rates of base salary but with the potential for the majority of the value of the remuneration package to be delivered in the form of both short and long-term incentives.
This typically results in base salary comprising around 40 per cent of total direct pay and the remaining 60 per cent split equally between annual bonus and the expected value of Performance Share awards.
The remuneration package of W F Aldinger has a smaller proportion of xed salary and a higher proportion of annual bonus and Restricted Share awards.
The awards are in accordance with the minimum level of awards set out under his employment agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition of Household.
Each component of executive Directors remuneration is explained in detail below.
The current approach and structure of remuneration has been in place since 2000 and the Committee believes it has served HSBC well.
The Committee has, however, made the following modications to the performance condition for future awards of Performance Shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 in order to make the condition more relevant and long-lasting: the elimination of any re-testing provision so that awards lapse if the performance condition is not satisfied after the initial three-year performance period: and a change to the benchmark group set out on page 49 to make it more relevant as a benchmark against which HSBCs performance is measured.
The use of Performance Shares and the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 will fall within the Committees review of share-based remuneration to be undertaken in 2004.
Salary The Committee reviews salary levels for executive Directors each year in the same context as other employees.
With respect to market practice and taking account of the international nature of the Group, the Committee benchmarks the salary of each Director and member of Senior Management against those of comparable executives in large, diverse companies.
Base salaries with effect from April 2004 will be: W F Aldinger US$1,000,000 D J Flint 462,500 Sir John Bond 1,202,800 M F Geoghegan 575,000 W R P Dalton 521,500 S K Green 700,000 D G Eldon US$290,340 A W Jebson 515,000 This represents an average increase from 2003 of 18.9 per cent.
47 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement As an International Manager, D G Eldons current base salary, shown above, is calculated on a net basis and will be subject to a separate review in April 2004.
Annual cash bonus Cash bonuses for executive Directors and members of Senior Management are based on two key factors: individual performance, taking into account, as appropriate, results against plan of the business unit or performance of the support function for which the individual is responsible: and Group performance, measured by comparing operating profit before tax with plan.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to eliminate extraordinary items when assessing bonuses, if the main cause did not arise during the current bonus year.
Measurement against these key performance factors may, exceptionally, result in discretionary cash bonuses up to 250 per cent of basic salary.
For 2003, bonuses have ranged from 60 per cent to 250 per cent of base salary, with all but two of the executive Directors and members of Senior Management receiving discretionary bonuses of less than 110 per cent of base salary.
Long-term incentive plan The HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 is the principal long-term incentive plan used to reward the delivery of sustained financial growth of HSBC Holdings.
So as to align the interests of the Directors and senior employees more closely with those of shareholders, the vesting of Performance Share awards is subject to the attainment of a predetermined TSR target.
Awards In recent years, the Remuneration Committee has adopted a policy that the face value of annual awards of Performance Shares to executive Directors and members of Senior Management will not as a general rule exceed 100 per cent of earnings dened as base salary and bonus in respect of the previous performance year.
Additionally, executive Directors and members of Senior Management who participate in the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 have not received awards under the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has proposed to the Trustee of the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 that the following conditional awards should be made to executive Directors in 2004: 000 Sir John Bond 2,100 D G Eldon 750 D J Flint 1,040 M F Geoghegan 780 S K Green 1,430 A W Jebson 1,040 Total 7,140 The Trustee to the Plan will be provided with funds to acquire HSBC Holdings ordinary shares at an appropriate time after the announcement of the annual results.
The 2004 conditional awards proposed for executive Directors and members of Senior Management in respect of 2003 will have an aggregate value at the date of award of 16.86 million.
Under the terms of his employment agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition of Household, W F Aldinger will receive an award of US$5.5 million which will be used to purchase Restricted Shares in HSBC Holdings.
These Restricted Shares are not subject to the TSR performance conditions set out on pages 48 to 50.
One-third of this award of Restricted Shares will vest on each of the three anniversaries following the date of grant.
C F W fide Croisset, who retired from HSBC on 29 February 2004, has not received any awards of Performance Shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan since the acquisition of CCF in 2000.
Rather, in accordance with the arrangements agreed with CCF in 2000, Mr fide Croisset received share option awards under the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan.
The awards in 2001 and 2002 were not subject to performance conditions: 50 per cent of the award made in 2003 was subject to the TSR performance conditions set out below.
W R P Dalton, who is to retire at the Annual General Meeting on 28 May 2004, will not receive an award of Performance Shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan in 2004.
Performance conditions From 1999, the vesting of awards has been linked to the attainment of predetermined TSR targets as set out below.
48 Particulars of executive Directors interests in shares held in the Restricted Share Plan are set out on page 57.
TSR is dened as the growth in share value and declared dividend income, measured in sterling, during the relevant period.
The TSR performance condition for awards of Performance Shares under the Restricted Share Plan remained the same from 1999 to 2003, the five years of the Managing for Value strategy.
For awards made in 2004, changes have been made to the peer group as described below and re-testing provisions have been eliminated so that awards will lapse if the performance condition is not satisfied after the initial three-year performance period.
Having regard to HSBC Holdings size and status within the financial sector, a benchmark for HSBC Holdings TSR has been established which takes account of the TSR performance of: 1. a peer group of nine banks weighted by market capitalisation which are considered most relevant to HSBC in terms of size and international scope.
For performance periods up to and including the one beginning in 2003, this group comprised ABN AMRO Holdings N. V. The Bank of East Asia Limited, Citigroup Inc. Deutsche Bank A. G. J P Morgan Chase & Co. Lloyds TSB Group plc, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd. and Standard Chartered plc.
To be more relevant to HSBC in terms of size and international scope, this peer group has been amended for conditional awards made in 2004 and onwards by the replacement of Lloyds TSB Group plc, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. and The Bank of East Asia Limited with Bank of America Corporation, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Banco Santander Central Hispano S. A. and UBS AG: 2. the five largest banks from each of the United States, the United Kingdom, continental Europe and the Far East, other than any within 1 above, weighted by market capitalisation: and 3. the banking sector of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index, excluding any within paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 above, weighted by market capitalisation.
By combining the weighted average TSR for each of the above three groups and weighting that average so that 50 per cent is applied to paragraph 1, 25 per cent is applied to paragraph 2 and 25 per cent is applied to paragraph 3, an appropriate single TSR benchmark for market comparison is determined.
The extent to which awards will vest will be determined by reference to HSBC Holdings TSR measured against the TSR benchmark.
The calculation of the share price component within HSBC Holdings TSR will be the average market price over the 20 trading days commencing on the day when the annual results are announced, which in 2004 is 1 March.
The starting point will be, therefore, the average over the period 1 to 26 March inclusive.
TSR for the benchmark constituents will be based on their published share prices on 26 March 2004.
If HSBC Holdings TSR over the performance period exceeds the benchmark TSR, awards with a value, at the date of grant, of up to 100 per cent of the individuals earnings, will vest.
For higher value awards, the greater of 50 per cent of the award or the number of shares equating at the date of grant to 100 per cent of the individuals earnings, will vest at this level of performance.
If HSBC Holdings TSR over the performance period places it within the upper quartile in the ranked list against the benchmark, these higher value awards will vest in full.
For performance between the median and the upper quartile, vesting will be on a straight line basis.
For awards made in 2004 and thereafter, under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 only, the initial performance period will be three years from the date of grant.
As before, if the upper quartile performance target is achieved, an additional award equal to 20 per cent of the initial Performance Share award will be made and will vest at the same time as the original award to which it relates.
However, regardless of whether the upper quartile is achieved, full vesting and transfer of the shares will not generally occur until the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
If the performance test is not passed at the third anniversary, the shares will be forfeited.
As a secondary condition, options and awards will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that HSBC Holdingsnancial performance has shown a sustained improvement in the period since the date of grant.
In determining whether HSBC has achieved a sustained improvement in performance the Remuneration Committee will take account of, among other factors, the comparison against history and the peer group in the following areas: 1. revenue growth: 2. revenue mix: 3. cost efficiency: 49 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement 4. credit performance as measured by risk-adjusted revenues: and 5. cash return on cash invested, dividend performance and total shareholder return.
Awards will vest immediately in cases of death.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to recommend early release of the shares to the plan Trustee in certain instances, e. g. in the event of redundancy, retirement on grounds of injury or ill health, early retirement, retirement on or after contractual retirement or if the business is no longer part of HSBC Holdings.
Awards will normally be forfeited if the participant is dismissed or resigns from HSBC.
Where events occur which cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that the performance condition has become unfair or impractical, the right is reserved to the Remuneration Committee to make such adjustments as in its absolute discretion it deems appropriate to make.
Pension The pension entitlements earned by the executive Directors during the year are set out on pages 54 and 55.

The Remuneration Committee will, consistent with the best interests of the Company, seek to minimise termination payments.
No executive Director has a service contract with HSBC Holdings or any of its subsidiaries with a notice period in excess of one year or with provisions for predetermined compensation on termination which exceeds one years salary and benets in kind, save as referred to below.
There are no provisions for compensation upon early termination of executive Directors service contracts save for W F Aldinger and C F W fide Croisset, details of which are set out below.
Mr Aldinger entered into a new employment agreement with Household on 14 November 2002 for a term of three years, such term commencing on the effective date of the acquisition of Household by HSBC.
Full details of the agreement were set out in the Discloseable Transaction Circular relating to the acquisition of Household sent to shareholders on 26 February 2003 in advance of the Extraordinary General Meeting to approve the acquisition.
The terms of the employment agreement, which were an integral part of the Household acquisition that shareholders approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting, are unchanged.
The effective date of acquisition, and commencement date of the contract, was 28 March 2003.
During the term of the agreement, Mr Aldinger will be paid an annual base salary equal to his annual base salary as at the date of the merger agreement between Household and HSBC US$1 million and an annual bonus in an amount at least equal to the annual average of Mr Aldingers bonuses earned with respect to the three-year period ended 2001 pro rated for any partial year US$4 million.
Within 30 days of the effective date, Mr Aldinger received a one-time special retention grant of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 with a value equal to US$10 million.
These Restricted Shares will vest in three equal instalments on each of the first three anniversaries of the effective date, as set out on pages 57 and 58.
After each of the second and third anniversaries of the effective date, subject to the approval of the Trustee of the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000, Mr Aldinger will receive an additional grant of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares with a value equal to at least US$5.5 million.
The purpose of these arrangements is to retain the services of Mr Aldinger through the initial integration of Household.
HSBC considers it is essential that the experience, knowledge and skills of Mr Aldinger be retained for the benefit of HSBC shareholders.
If Mr Aldingers employment is terminated by him during its term for good reason, or by Household for reasons other than cause or disability, he will be entitled to: a pro rata target annual bonus for the financial year of the date of termination: a payment equal to his annual base salary, plus the average of his annual bonuses with respect to the three-year period ended 2001, times the number of full and partial months from the date of termination until the third anniversary of the effective date, divided by 12: the immediate vesting and exercisability of each stock option, restricted stock award and other equity-based award or performance award or cash equivalent that is outstanding as at the date of termination and treatment as retirement eligible for purposes of exercising any such award: for the remainder of his life and that of his current spouse, continued medical and dental benets at Households cost: and his retirement benets as set out on page 54 in a lump sum.
Sir John Bond is employed on a rolling contract dated 1 January 1993 which requires 12 months notice to be given by either party.

On 29 February 2004, Mr fide Croisset took early retirement from the Group, relinquishing his role as Chairman and CEO of CCF.
In light of French legal requirements, a review of market practice was undertaken and it was agreed that a one-off payment of 2,427,000 would be made to Mr fide Croisset, which is considered to be appropriate in all the circumstances.
He will also receive a pension as set out on page 54.

Pensions There are separate schemes for UK-based and overseas-based employees: the UK scheme has a normal retirement age of 60: retirement ages for overseas schemes vary in accordance with local legislation and practice.
Save as stated below no other Director participated in any Group pension schemes, none of the Directors participating in the Groups UK approved pension schemes is subject to the earnings cap introduced by the 1989 Finance Act and only basic salary is pensionable.
With four exceptions see paragraphs below on W F Aldinger, C F W fide Croisset, D J Flint and W R P Dalton, the executive Directors are members of dened benefit pension schemes, having joined HSBC at a time when these were the norm.
Before commencement of his new employment agreement on 28 March 2003, W F Aldinger participated in Household's qualied and non-qualied dened benefit pension plans.
The annual pension benefit under these arrangements was a function of service and a percentage of Final Average Earnings which included bonus.
The nonqualied plans were enhanced before commencement of Mr Aldingers new employment agreement.
The benets under the qualied and non-qualied dened benefit pension plans were then frozen and will be payable in a lump sum on the earlier of the termination of Mr Aldingers employment or on Mr Aldingers retirement.
No further benets have accrued under these arrangements since 28 March 2003.
Since the commencement of his new employment agreement on 28 March 2003, Mr Aldinger has continued to participate in the Household International Tax Reduction Investment Plan TRIP, which is a qualied funded deferred profit-sharing and savings plan for eligible employees, although no employer contributions have been made since 28 March 2003.
Mr Aldinger also participated in Supplemental TRIP a non-qualied plan, which is an unfunded arrangement under which additional employer provision of US$41,539 has been made since 28 March 2003.
The pension arrangements for Sir John Bond, S K Green, A W Jebson to contractual retirement age of 60 are, and for Sir Keith Whitson were, provided under the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme.
The pensions accrue at a rate of one-thirtieth of pensionable salary per year of pensionable service in the UK.
Until his retirement from CCF on 29 February 2004, C F W fide Croisset was eligible for pension benets which were supplementary to those accrued under the French State and Compulsory arrangements.
The amount of this supplementary pension, payable from age 60, accrued at the rate of 6,098 per annum for each year of service maximum 18 years as an executive Director of CCF.
Consequent upon Mr fide Croissets early retirement from CCF and following a review of market practice, it has been agreed to provide a pension of 341,467 per annum equivalent to 32.5 per cent of his average total cash compensation over a three-year period payable from 1 March 2004.
The whole cost of this pension is met by CCF.
The pension arrangements for W R P Dalton to contractual retirement age of 60 are provided on a dened benefit basis details of which are set out in the table below under the HSBC Canada Pension Plan A, at an accrual rate of onethirtieth of pensionable salary per year of pensionable service until his transfer to the UK in 1998.
Since taking up his appointment in the UK, he has joined the HSBC Holdings Overseas No.
1 Pension Plan on a dened contribution basis, with an employer contribution in respect of 2003 of 1,379,000 2002: 529,000 including a bonus waiver of 1,250,000 2002: 400,000.
The pension arrangements for D J Flint to contractual retirement age of 60 are provided through an executive allowance paid to fund personal pension arrangements set at 30 per cent of basic salary.
This is supplemented through the HSBC Holdings plc Funded Unapproved Retirement Benets Scheme on a dened contribution basis with an employer contribution during 2003 of 81,943 2002: 80,092.
The intention of these arrangements is to provide benets broadly comparable to an accrual rate of one-thirtieth of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service.
54 The pension arrangements for D G Eldon are provided under the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benets Scheme.
Pension accrues at a rate of one twenty-seventh of pensionable salary per year of pensionable service.

2 On attaining age 60, Sir John Bond has been able, under the terms of the scheme, to retire at any time with an immediate pension equal to his accrued pension which, at 31 December 2003, is shown above.
3 On attaining age 53, D G Eldon has been able, under the terms of the scheme, to retire at any time with an immediate pension equal to his accrued pension which, at 31 December 2003, is shown above.
4 D G Eldon made personal contributions towards his pension of 14,625 in respect of 2003.
5 A W Jebsons entitlement has been supplemented by an employer contribution of 175,000 in return for the prior waiver of part of his bonus in respect of 2002.
6 Sir Keith Whitson retired from the Group with effect from 30 May 2003, with a gross pension of 287,472 per annum.
Sir Keith Whitson elected to commute part of this pension for a lump sum payment of 664,825 leaving a residual pension of 233,737 per annum.
As a result, the pension in payment at 31 December 2003 is lower than the accrued pension at 1 January 2003.
The increase in accrued pension during 2003 reects the gross pension before commutation.
The transfer value of benets at 31 December 2003 reects both the pension in payment and the commutation lump sum, increased with interest.
The following unfunded pension payments, in respect of which provision has been made, were made during 2003 to four former Directors of HSBC Holdings: 2003 2002 B H Asher 83,277 81,564 R Delbridge 119,777 117,313 Sir Brian Pearse 49,947 48,918 Sir William Purves 88,158 86,343 341,159 334,138 The payments in respect of R Delbridge and Sir Brian Pearse were made by HSBC Bank plc as former Directors of the bank.
Share Options At 31 December 2003, the undernamed Directors held options to acquire the number of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares set against their respective names.
The options were awarded for nil consideration at exercise prices equivalent to the market value at the date of award, except that options awarded under the HSBC Holdings savings-related share option plans before 2001 are exercisable at a 15 per cent discount to the market value at the date of award and those awarded since 2001 at a 20 per cent discount.
The options are categorised as unlisted physically settled share options under the Securities and Futures Ordinance of Hong Kong.
Except as otherwise indicated, no options were exercised or lapsed during the year and there are no remaining performance criteria conditional upon which the outstanding options are exercisable.
The market value of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2003 was 8.78.
The highest and lowest market values during the period were 9.135 and 6.31.

55 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement On 27 August 2003, a payment of 400,000 was made to J M Gray, a former director of the Company and Chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, who retired in 1996.
The payment, which was effected after having taken legal advice, represents compensation in respect of losses suffered by Mr Gray as a result of alleged negligent advice given to Mr Gray at the time of his retirement.
The advice concerned the impact of his retirement on his then existing share options and the time at which these options would lapse.
The compensation payment represents a portion of the loss suffered by Mr Gray on the lapse of those options.
2 The exercise of these options was conditional upon the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period being equal to or greater than a composite rate of ination comprising 50 per cent of the Hong Kong Composite Consumer Price Index, 35 per cent of the UK Retail Price Index and 15 per cent of the USA All Urban Consumer Price Index plus 2 per cent per annum.
This condition has been satisfied.

There are no remaining performance criteria conditional upon which the outstanding options are exercisable.
No options over CCF shares of 5 each were awarded to or exercised by Mr fide Croisset during the year.

The Household options were granted at nil consideration.
No options over HSBC Holdings shares were awarded to Mr Aldinger from 25 April to 31 December 2003.

On meeting all of these three primary tests, 50 per cent of the conditional awards would be released to each eligible participant.
A secondary test would apply such that, if the cumulative earnings per share over the performance period exceeded an aggregate gure calculated by compounding 1997 earnings per share by a factor equivalent to the same annual composite rate of ination as described above, plus 5 per cent or more, or 8 per cent or more, for each year of the performance period, 75 per cent or 100 per cent respectively of the conditional awards would be released.
