The objective of the Achieved Profits Method is to recognise profit as it is earned, arising from contracts of long term insurance business.
The methodology is based on an attribution of the assets of a life assurance company between those backing long term assurance contracts backing assets and the residual assets representing unencumbered capital.
The backing assets cover: i the long term liabilities calculated in accordance with local supervisory requirements: and ii the solvency capital requirements in each country or equivalent where there is no local requirement.
Under the Achieved Profits Method the profits of the long term insurance business comprise: i the cash transfers to the residual assets from the backing assets as determined following the statutory valuation: ii the movement over the accounting period in the present value of the expected future cash flows to the residual assets from contracts in-force at the balance sheet date and their backing assets: and iii the return on the residual assets.
Shareholder profit arises fundamentally from: i the difference between a the amounts charged to policyholders for guarantees, expenses and insurance and b the actual experience in respect of these items: and ii the investment return earned on capital.
In addition, for the United States business, the guarantees for interest credited to policyholders funds are reset periodically.
The assumed future credited interest rates are consistent with investment earnings made and in line with recent Company policy.
The treatment within these supplementary statements of all businesses other than life assurance is unchanged from the primary financial statements.
Changes in accounting policies Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the adoption of UITF Abstract 37 Purchases and Sales of Own Shares.
The abstract requires the Groups holdings of its own shares to be accounted for as a deduction in arriving at equity shareholders funds, rather than to be recorded as assets.
In addition, purchases and sales of own shares should be shown as changes in equity shareholders funds such that no profit or loss is recognised in respect of dealings in those shares.
The Group holds shares in the Company through a number of its long term business funds for the benefit of policyholders.
These shares were previously included within Other financial investments at market value.
Dividends paid have been restated to exclude any dividends in respect of own shares.
In determining the adjusted embedded value, a pro forma adjustment has been made to include the market value of own shares held in policyholders funds.
This change has resulted in an increase in operating profit after tax of 12 million R148 million 2002: 42 million R663 million representing net investment losses on own shares held in policyholders funds.
Basic earnings per share has been restated to reflect a reduction in the weighted average number of shares in issue of 316 million during 2002.
The reduction in achieved profits equity shareholders funds at 31 December 2002 as a result of the new policy was 262 million R3,618 million, made up of the original cost of the shares on demutualisation of 401 million R3,908 million and the cumulative investment loss and foreign exchange movements on the shares to the end of 2002 of 139 million R290 million.
Dividends paid have been restated to exclude dividends in respect of own shares, resulting in an increase in retained profit for the year ended 31 December 2002 of 57 million R900 million.

Annual Premium Equivalent APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10% of single premiums.
New business profitability, as measured by the ratio of the VNB to the APE, is also shown under Margin below.
The value of new business is disclosed both on a gross and after tax basis.
The assumptions and tax rates used to calculate the value of new business are set out in section 9.
Additionally, it excludes the value of the OMNIA Life Bermuda business that was acquired during 2003, and which is included within the value of new business shown in section 7.
If the value of this business 8 million: R99 million, together with the equivalent APE, had been included above, the before and after tax margins for the United States would have been 23% and 17% respectively.
Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information | 147 8VALUE OF NEW BUSINESS continued The value of new individual unit trust and some group market-linked business written by the life companies is excluded, as the profits on this business arise in the asset management subsidiaries.
The value of new business also excludes premium increases arising from indexation arrangements in respect of existing business, as these are already included in the value of in-force business.
The premiums shown for the United States exclude reinsurance ceded externally.

The pre-tax investment and economic assumptions used for South African and United States businesses were as follows: At At 31 December 31 December South Africa 2003 2002 Fixed interest return 9.4% 11.0% Equity return 11.4% 13.0% Property return 10.4% 12.0% Inflation 6.4% 7.0% Risk discount rate 11.9% 13.5% At At 31 December 31 December United States 2003 2002 Treasury yield 4.3% 4.0% Inflation 3.0% 3.0% New money yield assumed 6.0% 6.0% Net portfolio earned rate 6.4% 7.2% Risk discount rate 8.3% 8.0% For the other operations, appropriate investment and economic assumptions were chosen on bases consistent with those adopted in South Africa.
Where applicable, rates of future bonuses have been set at levels consistent with the investment return assumptions.
Projected company taxation is based on the current tax basis that applies in each country.
For the South African business full allowance has been made for STC that may be payable in South Africa.
Full account has been taken of the impact of CGT in South Africa.
It has been assumed that 10% of the equity portfolio excluding group subsidiaries will be traded each year.
For the United States business full allowance has been made for existing tax attributes of the companies, including the use of existing carry forwards and preferred tax credit investments.
Achieved profits results are initially calculated on an after tax basis and are then grossed up to the pre-tax level for presentation in the profit and loss account and the segmental analysis of results.
The tax rates used were the effective corporation tax rates of 37.8% for South African business 2002: 37.8% : 25% for United States business 2002: 30% and 0% for United Kingdom and Rest of World business 2002: 0% except for the investment return on South African capital, for which the attributed tax was derived from the primary accounts.
The assumed future mortality, morbidity and voluntary discontinuance rates have been based as far as possible on analyses of recent operating experience.
Allowance has been made where appropriate for the effect of expected AIDS-related claims.
The management expenses attributable to life assurance business have been analysed between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business and the maintenance of business in-force.
The future expenses attributable to life assurance business do not include Group holding company expenses.
Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information | 149 9ASSUMPTIONS continued No allowance has been made for future development costs.
Future investment expenses are based on the current scales of fees payable by the life assurance companies to the asset management subsidiaries.
To the extent that these fees include profit margins for the asset management subsidiaries, these margins have not been included in the value of in-force business or the value of new business.
The effect of increases in premiums over the period for policies in-force has been included in the value of in-force business only where such increases are associated with indexation arrangements.
Other increases in premiums of existing policies are included in the value of new business.
New schemes written on which recurring single premiums are expected to be received on a regular basis are treated as new business.
The annualised premium is recognised as recurring premium new business at inception of the scheme and is determined by annualising the actual premiums received during the year in question.
Subsequent recurring single premiums received in future years are not treated as new business, as these have already been provided for in calculating the value of in-force business.
The value of in-force and value of new business are sensitive to changes in various economic and non-economic assumptions.
The sensitivities of the value of in-force and value of new business to changes in key assumptions are set out in section 10.
The principal exchange rates used to translate the operating results of key foreign business segments to Sterling are: Rand US$ 2003 2002 2003 2002 Profit and loss account average rate 12.3487 15.7878 1.6354 1.5030 Balance sheet closing rate 11.9367 13.8141 1.7833 1.6105 150 | Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information ACHIEVED PROFITS BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2003 CONTINUED 10 ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS The tables below for South Africa and the United States show the sensitivity of the value of in-force at 31 December 2003 and the value of new business for the year to 31 December 2003 to changes in key assumptions.
For each sensitivity illustrated, all other assumptions have been left unchanged.
Changes have been made to certain South African sensitivity percentages in order to comply with the Actuarial Society of South Africa ASSA revised guidance note PGN 107 version 2, effective as from 31 December 2003.
The United States sensitivity percentages have also been changed to be consistent with South Africa.
