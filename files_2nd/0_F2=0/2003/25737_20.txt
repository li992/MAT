Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th June 2003 A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR ARE SET OUT BELOW.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Financial statements of investment trust companies.
Valuation of investments Quoted investments are valued at middle-market prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Board.
In making their valuations, the Board has taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to realised capital reserve, and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the unrealised capital reserve.
Year-end exchange rates are used to translate the value of investments which are denominated in foreign currencies.
Income Dividends from equity shares are included in the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Franked dividends and overseas dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits and of any tax credit on overseas income.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of withholding tax.
The fixed return on a debt security is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt security.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised through capital reserves.
Expenses, including finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: and expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment.
expenses are charged to capital reserve realised where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
The management fee and interest expenses including applicable tax relief has been allocated 50% to capital reserve realised and 50% to the revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
Performance fees payable within one year and performance fees payable in future years which relate to outperformance on capital account are charged respectively to capital reserve realised and capital reserve unrealised.
v. Borrowings interest payable Borrowings are stated at the amount of the net proceeds immediately after issue.
Issue expenses are amortised over the life of the applicable borrowing.
Interest payable on floating rate notes is recognised on an accruals basis.
Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, using the Companys effective rate of tax for the accounting period.
Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS19 Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments including equity and non-equity shares with overseas exposure.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Long-term loan facility with ING.
The interest on this facility is at a floating rate: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: Derivative transactions which the Company also enters into principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts the purpose of which is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Companys investment activities.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates both foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing these risks is summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged from the beginning of the last year to which these financial statements relate, except in relation to the use of forward currency contract to hedge US$ exposure and non-renewal interest rate swap on repayment of the floating rate notes.
42 JPMorgan Fleming Overseas Notes to the Accounts continued 19.
Financial instruments continued Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets at least quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk Where the Company financed its operations through the issued floating rate notes, the Company used an interest rate swap to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The floating rate notes were repaid during the year.
As at 30th June 2003, the Companys borrowing was at a floating rate.
Prior to this, for the year ended 30th June 2002, the Companys borrowing was at a fixed rate after taking account of an interest rate swap.
Foreign Currency Risk The Company has an exposure to foreign currency as part of the risk reward inherent from a company that invests overseas.
The income and capital value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments: Movements in rates affect short-term timing differences, and Movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company has used a forward currency contract to manage the exposure to foreign currencies.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The material accounting policies adopted in accounting for financial instruments are disclosed on page 33.
