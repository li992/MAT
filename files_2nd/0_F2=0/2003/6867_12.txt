Defined benefit scheme The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Greggs plc 1978 Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme.
The scheme funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the Companys finances.
Contributions are paid to the scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuarial adviser.
The pension cost relating to the scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the attained age method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out triennially and the latest actuarial assessment of this scheme was at 6 April 2002.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries.
It was assumed that the investment return would exceed salary increases by 2.0% per annum.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the schemes assets was 33,334,400.
The actuarial value of the schemes assets represented 87% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
In view of this situation the Company has already made several one off contributions to the scheme and has agreed to increase the funding rate, including employees contributions, to a total of 16.5% previously 13.3% of annual pensionable salary.
In addition the Company has undertaken regularly to review the funding position and intends to ensure that the scheme is adequately funded to meet its liabilities.
The total pension cost to the Group of this scheme, including the group life premium, was 2,627,000 for the year 2002: 2,400,000.
Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits the following transitional disclosures are required: The actuarial valuation was updated to 27 December 2003, by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
As required by FRS 17, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method and both the assets and liabilities include the value of those pensions in payment which are secured with insured annuities.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 27 December 28 December 29 December 2003 2002 2001 Inflation 2.7% pa 2.4% pa 2.5% pa Pension increases LPI 2.6% pa 2.4% pa 2.5% pa Salary growth 4.2% pa 3.9% pa 4.0% pa Discount rate 5.4% pa 5.6% pa 5.8% pa The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
