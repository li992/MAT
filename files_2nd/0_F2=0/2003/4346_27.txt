Owned by subsidiaries acquired 0.1 At end of year 35.1 Contingent assets liabilities and gains in respect of deferred taxation, not included in the balance sheet, were as follows: Group Company 2003 2002 2003 2002 Note m m m m Accelerated capital allowances 1.5................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ Other timing differences i 32.4 35.2 32.4 33.7 i The deferred tax assets disclosed in Note 26 in respect of overseas tax losses, relate primarily to trading losses incurred in the US and Australia and have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered more likely than not than these assets will be recovered.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset of 32.4 million above relates primarily to overseas tax losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the immediate future.
ii No deferred tax has been provided on revalued assets due to the availability of realised capital losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
iii There are additional unprovided capital losses carried forward which have not yet been agreed with the Inland Revenue.
iv The Group is able to obtain tax relief in some overseas territories for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some businesses.
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10.
Utilisation of the available tax relief in the overseas territories gives rise to a timing difference as set out above.
The potential timing differences will only reverse on sale of the relevant businesses.
As the relevant businesses are considered core to the Group there is currently no intention to dispose of them.
The potential reversal is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant.
The effect of discounting the Groups accelerated capital allowances is a credit of 4.1 million 2002 3.6 million.
The effect of discounting the Groups other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.
ii During the year, 256,000 A Ordinary Non-Voting shares were allotted for aggregate consideration of 570,530 under the terms of the Companys 1989 Executive Share Option scheme.

v In the case of the 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme, they are normally exercisable only when the relevant performance conditions have been met.

Secondly, there must be real growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years.
vi Options granted in June, July and December 1997 at respective prices of 4.070625, 4.30 and 4.7375 per share are exercisable as both performance criteria have been met.
Options granted in December 1998 at 6.475 per share vested on 26th November, 2003 when the earnings per share condition was met: the TSR condition was met in October 2001. vii The earnings per share condition was also met in the year in respect of the options granted in December 1999 at 10.295 per share, in June 2000 at 10.96 per share, in December 2000 at 8.34 per share and in July 2001 at 7.25 per share since real growth in adjusted earnings per share was achieved in the year, compared to that of three years previously.
The TSR condition has not been met so far in respect of these options.
As a consequence, none of these options has vested yet.
