FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SECTION TEN PAGE FIFTY ONE Notes to the financial statements 01 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under accounting the historical cost convention.
The particular accounting policies adopted by the directors are policies described below: i Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings using acquisition accounting.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during a financial year are included from, or up to, the effective date of acquisition or disposal.
ii Goodwill 52 Positive goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the aggregate of the fair values of that entitys identifiable assets and liabilities.
Positive goodwill relating to acquisitions is shown in the balance sheet as an asset.
On completion of each acquisition the directors estimate the useful economic life and it is over this period that the goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis.
For transactions where the primary objective is the acquisition of customer base, and where the customer relationships continue under multi-year contract arrangements, the directors believe it appropriate to ascribe useful economic lives of up to 20 years.
To date all acquisitions have been assessed by directors to have useful economic lives of 20 years.
In addition to systematic amortisation, the book value is written down to recoverable amount when any impairment is identified.
iii Profit for the financial year The Company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and has not included its own profit and loss account in these financial statements.
iv Turnover The Groups revenues are derived from the sale of software product licenses, the attendant installation, maintenance and support service revenues, supplies of third party hardware and software and the provision of PFI compliant finance facilities offered by third party funders.
All revenue is reported exclusive of value added tax and other sales tax.
In the absence of a United Kingdom accounting standard on revenue recognition, the Group believes that the best guidance is set out under US GAAP, in particular SOP 97-2 and SAB 101.
The Groups approach to revenue recognition closely mirrors US GAAP, with revenue only recognised when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists: physical delivery has occurred or services have been rendered: the price to the customer is fixed or determinable: any services deliverable under the supply arrangement are clearly separable from the software supply: and collectibility is reasonably assured and there are no material outstanding conditions or contingencies attaching to the receipt of monies due.
v Recognition of profit Turnover from the sale of software product licenses is recognised at the time the software licence is granted in accordance with agreed contractual triggers, typically the supply of the software product to the customer.
Revenues from the attendant installation, maintenance and support services are recognised proportionally over the period that the services are provided with due regard for future anticipated costs.
Payments received in advance of services are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred income.
SECTION TEN PAGE FIFTY TWO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements vi Research and development 01 accounting Research and development costs are fully written off in the year in which they are incurred.
policies cont... vii Depreciation Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of tangible assets over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
The annual rates of depreciation, by category of fixed asset, are as follows: office equipment, fixtures and fittings 12.5% to 20.0% computer equipment 33.3% motor vehicles 25.0% 53 viii Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These transaction differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Results of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate on the year end date and any resulting exchange differences taken to reserves.
ix Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, where the timing differences result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Timing differences arise because of differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Where law or accounting standards require gains and losses to be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, the related taxation is also taken directly to the statement of total recognised gains and losses in due course.
x Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet and depreciated in accordance with the Groups normal accounting policy for the class of asset concerned.
The present value of future rentals is shown as a liability.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.
xi Pensions All employees are eligible to join the iSOFT Group Personal Pension Scheme or other Group approved defined contribution pension schemes.
The pension charge shown in the financial statements represents the total contributions payable by the Group for the year.
