18 Treasury The groups treasury operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
Yule Catto & Co plcs policy is to finance itself using a mixture of equity and debt instruments.
The groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the groups operations and its sources of finance.
As permitted by FRS13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than net currency disclosures.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity risk The objective of the company is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Yule Catto & Co plc had the following principal facilities: A committed 120 million syndicated bank facility, which comprise a term loan of 60 million for medium term requirements, repayable in tranches and a revolving credit facility of 60 million which expires in November 2006.
Unsecured loan notes totalling just over 100 million raised primarily from the US private placement market.
With maturity between 2008 and 2010, this provides the groups long term requirements.
50 51 Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report 2003 18 Treasury continued Foreign currency risk The group uses currency borrowings and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2002 none.
Interest rate risk profile Financial assets The group has no financial assets, other than short-term debtors and cash at bank 2002 none.
Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the group as at 31 December 2003 was: Weighted Floating Weighted average time Total rate Fixed rate average fixed for which borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate rate is fixed 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 000 000 000 % years Sterling 139,180 10,820 150,000 6.8 4.7 Euro currencies 36,632 2,874 33,758 5.1 1.5 Other 11,320 11,320 187,132 3,374 183,758 6.6 4.1 Weighted Floating Weighted average time Total rate Fixed rate average fixed for which 2002 2002 2002 2002 2002 000 000 000 % years Sterling 199,342 14,342 185,000 6.7 4.6 Euro currencies 10,292 20,966 31,258 5.1 2.5 Other 8,110 8,110 217,744 1,486 216,258 6.6 4.3 The floating rate borrowings comprise: sterling denominated bank borrowings that bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
sterling denominated overdrafts that bear interest at rates based on the UK bank rate.
foreign currency predominantly euros denominated bank borrowings and overdrafts that bear interest at equivalent rates.
2003 2002 000 000 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 was as follows: In one year or less on demand 34,271 57,527 In more than one year but not more than two years 13,407 419 In more than two years but not more than five years 72,701 59,729 In more than five years 66,753 100,069 187,132 217,744 Borrowing facilities The group has various undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
The facilities available at 31 December 2003 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met were as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Expiring in one year or less Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 30,000 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 60,000 25,000 60,000 55,000 In addition to the committed facilities, the group has 60.9m 2002 18.7m of undrawn overdraft facilities.
Notes to the Financial Statements 31 December 2003 continued 18 Treasury continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the groups financial assets and liabilities.
The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the loans of 9,297,000, 2002 1,115,000 reflects the revaluation of the Private Placement loan notes.
The loan notes are hedged using currency swaps and the carrying value and fair value of the currency element of these differ by an equal and opposite amount.
Gains and losses on hedges There are no unrecognised gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2003 2002: none.
The interest rate and currency swaps in place are an integral part of the groups interest rate hedging strategy and as such there is no intention to cancel these contracts before maturity.
In the hypothetical event that the contracts had been cancelled at 31 December 2003, the net compensation payable would have been 4,283,000 2002 net compensation receivable 5,484,000.
During the year the effect of the hedging undertaken has been a debit of 791,000 2002 credit of 348,000 to the groups profit and loss account.
The hedging undertaken ensures that a substantial proportion of the groups interest charge for 2004 and beyond is known with certainty.
Should variable rates remain constant, the debit to the profit and loss account in 2004 in respect of the groups obligations under hedging contracts will be 1,170,000.
If variable interest rates increase, the debit to the profit and loss account in 2004 in respect of the groups obligations under the hedging contracts will increase accordingly.

31 Pension commitments The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
UK pension schemes The group participates in a funded Scheme with both a defined benefit and defined contribution section the Yule Catto Group Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The Schemes defined benefit section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December 1998 and with effect from 1 January 1999 a defined contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible group employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives within the group.
Contributions to the defined benefit scheme are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation was at 6 April 2003.
The assumptions, which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation, are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increases in salaries and pensions.
For non-retired members it was assumed the investment return would be 7.5% pa and that salaries would increase at 3.5% pa. For retired members it was assumed that the investment return would be 5.75% pa, and for all members it was assumed that all pensions for which increases were due would increase at the rate of 2.5% pa, or such higher amount as guaranteed by the Scheme Rules.
Assets were taken into account at market value.
At the date of the actuarial valuation the market value of the assets of the UK Scheme was 102,574,435.
On the basis described above, the assets attributable to accrued defined benefits were assessed as being sufficient to cover 61.2% of the value of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following an improvement in the funding position since the valuation, and in line with the recommendations from the Scheme actuary, annual contributions to the main UK Scheme have increased to 36.7% with effect from 1 October 2003.
