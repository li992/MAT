x NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the principal accounting policies, which are unchanged from last year and have been applied consistently, is set out below.
a BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued in 1995. b INVESTMENTS Listed investments are shown at middle market value, or in the case of FTSE 100 constituents, at last traded prices issued by the London Stock Exchange.
Listed investments include Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs authorised in the UK: these are valued at mid price and are classified for valuation purposes according to the principal geographical area of the underlying holdings.
Unlisted investments are shown at a valuation determined by the Directors based upon latest dealing prices, stockbroker valuations, net asset values and other information, as appropriate.
c INCOME i Income from equity investments is brought into account on the date on which the investments are quoted ex-dividend or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
ii Interest from fixed interest securities is recognised on an accruals basis.
Fixed interest securities issued at a significant discount or premium are accounted for on an effective yield basis.
iii Unfranked investment income includes the taxes deducted at source.
iv Franked investment income is stated net of tax credits.
v Interest receivable on deposits is recognised on an accruals basis.
vi If scrip is taken in lieu of dividends in cash, the net amount of the cash dividend declared is credited to the revenue account.
d EXPENSES All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged through the revenue account except where they relate directly to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case they are added to the cost of the investment or deducted from the sale proceeds.
e LONG TERM BORROWINGS AND FINANCE COSTS Long term borrowings are carried in the balance sheet at the cumulative amount of net proceeds after issue, plus accrued finance costs.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to the revenue account at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Issue costs are written off at a constant rate over the life of the borrowings.
f TAXATION Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, calculated at the current tax rate relevant to the benefit or liability.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which underlying timing differences can be deducted.
g FOREIGN CURRENCIES Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the time of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in capital reserve or revenue reserve as appropriate.
h CAPITAL RESERVES Realised: Gains and losses on realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are dealt with in this reserve.
Purchases of the Companys own shares for cancellation are also funded from this reserve.
Unrealised: Unrealised appreciation represents the amount by which the market value of assets and liabilities differs from their book value and is dealt with in this reserve.

Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2003 of 143.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 12.0% as against 14.6% on a traditional basis.
At 30 April 2002 the effect would have been to reduce net asset value per ordinary share from 221.5p to 217.9p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2002 of 195.3p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 10.4% as against 11.8%.
Gains and losses on hedges At 30 April 2003 there were no unrecognised gains losses on hedges.
Realised currency gains losses are taken to the capital reserve and are not reflected in the revenue account unless they are of a revenue nature.

No further shares were bought back and therefore at 30 April 2003 the Companys authority to buy back its own shares remained unchanged at 44,123,858 ordinary shares.
Under the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association share buy-backs are funded from the realised capital reserve.
The nominal value of the share capital is maintained through a transfer of reserves to the capital redemption reserve.

25 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company operates as an investment trust in accordance with section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The international nature of the Companys investment activities provides opportunities for both market appreciation and currency gains, but leaves it exposed to the risk of market volatility and currency fluctuations.
In the case of an investment trust, capital profits from investing activities and currency gains are not recognised in the revenue account, but are credited directly to a separate capital reserve which the Company is prohibited from distributing in the form of dividends.
The Company makes use of gearing long and short term borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The Companys revenue account may be affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates: income from overseas investment can be affected by currency fluctuations.
The Companys financial instruments, which provide finance for investment activities, currently comprise its debenture stocks, its short term borrowings, and its cash and liquid resources.
In addition to the equity portfolio, the Company maintains investments in UK and overseas corporate bonds as part of its investment strategy.
The Company may, from time to time, enter into derivative transactions to hedge specific currency or interest rate risk.
No such transactions were undertaken in the period under review.
The Company has precisely defined guidelines to govern the purchase or writing of options on individual shares.
No options were purchased or written in the year under review.
Trading in financial instruments is not within the normal activities of an investment trust, nor is it the Companys policy to trade in such instruments.
Transactions in financial instruments generally arise as a result of strategic investment decisions.
The Companys Managers may not enter into derivative transactions without the prior approval of the Board, and all borrowing facilities require Board authorisation.
The Board agrees policies for managing risk with the Companys Managers.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market risk as noted above, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its operations by means of equity shareholders funds, bank borrowings and the issue of debenture stocks.
The value of the Companys bond portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk.
The Company has negotiated short term multi-currency borrowing facilities at interest rates linked to LIBOR and may draw down funds for a period of up to 12 months see note 12.
In addition the Company maintains a 5 million undrawn overdraft facility with The Bank of New York.
The Company has issued fixed interest debenture stocks.
Credit Risk In addition to interest rate risk, the Companys investments in bonds are also subject to credit risk.
Credit risk reflects the possibility that a borrower will not be able to meet its obligation to make payments of interest or principal when they fall due.
The Managers analyse the credit risk of the Companys bond investments prior to purchase and continue to monitor developments in credit quality subsequently.
Liquidity Risk The Companys policy with regard to liquidity is to ensure continuity of funding.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities which can be sold freely to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Foreign Currency Risk The international nature of the Companys investment activities gives rise to a currency risk which is inherent in the performance of its overseas investments.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis, but the Company may from time to time match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
