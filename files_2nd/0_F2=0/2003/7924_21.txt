Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year Pre-goodwill amortisation, the tax assessed for the year at 27.1% is lower than the standard higher rate of corporation tax in the UK 30.0%.
Post-goodwill amortisation, the effective tax rate exceeded 30.0%.
A reconciliation between the current tax charge at the standard UK rate and the actual current tax charge is shown below: In s million 2003 2002 2001 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 656 423 494 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in 197 127 148 the UK of 30.0% 2002: 30.0%: 2001: 30.0% Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 8 12 Non-deductible goodwill 61 25 2 Lower tax rates on overseas earnings 33 12 8 Current deferred tax 4 27 4 Other 1 1 5 Total current tax 236 167 135 Factors that may affect future tax charges No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided is 6m and it is not envisaged that this tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, as no dividends have been declared.
The Group currently does not have any intention to remit dividends from overseas subsidiaries to the UK but if it were to do so, the tax effect would be immaterial.

It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions, and is subject to policies and procedures approved by the Board.
On a frequent basis, the Group Treasurer discusses matters with a treasury subcommittee, consisting of senior executives, including the Finance Director.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including provision of monthly treasury summaries and an annual review of strategy.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date: In s million 2003 2002 Amounts falling due within one year Bank loans and overdrafts 106 57 Other loans 499 36 605 93 Amounts falling due after more than one year Bank loans between one and two years 2 2 Other loans between one and two years 635 456 Bank loans between two and five years 287 339 Other loans between two and five years 1,748 2,133 Other loans after five years 755 715 3,427 3,645 Total borrowings 4,032 3,738 Loans amounting to 8m 2002: 9m are secured by charges, mortgages or liens on certain fixed assets.
In addition to the bank loans maturing between two and five years, there are b610m of bank guarantees issued to support the future purchase of 9.99% of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH.
The loans maturing after five years are the US $600m global bond which matures in April 2009, and the 350m sterling bond which matures in June 2012. i Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings and surplus cash.
In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group maintains both fixed and floating rate debt and uses derivatives, including interest rate and cross currency swaps, to vary the mix.
The following table analyses the currency and interest composition of the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The majority of bank borrowings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of one month by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling borrowings and EURIBOR in the case of euro borrowings.
The capital market issuance in place at the year end bears interest post interest and currency swaps at rates fixed in advance for six months by reference to LIBOR in the case of the US dollar bond, for three months by reference to EURIBOR in the case of the sterling bond and some of the euro bonds and for three months by reference to Australian dollar bank bills in the case of one of the euro bonds.
The figures shown in the tables above take into account various interest rate and currency swaps.
Hence the US dollar denominated bond issued in 1999 is shown within the sterling balance, and the sterling bond issued in 2002 is shown in the euro balance.
The fixed rate financial liabilities do not take into account forward start swaps, which may become effective after the balance sheet date.
ii Currency risk disclosure The Group is exposed to the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries into sterling, as well as the impact of trading transactions in foreign currencies.
On significant acquisitions of overseas companies, borrowings are raised in the local currency to minimise the translation risk.
For transaction risk, where necessary, forward foreign exchange deals are entered into to hedge a proportion of the forecast foreign currency cash flows.
At the year end, 47.7m notional of forward foreign exchange deals were outstanding 2002: 32.6m.

The additional amounts provided in the year relate primarily to termination of employment.
The balance of the provision will mainly be utilised by the end of 2004.
Unfunded pension obligations relate to pension schemes in Germany.
The Groups main pension schemes are held in separately administered funds and are described in note 23.
Other provisions principally relate to a long-term marketing contract which will be utilised by October 2006.
The price at which options may be offered is up to 20% less than the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to the invitation.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the expiry of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the Scheme.
International Sharesave Plan Under the Plan the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs in the Company to nonUK employees who enter into a savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered varies depending on local laws, but for ordinary shares will not be less than 80% of the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation.
In respect of ADSs the price will not be less than 80% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the same day.
Options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after entering the Plan.
Long-Term Incentive Plan In respect of the performance period ending in December 2002, the Companys total shareholder return exceeded that of all the companies in the FTSE 100 Index.
By exceeding the bottom 80 per cent of the companies in the Index, the award vested in full on 6 January 2003.
In respect of the November 2000 November 2003 award, based on earnings per share to the end of the financial year, 100% of the award will vest, on 27 November 2003.
Share Matching Scheme The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
There was an initiative in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited.
All employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided these shares are left in the Trusts, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20% for one years retention to a maximum of 100% if they are retained for five years.
For Executive Directors and selected management, individuals may elect to invest any proportion up to a maximum of 100% of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided that the shares elected for are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment with the Group, the participant would receive the original shares plus additional shares.
The matching ratio for bonuses is 1:1 to encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding in the Group.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust have been established to acquire ordinary shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related share awards.
At 30 September 2003, the Trusts held 5.5m 2002: 3.9m ordinary shares, with a nominal value of 552,042, all acquired in the open market at a cost of 49.1m 2002: 26.7m.
These were financed by a gift of 1.7m and an interest free loan of 47.4m.
None of the ESOT shares have been allocated to employees or Directors as at 30 September 2003.
All finance costs and administration expenses connected with the ESOTs are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
The cost of the shares is being amortised over the performance period of the associated schemes.
The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.

Included in other net exchange movements are exchange losses of 338m 2002: 36m arising on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies designated as hedges of foreign net investments.
During 2002 the Group acquired a 90.01% interest in Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and entered into an Option Agreement enabling the acquisition of the outstanding 9.99%.
The Group also entered into a Profit Pooling Agreement whereby the holders of the outstanding 9.99% surrendered their interests in the equity and results of Reemtsma in exchange for a fixed return.
As a result the Group has consolidated 100% of the results and net assets of Reemtsma and have reflected a liability to the holders of the 9.99%.
The acquisition method has been adopted.
Provisional fair valuations included in the 2002 Group financial statements have, in accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting, been finalised resulting in a decrease in net assets acquired of 47m, and a corresponding increase in purchased goodwill which has been incorporated into the 2003 Group financial statements.
The principal adjustments have been a 57m reduction on plant and machinery following completion of a comprehensive review of the assets acquired, together with a 19m decrease in associated deferred taxation liability.

In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
23 Pensions The Group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally those operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited, John Player & Sons Limited, Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and Badische Tabakmanufaktur Roth-Hndle GmbH BTM.
The main schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets are held in trustee administered funds, apart from the German schemes which are unfunded.
The principal Group scheme, covering UK employees, is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Scheme.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was made at 31 March 2001.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Schemes liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return earned on the Schemes existing assets and the rates of increase in pay and pensions.
It was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.25% and 2.5% per annum respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2001, the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 2,439m.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 111% of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
Group contributions to the Scheme remain suspended having regard to the surplus disclosed in this valuation.
There was no pension cost to disclose in respect of the Scheme for the year ended 30 September 2003.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Watson Wyatt LLP, actuaries and consultants, using the projected unit method.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date.
Since the date of the last formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme, stock markets have fallen significantly, impacting the valuation of the assets of the Scheme.
The pension cost will be reassessed following the next formal valuation as at 31 March 2004.
This valuation is not expected to have a material effect on the future profits of the Group.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of the Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and BTM pension schemes were undertaken at 28 September 2002 and 30 September 2003.
These quantified unfunded past service liabilities of 291m at 28 September 2002 and 337m at 30 September 2003, which has been recognised in the accounts, together with the other German unfunded schemes.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Schemes liabilities were those relating to the rates of increase in pay and pensions.
These would be in the range of 2.8% to 2.9% for the increase in pay and 1.5% to 1.6% for the increase in pensions.
The pension cost relating to foreign schemes is calculated in accordance with local accounting principles.
The pension cost for foreign schemes in the year was 34m 2002: 13m.

ITG 90 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued i Pensions Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for under the rules set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with those set out in the US accounting standard for pensions, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87.
However, SSAP 24 is less prescriptive in the application of the actuarial method and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension costs.
Group contributions to the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Scheme are suspended as a result of the surplus disclosed in note 23.
Under UK GAAP, in accordance with SSAP 24, no pension expense has been reflected in the profit and loss account and no pension asset has been recognised in the balance sheet for the UK and Irish pension schemes.
A pension liability and related pension expense is recognised for the German unfunded pension schemes, in accordance with SSAP 24.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with SFAS 87.
Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Scheme assets over benefit obligations has been recognised in the balance sheet.
ii Intangible assets Both UK and US GAAP require purchase consideration to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made on, or after, 27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years.
Prior to 27 September 1998, all goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
Under US GAAP, identifiable intangible assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives.
The separately identifiable intangible assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights which are being amortised over 25 to 30 years.
The Company adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets with effect from 1 July 2001 and accordingly goodwill generated on acquisitions after this date was not amortised.
For purchase transactions prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its useful life.
From 29 September 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortises goodwill but rather tests such assets for impairment on an annual basis or where there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company has completed the first step of the impairment test under the transitional requirements of SFAS 142 and an annual impairment review as of 30 September 2003.
No impairment charge of goodwill was indicated.
A reconciliation of previously reported net income under US GAAP and income per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortisation is presented below.
Income per ordinary share adjusted for goodwill charges is calculated by adding back the goodwill charge to net income and dividing by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for all periods presented.

Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
US GAAP requires deferred taxation to be provided in full, using the liability method.
In addition, US GAAP requires the recognition of the deferred tax consequences of differences between the assigned values and the tax bases of the identifiable intangible assets, with the exception of non tax-deductible goodwill, in a purchase business combination.
Consequently, the deferred tax liability attributable to identifiable intangible assets has been recognised and is being amortised over the useful economic lives of the underlying intangible assets.
iv Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being hedged, in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures.
Under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments that reduce exposures on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge accounting.
US GAAP requires the Group to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Group has decided not to satisfy the SFAS 133 requirements to achieve hedge accounting for its derivatives, where permitted, and accordingly movements in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the profit and loss account.
v Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends paid and proposed are shown on the face of the profit and loss account as an appropriation of the current years earnings.
Proposed dividends are provided on the basis of recommendation by the Directors and are subject to subsequent approval by shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.
vi Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs Under UK GAAP, shares held by the Trusts are recorded at cost and reflected as a fixed asset investment in the Groups balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, these shares are recorded at cost and reflected as a deduction from shareholders funds.
vii Employee share schemes charge to the profit and loss account Under UK GAAP, the cost of shares purchased by the ESOTs in conjunction with an employee share scheme are charged to the profit and loss account according to the book value of the shares at the date of purchase.
The cost of employee share schemes not held under the ESOTs are charged using the quoted market price of shares at the date of grant.
The charge is accrued over the vesting period of the shares in both cases.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
For option plans which contain performance criteria, compensation cost is remeasured at each period end until all performance criteria have been met.
viii Inventory step-up On acquisition under UK GAAP, the fair value of inventory is represented by the acquired companies current cost of reproducing that inventory.
On acquisition under US GAAP, the fair value represents the selling price less any further costs to be incurred to sale.
ITG 92 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued ix Restructuring costs On acquisition under UK GAAP, restructuring provisions may only be recognised as a fair value adjustment, if the acquired company had an irrevocable commitment to restructure which was not conditional on the completion of the purchase.
On acquisition under US GAAP, restructuring liabilities relating solely to the acquired entity may be provided in the opening balance as a fair value exercise, if specific criteria about restructuring plans are met.
x Net income per share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in accordance with SFAS 128.

There are certain differences between FRS 1 revised and SFAS 95 with regard to classification of items within the cash flow statement.
In accordance with FRS 1 revised, cash flows are prepared separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and financing.
Under SFAS 95, cash flows are classified under operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under FRS 1 revised, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Under SFAS 95, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
A summary of the Groups cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities classified in accordance with SFAS 95 is presented below.
For the purposes of this summary, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under SFAS 133.
This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after 30 June 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after 30 June 2003.
The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys results.
In May 2003, the FASB issues SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
SFAS 150 establishes standards on how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
It requires that a company classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances.
Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity.
This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after 31 May 2003 and otherwise is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after 15 December 2003.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No.
46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
46 requires certain variable interest entities, or VIEs, to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
46 is effective for all VIEs created or acquired after 31 January 2003.
For VIEs created or acquired prior to 1 February 2003, the provisions of FIN No.
46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after 15 December 2003.
The Group currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and, therefore, the Group does not expect the adoption of FIN No.
46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
