Abbey also has some transactional or non-structural currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from the activities of Abbey where the operating unit undertakes activities in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Where such activities show currency mismatches between assets and liabilities, Abbey uses a variety of derivative products to eliminate some or all of the currency risk depending on the amount and nature of the transaction.
Controls are in place to limit the size of Abbeys open transactional foreign exchange positions.
Certain transactional currency exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses which are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of Abbey that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations as shown in the above table.

These losses are considered temporary as Abbey has the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity and Abbey is satisfied that there has been no credit deterioration, particularly as to date Abbey has suffered no defaults on this type of issuer.
The unrealised losses arise from changes in interest rates.
This is evidenced by the fact that the related derivative hedges, which as they are with Financial Products, do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, have an equal and opposite fair value surplus.

During 2003, Abbeys significant exposures to credit risk arose mainly in the residential mortgage portfolio and unsecured lending in Banking and Savings and in Treasury Services and Wholesale Banking.
See Risk management Credit risk for additional information regarding Abbeys approach to managing credit risk.
Residential mortgages represented 42% 2002: 34% of total assets at 31 December 2003: 98% 2002: 95% of the residential mortgage asset is located in the UK.
Although the Treasury Services operations are based mainly in the UK, it has built up exposures to various entities around the world.
At 31 December 2003, 18% of Treasury Services credit exposures were to counterparties from the United States, and 50% were to counterparties from the UK.
The remaining exposures were mainly to counterparties from Europe.
Less than 3% of Treasury Services exposures were to countries that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Fair values of financial instruments The following disclosures are made in accordance with SFAS 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
The fair values have been estimated using quoted market prices where available.
Where no ready markets exist and hence quoted market prices are not available, appropriate techniques are used to estimate fair values which typically take account of the characteristics of the instruments, including the future cash ows, market interest rates and prices available for similar instruments.
Unless otherwise specified, fair values of financial instruments have been estimated by discounting anticipated future cash ows using market interest rates offered at 31 December 2003 for similar instruments.
By its nature, the estimation of fair values is highly subjective and the results will depend largely upon the assumptions made.
See Operating review highlights Critical accounting policies for additional information.
Considerable caution should therefore be used in interpreting the fair values and particularly if comparing with fair values presented by other financial institutions.
The concept of fair values assumes that the financial instruments will be realised by way of sale in the ordinary course of business with adjustments made for liquidity as appropriate.
SFAS 107 does not apply to non financial assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, tangible xed assets and balances relating to Long Term Assurance business are excluded.
The carrying values and estimated fair values of financial instruments are as follows: 182 Abbey Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Audited Financial Statements Audited Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 Carrying Fair Surplus Carrying Fair Surplus 1 1 amount value deficit amount value deficit m m m m m m Non-trading assets Cash and balances at central banks 439 439 396 396 Loans and advances to banks 2,271 2,271 3,127 3,129 2 Related derivatives 26 27 1 17 17 34 Loans and advances to customers 84,426 84,688 262 87,314 87,508 194 Related derivatives 588 1,061 474 244 1,109 865 Debt securities 1,753 1,841 88 32,975 33,104 129 Related derivatives 58 199 140 222 992 7 70 Equity shares and other variable yield securities 394 394 893 901 8 Non-trading liabilities Deposits by banks 8,772 8,793 20 11,481 11,515 34 Related derivatives 67 52 15 36 12 48 Customer accounts 68,666 68,882 217 67,934 68,120 186 Related derivatives 47 187 140 176 307 131 Debt securities in issue 24,834 24,893 59 48,079 48,340 261 Related derivatives 80 259 179 205 542 337 Short positions in debt securities and equity shares 106 109 3 Subordinated liabilities including convertible debt 6,337 7,068 731 6,532 7,217 685 Related derivatives 99 425 524 98 790 692 Other long term capital instruments 742 896 154 7 71 807 36 Related derivatives 1 208 207 637 31 2 Other non-trading derivatives 10 5 15 645 39 Trading assets liabilities Treasury bills & other eligible bills 1,630 1,630 1,483 1,483 Loans and advances to banks 4,884 4,884 3,474 3,474 Loans and advances to customers 9,413 9,413 3,289 3,289 Debt securities 28,575 28,575 26,832 26,832 Equity shares and other variable yield securities 1,239 1,239 70 70 Deposits by banks 13,353 13,353 12,693 12,693 Customer accounts 5,736 5,736 8,832 8,832 Short positions in government debt securities 4,303 4,303 3,350 3,350 Derivative contracts with third parties 3,169 3,169 1,757 1,757 Derivative contracts with ANFP 50 50 132 132 1 Where quoted market prices are not available, fair values of on-balance sheet financial instruments incorporate the discounted value of the principal amounts, whereas, for associated hedges of the underlying interest ows, fair values of derivatives do not reect principal amounts.

In other cases, market values have been determined instruments for which fair values have been estimated under SFAS 107. using in-house pricing models, or stated at amortised cost.
The approach to specic categories of financial instruments is described below.

Depending on the product type and its components, the fair value of over-the-counter Off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments derivatives is modelled using one or a combination of pricing models Abbey uses various market-related off-balance sheet financial that are widely accepted in the financial services industry.
The fair value of these instruments is measured as the Pricing models take into account the contract terms of the sum of positive and negative fair values at the balance sheet date, securities as well as market-based valuation parameters, such as which is estimated using market prices where available or pricing interest rates, volatility, exchange rates and the credit rating of the models consistent with standard market practice.
Valuation adjustments are an integral component of the fair value estimation process and are taken on individual positions 65.

Certain of the loans secured on residential properties are at a xed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years from their commencement.
At the end of this period these loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
