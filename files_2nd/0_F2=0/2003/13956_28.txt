We have had to sharpen existing skills and develop others that will be of lasting value.
The Charles Miller Smith Chairman California energy crisis that followed so soon after our merger with PaciCorp has given us 7 May 2003 a heightened awareness of risk and better techniques for managing it.
We are now excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items Charles Miller Smith, Chairman ScottishPower annual review 2002 03 01 Chief Executives Review This has been a year of delivery based on our consistent focus on performance.
I am pleased to report that in the past year we delivered a good set of results, with profits up substantially and earnings per share for the year up 29%.
The recovery at PaciCorp was particularly pleasing, with operating profit up by some 60% in the year.
Our dividend for the year was 28.71 pence per share an increase of 5%.
We also delivered a total return of 13.9% for shareholders during the year.
The sale of Southern Water at the beginning of the year enabled us to reduce our net debt by 2 billion, thus strengthening our balance sheet and financial ratios.
We manage regulated and competitive businesses in the UK and US to serve gas and electricity customers.
We invested over 800 million in our businesses during the year, of which some 345 million 42% was in areas of growth, such as additions to our electricity networks, new generation especially renewables, and gas storage.
Investment of this sort is at the heart of our strategy to become a leading international energy company.
We invest only in businesses where we can deploy proven skills and strong market knowledge.
The safety and well-being of our workforce and the public is our number one priority.
Sadly the year saw two of our colleagues killed at work: one fatal accident in the UK and one in the US.
Tragedies such as these reinforce my conviction that we should put nothing ahead of safety and that we all have a role and responsibility to ensure that the highest standards are maintained at all times.
During the past year we have made good progress in further enhancing the underlying quality of our business.
As Business in the Communitys Company of the Year 2002 we have continued to contribute signicantly to the Corporate Social Responsibility agenda in both the UK and the US and are publishing our first combined Environmental and Social Impact Report in July 2003.
Our robust risk management policies and procedures were recognised by the international finance magazine, Risk, with the prestigious award of Corporate Risk Manager of the Year.
We have also placed great emphasis on the talent and performance management of our people: our top international cadre of 250 managers now has clear incentive based performance agreements linked directly to our strategic objectives.
PACIFICORP PaciCorp is our regulated US business, with a portfolio of over 8,000 MW of power from coal, gas, renewable and hydro resources, 15,000 miles of transmission lines and a distribution system serving 1.5 million customers in six states.
PaciCorp is a leading regional integrated utility and is a key player in western energy markets.
The strategic priorities of PaciCorp set at the beginning of 2002 03 were: Achieve ROE target $1 billion EBIT by 2004 05 through: General rate cases Transition Plan Manage risk and reward balance Deliver excellent customer service Operating profit for PaciCorp increased by 233 million to 463 million for the year to 31 March 2003.
Operating profit excluding goodwill amortisation for PaciCorp for the year grew by 225 million to 597 million, as a result of regulatory rate increases and recoveries of excess power costs of 80 million, signicantly lower net power costs of 257 million and continued progress in the delivery of Transition Plan benets of 64 million in the year.
These improvements were partly offset by lower transmission revenues of 19 million from reduced Ian Russell, Chief Executive excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items excluding goodwill amortisation Excerpt from our Preliminary Results presentation, May 2002 use of the transmission system by third parties, higher depreciation charges of 25 million, risk mitigation and project costs of 41 million, insurance, pensions, and healthcare costs of 46 million and one-off gains in the previous year and foreign exchange of 45 million.
Net capital expenditure for the year decreased by 1 million to 368 million, with 111 million invested in network growth and new generation assets, 211 million on network and generation refurbishment, and 46 million on other capital projects including information technology.
Net capital expenditure is expected to increase in 2003 04 as a result of higher generation and mining overhauls and refurbishment spend, environmental initiatives and continued investment in expanding the network.
All expenditure prudently incurred is expected to earn its regulatory rate of return, and contribute to an increased rate base for PaciCorp.
Achieve ROE target $1 billion EBIT by 2004 05 through: General rate cases Transition Plan PaciCorp remains on track towards its target of $1 billion EBIT by 2004 05 through a combination of general rate cases and benets derived from the Transition Plan.
The outlook for ScottishPower remains positive.
General rate increases of approximately $160 million per year have been awarded to PaciCorp from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2003, with $31 million awarded during the year ended 31 March 2003.
PaciCorps regulatory strategy includes ling regular rate cases to increase revenues to recover increasing operational costs and capital expenditure, while realising our full allowed return on investment.
In line with this plan, PaciCorp led a general rate case in Oregon in March 2003, for $58 million, representing a 7% rate increase, primarily as a result of 39.7 99 increased costs related to insurance premiums, healthcare, pensions and other costs that are similarly affecting many other US companies.
In California, testimony and hearings in 38.0 00 PaciCorps $16 million general rate case request have been scheduled to take place through May and June of 2003.
PaciCorp also plans to le in the next few weeks for general rate cases 27.9 01 in Wyoming and Utah.
26.1 During March 2003, PaciCorp was denied recovery of $91 million in net excess power costs in 02 Wyoming and is currently seeking a re-hearing of this decision.
Additionally, PaciCorp 33.7 continues seeking to defer and recover approximately $16 million in net excess power costs in 03 Washington state.
An order on this case is expected by early summer 2003.
Earnings per share pence Excluding goodwill amortisation Among the legislative measures approved in PaciCorps service territory, Senate Bill 61 in Utah and exceptional items will go into effect in early summer 2003.
This legislation provides an option for the Utah Public ScottishPower annual review 2002 03 02 03 PaciCorps distribution and transmission areas cover 135,192 sq miles.

Service Commission to use a future test-year period in utility rate cases that more appropriately reects the cost of providing service, which is necessary to reduce the period between capital investment and recovery in rates referred to as regulatory lag.
Reducing regulatory lag should encourage needed, cost-effective investments in utility infrastructure by companies such as PaciCorp.
The PaciCorp Transition Plan continues to progress on track as a key driver towards increasing profitability and supporting PaciCorps regulatory objectives.
Cumulative Transition Plan benets total approximately $217 million, slightly ahead of this years target of $204 million and we are now two-thirds of the way towards our goal of $300 million by 2004 05.
These included new call centre technology and other process changes that helped increase employee productivity and improve customer service.
In distribution, operational efficiency improvements were delivered such as Home Start, which allows overhead line crews to respond more effectively to faults.
Additionally, continuing procurement cost savings and royalties from the sale of a synthetic fuel operation last year contributed to PaciCorps continued delivery of the Transition Plan in 2002 03.
Copyright The Times business 4 October 2002 Manage risk and reward balance PaciCorp successfully managed power demand during the challenging summer of 2002 and winter of 2002 03 through a robust combination of existing physical resources, a weatherrelated hedge and peaking generation facilities.
During the winter, PaciCorps base of coal-red generating resources and forward gas purchase strategy minimised the risks of natural gas price volatility.
PaciCorp remains well-positioned and is fundamentally balanced for the summer of 2003.
Our long-term Integrated Resource Plan IRP, which seeks to identify new resource requirements to implement plans to deliver safe, reliable low-cost power to customers over the next 20 years, was led with state regulatory commissions in January 2003.
The IRP is progressing with the development of the Request for Proposals RFP process, under which PaciCorp will seek bids for future generation needs.
RFPs will be issued for both shortand long-term electricity requirements, including renewable energy needs.
The RFP process is expected to extend until spring 2004.
The IRP and the resulting RFP process have been created to identify PaciCorps future resource mix in a coordinated process with the six states in which PaciCorp operates.
As part of these processes, PaciCorp is expecting to add the equivalent of approximately 4,000 MW of capacity through a combination of sources over the next decade.
These include the addition of base load construction capacity or purchases approximately 2,100 MW, peaking resources approximately 1,200 MW and purchased shaped power approximately 700 MW.
In addition, PaciCorp also plans to implement demand side management programmes up to 450 MW on average and acquire renewable energy approximately 1,400 MW.
Among the steps involved in the IRP process will be an evaluation of potential future generation sources such as an additional generating unit at the Hunter station in Utah.
The air quality permitting process has begun to enable PaciCorp to develop this option.
Prudently incurred costs of such investments are expected to be included in PaciCorps future rate base.
ScottishPower annual review 2002 03 04 05 Chief Executives Review continued Deliver excellent customer service During 2002 03, PaciCorp continued to enhance its customer service commitments, while maintaining retail rates that are among the lowest in the western US.
Improvements include enhancing PaciCorps outage communications technology to provide customers with the ability to report outages directly, thus helping to speed repairs or pinpoint potential problem areas.
PaciCorp was recognised by TQS Research of Atlanta, Georgia, for improvements with large commercial and industrial customers.
Overall customer satisfaction metrics show positive results, including improved accuracy and timeliness of customer billing.
In addition, PaciCorp successfully tested a handheld meter reading system that will improve system functionality and accuracy.
The new system is expected to be implemented by the summer of 2003, with further productivity improvements to follow over the next 12 months that will enhance PaciCorps scheduling technology.
PaciCorps green pricing programme is one of the most progressive and successful in the US.
PaciCorp is expecting to add the equivalent of 4,000 MW approximately of capacity through a combination of sources.
ScottishPower share price outperformed the FTSE 100 index of companies by 52.6%.
calculated for the period 29 03 02 31 03 03 Based on a recent report, PaciCorp was rated third in the US by the Department of Energy as a marketer of green energy under PaciCorps Blue Sky programme.
In excess of 21,000 customers have signed up for Blue Sky or other renewable products.
To improve customer service and reliability, PaciCorp continues its infrastructure improvement projects in targeted areas, particularly along Utahs Wasatch Front where there is rapidly growing demand for electricity.
The scope of this $200 million investment through 2005 includes transmission line upgrades, new distribution substations, upgrades to existing distribution substations and other system enhancements.
These projects will provide additional capacity to meet future load demands throughout PaciCorps network, especially in highgrowth areas.
INFRASTRUCTURE DIVISION Infrastructure Division, our regulated UK wires business, is the UKs third largest distribution company and comprises the distribution and transmission networks in our Scottish service area, and the distribution network in Manweb, over 110,000 circuit km in total.
The strategic priorities of the Infrastructure Division set at the beginning of 2002 03 were: Be at or near the regulatory efficiency frontier Outperform operating cost targets Achieve better than planned output from capex Achieve high standards of customer service Invest consistently to add value For the year to 31 March 2003, the Infrastructure Division reported operating profit of 368 million, an increase of 13 million on last year.
Higher regulated income of 9 million and net cost reductions of 18 million were partly offset by higher depreciation, operational rates, insurance and pension costs of 14 million.
The Infrastructure Division invested net capital expenditure of 230 million during the year, an increase of 32 million compared to the year to 31 March 2002.
Of this, 141 million was invested in network refurbishment, 68 million on network expansion and 21 million on other capital projects.
Net capital expenditure in 2003 04 is expected to increase modestly, with investment concentrated on the regulatory asset base, delivering the regulated rate of return.
In particular, further investment will be undertaken in our overhead network modernisation programme.
ScottishPower annual review 2002 03 06 07 Chief Executives Review continued Be at or near the regulatory efficiency frontier Outperform operating cost targets Achieve better than planned output from capex In line with our strategic priorities, we expect to be at or near the regulatory efficiency frontier for the next price review period beginning in April 2005.
As previously stated, targeted cash cost savings of 75 million due by March 2003 were achieved ahead of schedule by September 2002, reecting our increased commercial focus in the division.
As a result, a further target of 33 million of net cost reductions was identied for completion by 2003 04, with net cost reductions of 18 million being achieved in 2002 03 through the initiatives set out below.
We are achieving better outputs from capital expenditure by ensuring that costs are appropriately allocated to capital projects through our asset manager service provider model and have seen procurement savings of over 10% in a number of key purchase areas such as distribution transformers, overhead lines and cables.
Additionally we have conducted a benchmark review of call centre services, are making more efficient use of contractors, achieving improved staff exibility using site start arrangements and adopting a exible day working system.
Achieve high standards of customer service We continue to focus on delivering high standards of customer service.
Our network performance as measured by Customer Interruptions and Customer Minutes Lost indicates that we are on track to be able to participate in Ofgems Information and Incentives Programme IIP when the reward mechanism for outperforming the regulatory targets is put in place by 2004 05.
Our performance against Ofgems standard for responding to customers written correspondence has improved signicantly.
In addition, our performance relative to the industry as measured by Ofgems customer satisfaction survey has ensured we are placed in the incentive reward band under the terms of the IIP.
Further, a recent Government report recognised our good performance during a gale-force storm in the Mersey and North Wales area on 27 October 2002.
We received specic praise for our performance in emergency preparation, telephone response and regular and realistic feedback to customers on estimated times of reconnection.
Invest consistently to add value Capital expenditure to date contributes to maintaining the value of our asset base.
Progress in the Berwick and Borders Investment Programme, which represents an investment of 11 million, continues to be made with 65% of the 33kV circuits included in the programme being completed.
Additionally 63% of the 11kV circuits included in the programme have been completed or are under construction.
This part of the overhead line build programme has been accelerated and is on target for completion by March 2004.
Regulated UK wires business is the UKs third largest distribution company.
Reinforcement of the transmission network will improve both the performance and resilience of our network, with high prole projects at Gretna and Chapelcross representing a 13 million investment.
Benets of these projects include the strengthening of the network to deal with the Chapelcross power station closure.
These projects are being delivered on time and to budget.
The Government target of 10% of supply from renewable sources by 2010 is an opportunity for Infrastructure Division to invest in network capacity.
Our transmission business has participated in a recent network study that explored the existing Scottish and Northern England networks potential to support increased volumes of new renewable generation.
The study identied three progressive steps required to upgrade our transmission network and we believe the associated investment to be valued at roughly 300 million 400 million over 10 years dependent on renewable progress.
We are currently working to develop detailed plans in relation to this opportunity.
In addition, we believe our distribution networks in Scotland and Manweb are well positioned to develop network investment opportunities in support of renewable generation, should Government targets be met.
The formal price control reviews of SP Transmission, SP Distribution and SP Manweb will continue during the forthcoming year.
We have been working with Ofgem and the rest of the industry to develop the framework of price controls applying to all network monopoly companies and lay the foundations for the formal distribution Price Control Reviews.
We believe a key issue for the reviews is the provision of a sufficient and stable return to allow companies to attract and retain funding from capital markets.
A further issue relates to nding ways to facilitate renewable energy in line with Government targets.
Both have implications for the working of the regulatory regime and for the long-term safety and integrity of the UK electricity infrastructure.
The outcome from the Price Control Review should take account of guidance from the Government on social and environmental objectives, and recognise any additional expenditure arising from such objectives.
Our performance in the recent asset risk management survey demonstrated our ability to invest efficiently and effectively, and our cost and storm response performances provide us with the credibility to inuence this important debate.
We should not lose sight of the fact that the industry is entering a new phase where simple costcutting and moderate investment leading to price cuts for customers will no longer sustain future performance, and price increases will be required.
We are committed to working with Ofgem and the rest of the industry throughout the Price Control Review process to deliver a successful outcome that balances the interests of shareholders, customers and all other stakeholders.
UK DIVISION The UK Division is our competitive, integrated generation and supply business.
The Division manages activities across the energy value chain, maximising value from a diverse energy portfolio of some 5,000 MW of coal, gas, hydro and wind powered plants through to our national customer base of over 3.6 million customers, via an energy management function that acts to balance and hedge energy needs.
The strategic priorities of the UK Division set at the beginning of 2002 03 were: Enhance margins through our integrated operations Grow customer numbers and improve customer service Make selective investments using proven knowledge and skills Operating profit for the UK Division increased by 18 million to 73 million for the year to 31 March 2003, mainly due to last years results including a 19 million exceptional reorganisation charge.
Operating profit, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, was 78 million for the year, 1 million lower compared to the previous year.
Net energy margins have performed strongly, increasing by 15 million before higher depreciation, costs to capture and investment in energy efficiency schemes of 12 million and increased pension costs of 4 million.
The impact of lower wholesale electricity prices has been mitigated by our integrated approach to managing the energy value chain whereby our own electricity production is extensively matched to our customer demand across Great Britain.
The renegotiation of the Nuclear Energy Agreement NEA with British Energy BE at a market related price has delivered a benefit of approximately 25 million in the current year and provides a hedge against revenues which have been impacted by lower wholesale prices.
During the year the UK Division invested 68 million in capital projects, a 41 million reduction on the previous year.
29 million was invested in new generation and gas storage assets, 19 million in generation plant overhaul and refurbishment and 20 million on other projects including business transformation and information technology.
In 2003 04, subject to obtaining planning permission, net capital expenditure for the UK Division could increase substantially as a result of our commitment to increase our windfarm capacity.
In addition, we plan to invest in gas storage development and upgrades to generation assets required to maintain our generating capacity.
All investments are projected to have returns signicantly in excess of the cost of capital and enhance earnings.
Enhance margins through our integrated operations During the year we continued to benefit from the exibility of our plant portfolio.
We have maintained what we believe is a best in class performance in the Balancing Mechanism, in ScottishPower annual review 2002 03 08 09 The success of our company lies in the knowledge, capabilities and skills offered by our employees.
particular from our exible CCGT plant at Rye House, and our pumped storage facility at Cruachan which is being upgraded in capacity by 10%.
We continue to optimise the operating regime across our plant portfolio, aiming to deliver the lowest sustainable costs and to position it to take maximum advantage of commercial opportunities.
The renegotiation of the NEA relieved the Division of a significant cost burden during the year, but the future of the remaining restructuring contracts is still unresolved.
We continue to press the Government strongly on this issue.
Whilst we expect wholesale electricity prices to remain depressed for the next two years, there could be upward price pressure emerging from tightening of the capacity margin throughout Great Britain, and as environmental measures such as carbon trading and the Large Combustion Plants Directive start to take effect.
We may see some price volatility before a new equilibrium is reached.
Retail sales revenues increased during the year, in part following an increase in prices to customers outside our service territories in November 2002.
Prices to the majority of electricity customers in our Scottish and Manweb territories were increased effective 1 April 2003, although in both instances we have preserved our competitive dual fuel prices and provided nearly all customers affected by the April 2003 price increase with the opportunity of mitigating the increase by changing to a more economical product package.
Training and development is available through ScottishPower Learning and PaciCorp Learning to all employees.
Our business transformation programme, which is underpinned by 6 Sigma methodology, continues to deliver significant savings to the business.
In the year to 31 March 2003, we have delivered revenue and cost benets of 14 million across our business processes including sales and marketing, billing and debt.
The utilisation of 6 Sigma methodology is now being extended throughout the UK Division.
Grow customer numbers and improve customer service We continue to be successful in growing our customer base.
Customer numbers now stand at 3.65 million, up by approximately 150,000 in the year to 31 March 2003.
As well as gaining new customers, we have successfully reduced overall churn by 4 percentage points compared with the prior year.
Customer retention and win-back continues to be an important part of our marketing activities and we have deployed TV advertising to good effect, emphasising that our dual fuel customers can benefit from a competitive price by joining ScottishPower.
In response to customer research we introduced a new bill design, to provide clearer and more concise communication of charges and have improved the level of service provided by our call centres during the year.
Customer numbers now stand at 3.65 million, up by approximately 150,000 in the year.
ScottishPower was amongst the pioneers of the industrys EnergySure accreditation scheme for sales staff, which will be governed by an external code administrator.
All ScottishPowers domestic sales teams have now been accredited to this customer service and quality standard and we are now rolling out the scheme to cover all the relevant sales and marketing channels.
In addition we have introduced three new energy products during the year, including Capped Price and No Standing Charge offers, which have further enhanced the range available to customers.
Make selective investments using proven knowledge and skills The Renewables Obligation has created a market framework that allows developers to capitalise on the UKs rich resource of wind energy with eligible developments attracting Renewables ScottishPower annual review 2002 03 10 11 Chief Executives Review continued Obligation Certicates ROCs currently worth approximately 45 for every MWh produced.
With our strong track record in site identication and development, we are well placed to deliver investments with an attractive return and enhanced earnings, and to market effectively the energy produced from renewable sources.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, we have made planning applications for 279 MW of windfarm capacity and we now have in excess of 546 MW awaiting planning consent.
We have also begun environmental assessments on around 300 MW of capacity at additional potential sites.
Progress towards planning consent for our Whitelee 240 MW and Black Law 134 MW developments has been slowed by issues related to radar at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports respectively.
A technical solution to this problem is being progressed and we are confident that the issue will be resolved.
With 546 MW of windfarm capacity awaiting planning consent and the 300 MW pipeline of projects under assessment, we are making excellent progress towards alignment with the Government target of 10% of supply from renewable sources by 2010.
We are upgrading five of our smaller hydro generating stations, totalling 45 MW, to qualify for ROCs.
As part of this, the upgrade to the 11 MW station at Bonnington was completed in 2002 03 with the other four stations to be upgraded over the next 15 months.
Our 60 million therm gas storage planning application at Byley in Cheshire is presently awaiting the result of a public inquiry, expected to be determined in 2003 04.
We are well placed to deliver investments with an attractive return and enhanced earnings.
PPM PPM is our competitive US energy company, focused on providing environmentally responsible energy products to wholesale customers.
Its principal assets are thermal and renewable generation resources and gas storage assets primarily serving western US and Canadian markets.
The strategic priorities of PPM set at the beginning of 2002 03 were: Grow its renewable thermal energy portfolio and gas storage hub services Optimise returns through the integration of assets and commercial activities PPM reported an operating profit of 28 million for the year, compared to a loss of 5 million last year.
The growth in operating profit for the year was due to the increased contribution from longterm sales contracts and gas storage activities and optimisation benets of 53 million, partly offset by higher depreciation charges and other operating costs of 17 million to support business growth and the benefit from settlement of a 3 million contract in the prior year.
PPMs net capital expenditure for the year was 36 million, a decrease of 170 million on last year, which included investment to complete the Klamath Falls and West Valley generation projects.
In the current year, the business invested 30 million in new generation and 6 million in other projects.
In addition, we acquired the Katy gas storage facility for 101 million.
In 2003 04, PPMs net capital spend is expected to increase, primarily as a result of the construction of new windfarms and development opportunities including Moraine and Flying Cloud, which are expected to deliver favourable rates of return and enhance earnings.
Grow its renewable thermal energy portfolio and gas storage hub services PPM continues to grow its renewable energy business and has recently announced the development of the 44 MW Flying Cloud Wind Project in Iowa, which includes a 15 year agreement to sell power to Interstate Power & Light, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy.
In addition, construction of the 51 MW Moraine Wind Project in Minnesota has commenced.
The Moraine project is fully contracted with a 15 year agreement to sell power to the Northern States Power Company.
This will bring PPMs total wind power under contract to more than 560 MW, and total thermal renewable resource under PPMs ownership or control to approximately 1,350 MW.
In addition to its renewable generation portfolio, PPM has a total of 37 billion cubic feet BCF of gas storage capacity under ownership, up from 14 BCF the prior year.
This includes the 21 BCF acquired at the Katy gas storage facility in December 2002 and a 2 BCF expansion of the Alberta Hub gas storage facility during the year.
PPM has successfully integrated the Katy assets and is on target to deliver expected results.
PPM intends to add to its 40% ownership in the Alberta Hub gas storage facility with the purchase of an additional ownership interest this spring.
Optimise returns through integration of assets and commercial activities Integration of plant operations, contract dispatch and energy management added $7 million in the year.
The optimisation benets come from displacing plant operations with low-priced power purchases, selling the displaced gas or placing it in storage, as well as using transmission and contract delivery exibility to manage locational price differences in both gas and power.
PPM has new and expanded terms for energy supply to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, one of PPMs largest customers.
Arrangements include revisions to original long-term contracts executed in 2002 03, as well as sales of up to half the output of the 150 MW High Winds Energy Center in northern California and 100 MW of summer peaking power supply from PPMs portfolio.
In 2002 03, PPM placed 319 MW under long-term contract.
In addition, PPM has effectively managed its commodity exposure, having sold its positions forward for 5-25 years.
Fluctuating commodity prices have little impact on PPMs portfolio value, except where increased volatility gives PPM an opportunity to take advantage of plant options, delivery exibility, gas storage and other tactics to maximise value.
REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENT POLICY ISSUES Multi-State Process MSP PaciCorp continues work on the MSP, which is designed to resolve how prudently incurred costs are allocated among the six states in which PaciCorp operates.
A collaborative process is under way to identify possible solutions, conduct technical conferences with participants and meet with key parties to examine specic issues.
PaciCorp intends to le a final, detailed regulatory proposal with each state utility commission this summer.
RTO West PaciCorp and nine other utilities received initial approval of their RTO West proposal in September 2002 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC.
"Under the proposal, which the FERC called ""Best in Class"" among all the RTO lings in terms of the proposed design, structure and thoroughness of approach, the ling utilities will retain ownership of their transmission assets, but transfer operational control of their system to RTO West."
As proposed, RTO West will help stabilise electricity transmission and guard against market manipulation in the western part of the United States and Canada, while providing a reasonable level of return for future transmission investments.
The RTO West members are currently planning to le with the FERC this summer and expect a response from the FERC by the end of 2003.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The FERC continues its various investigations into western US market manipulation related to the 2000 01 energy crisis.
As a regulated utility that participated in these markets primarily to meet the companys own power requirements, PaciCorp has responded to various data requests from the FERC and other market participants.
These cases involve trading practices connected with the California power crisis, as well as spot market refund cases, and complaints brought by PaciCorp against wholesale power marketers to seek refunds for high-priced power purchased in 2001.
PaciCorp continues to press for economic recovery, while fully responding to requests for information.
British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements BETTA The recently announced delay by the Department of Trade and Industry to the introduction of BETTA will not have a material effect on ScottishPower in 2003 04.
The financial impact of the BETTA Bill is broadly neutral for ScottishPower, but zonal charges for transmission access and losses would have a negative impact on the generation business in the UK Division.
We were pleased to see that the Trade and Industry Select Committee, in its Fifth Report, recommended ScottishPower annual review 2002 03 12 13 ScottishPower, the BiTC Business in the Community Company of the Year and Ballet Central pictured both believe in affordable access to the arts for as many people as possible.
delay in the implementation of transmission access reform until the costs and benets are able to be assessed on a Great Britain-wide basis.
ScottishPower, together with a number of other companies, has led for a judicial review of Ofgems decision to implement zonal transmission losses in England and Wales.
Energy White Paper The recently published White Paper on energy sets out to achieve a lower carbon energy system, proposing significant investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency and in networks.
The UK Division is well placed to take early mover advantage on renewable generation and the Infrastructure Division should benefit from the Governments commitment to investing in networks.
We are pleased that Ofgem recognises the need to plan and develop networks to facilitate the transmission of renewable energy from Scotland to centres of demand in the rest of Great Britain.
LOOKING AHEAD During 2002 03, we reported each quarter our progress in delivering the key strategic priorities Courtesy of The Herald Glasgow SMG Newspapers Ltd. 12 July 2002. for each of our four businesses.
Some of those priorities have now been achieved and further new priorities have been identied.
Accordingly, looking ahead our strategic priorities are as follows: PaciCorp Achieve ROE target $1 billion EBIT by 2004 05 Manage energy risk and supply demand balance Deliver excellent customer service Invest to grow the regulatory asset base, including delivery of the integrated resource plan Infrastructure Division Invest consistently to add future value, including supporting renewables Optimise our position through the 2005 price control reviews and the introduction of BETTA Deliver cost-effective, high quality customer service UK Division Enhance margins through our integrated operations Increase the value of our customer base through targeted sales growth and improved customer service Progress towards achieving 10% of electricity supply from renewable sources by 2010 PPM Continue to be a leading provider of renewable energy products Grow natural gas storage and hub services business Create additional value by optimising the returns from our capability across gas and power CONCLUSION Our consistent focus on performance last year enabled us to deliver a good set of results.
We will continue to place a premium on leading operational performance, to secure further improvements in the results of our businesses.
There are substantial opportunities to expand ScottishPower through incremental investments in each of our businesses, particularly in networks, generation including renewables and gas storage.
With as much as 40% of our capital investment in new assets in these areas, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow.
The outlook for ScottishPower remains positive, with further improvements expected from our businesses.
We also believe that our continued focus will enable us to take advantage of the opportunities to create shareholder value that will, over time, arise from the changing structure of our industry in the UK, the rest of Europe and the US.
