The principal differences are set out below.
profit or loss on disposal of businesses Unilever calculates profit or loss on sale of businesses after writing back any goodwill previously written off directly to reserves as a movement in profit retained.
Under US GAAP the profit or loss on disposal of the businesses is stated net of the relevant unamortised goodwill included on the balance sheet and the cumulative currency retranslation differences recognised through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under UK GAAP, gains on the partial disposal of group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, these gains are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill and intangible assets Under UK and Netherlands GAAP, goodwill being the difference between the fair value of consideration paid for new interests in group companies, joint ventures and associated companies and the fair value of the Groups share of their net assets at the date of acquisition and identiable intangible assets purchased after 1 January 1998 are capitalised and amortised in operating profit over the period of their expected useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Periods in excess of five years are used only where the Directors are satisfied that the life of these assets will clearly exceed that period.
Goodwill and intangible assets purchased prior to 1 January 1998 were written off in the year of acquisition as a movement in profits retained.
On disposal of a business acquired prior to 1 January 1998, purchased goodwill written off on acquisition is reinstated in arriving at the profit or loss on disposal.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, purchased goodwill and identiable intangible assets were capitalised and amortised over their useful lives.
From 1 January 2002, under SFAS 142, the amortisation of goodwill and identiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives ceased.
Intangible assets that have nite useful lives continue to be amortised over their useful lives.
Goodwill and identiable intangible assets that have indefinite lives are assessed annually for impairment.
