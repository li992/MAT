The Group has undertaken a review of the carrying value of goodwill capitalised on the balance sheet.
This review has led to a 585 million impairment charge, principally related to Baan, being recorded in the accounts.
A discount rate of 9.0% has been applied.
Goodwill charged on the disposal of discontinued operations comprises Rexnord 554 million, Flow Control 98 million, Sensor Systems 136 million, Fasco Motors 354 million, Drive Systems 101 million and Other 78 million.

6 Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Group has continued to account for pensions and post-retirement benefits in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No 24: Pension Costs SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in notes i and ii below respectively, are those required by this standard.
Financial Reporting Standard No 17: Retirement Benefits FRS 17 was issued in November 2000 and will ultimately replace SSAP 24.
The transitional disclosures required by FRS 17 are set out in note iii below.
The Group intends to adopt FRS 17 effective from 1 April 2003. i Pensions The Group operates many defined contribution and funded defined benefit pension schemes.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme.
Complete disclosure of all pension scheme details is not practicable within this report.
The most pertinent factors affecting the Groups pension arrangements are discussed below.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme.
The Invensys Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The last valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2000 by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The assumptions that have the most effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions in payment.
The triennial actuarial review of the main UK pension scheme, with a valuation date of 5 April 2003, has recently commenced and we expect a report to be available by September 2003.
41 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 6 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued i Pensions continued A market related approach was taken to assessing these assumptions.
The principal assumption was that the discount rate to measure the Schemes liabilities would be 5.75% which was 1% over the return available on Government debt: 1.75% per annum higher than the rate of salary inflation: and 2.5% per annum higher than the rate of increase in pensions.
At the date of the last valuation the market value of the assets, excluding members additional voluntary contributions, was 4,152 million and was sufficient to cover 118% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The actuarial surplus is being spread over the average remaining service lives of the current employees twelve years at the valuation date by the straight-line method.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries.
Of these the largest US scheme is assessed annually, and the other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed triennially by independent actuaries in accordance with local practice.
Where the requirements of SSAP 24 should be fulfilled, the appropriate cost has been recognised, otherwise local practice has been adopted.
Pension costs for the Group in the year were nil 2002 3 million, based on a normal cost of 42 million 2002 57 million and an actuarial variation of 42 million 2002 54 million.
Debtors falling due within one year, debtors falling due after more than one year, creditors falling due within one year, creditors falling due after more than one year and provisions include 1 million, 400 million, 6 million, 61 million and 84 million respectively for pension prepayments, accruals and provisions 2002 1 million, 373 million, 5 million, 63 million and 98 million respectively.
ii Post-retirement benefits The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which 13,300 employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired former employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
These schemes are generally unfunded.
The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2003.
The assessment was carried out by independent actuaries.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The gross liability of 109 million 2002 196 million at 31 March 2003 is included in provisions for liabilities and charges note 22.
The principal assumptions used were: 6.5% discount rate and medical trend rates for beneficiaries of 13.0% per annum falling to an ultimate rate of 5.0% in 2013.
The cost of these schemes for the Group in the year was 6 million 2002 5 million.
In addition, the Group makes payments to various former employees under medical and workers compensation agreements.
iii FRS 17 The Group operates both funded and unfunded pension and post-retirement schemes.
There are no separate funds or assets to support the unfunded schemes but provisions are included on the balance sheet in respect of these liabilities.
The major assumptions made when valuing the assets and liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under FRS 17 are as follows: For March 2003 the major assumptions are: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Pension Invensys Pension Scheme UK Plan US Other US healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 3.75 4.00 2.80 3.00 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.05 1.60 1.80 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.50 6.50 5.40 6.50 5.90 Inflation rate 2.50 2.50 2.10 2.10 For March 2002 the major assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Pension Invensys Pension Scheme UK Plan US Other US healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.00 3.95 4.00 3.40 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.15 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.00 7.50 6.00 7.50 6.40 Inflation rate 2.50 3.50 2.90 2.30 42 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2003 6 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued iii FRS 17 continued Funded schemes There are two main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world, which have a net deficit of 753 million after deferred taxation of 16 million.

The rights of third parties to terminate the principal schemes and thereby crystallise termination deficits greater than those calculated under FRS 17 have been considered.
On the basis of legal and actuarial advice and a detailed analysis of the alternative options available to the third parties and the Group, the exercise of such powers is considered very unlikely.
There is a consequential impact on the Groups deferred tax position as the net deferred tax assets which would be recognised under FRS 17 would displace 22 million 2002 37 million of deferred tax assets currently recognised in respect of tax losses which are not pension related.
This is a result of the current tax loss position of the Group in certain territories.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on the net liability for schemes, both funded and unfunded, where the extent to which such an asset could be used is currently uncertain as defined by FRS 19.
7 Share of profits of associated undertakings The share of profits of associated undertakings attributable to the Groups interest is nil 2002 2 million, less a tax charge of nil 2002 2 million and less dividends receivable of nil 2002 1 million.

Such gains would only become taxable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief or offset existing capital losses.
The Group does not expect any tax to become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no dividends have been accrued out of those earnings.
Tax losses with a value of 400 million 2002 200 million have not been recognised as their use is uncertain or is not currently anticipated.
A deferred tax asset of 21 million 2002 26 million has not been recognised on timing differences relating to intangible fixed assets as the reversal of these timing differences is expected to increase tax losses.
10 Loss attributable to the parent company The loss dealt with in the accounts of the parent company, Invensys plc, is 4,194 million 2002 profit of 241 million.
In accordance with the exemption granted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been presented.

i Fair values of financial instruments used for risk management The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year end exchange rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments which are given a fair value as book value.
The book value of unlisted fixed asset investments at 31 March 2003 is 22 million 2002 45 million.
