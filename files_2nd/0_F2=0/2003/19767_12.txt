Notes to the financial statements 31 March 2003 1.
Accounting policies The Groups principal accounting policies, which are set out below, have been applied consistently.
1 Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of properties held for investment.
Compliance with SSAP 19, accounting for investment properties, requires departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to depreciation and the explanation of the departure is given in Note 1 5.
The treatment adopted in respect of grants receivable relating to investment properties also represents a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and is explained in Note 1 15.
2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TBI plc and its subsidiaries, all of which are made up to 31 March 2003.
3 Turnover and profit Airport Ownership Turnover, excluding value added tax, represents income arising from the movement of aircraft and passengers, commercial income including income receivable in respect of various concession agreements and tenant income recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Airport Services Turnover, excluding value added tax, represents income arising from the provision of services to airlines and airport operators.
Airport Management Turnover, excluding value added tax, represents income arising from management contracts operated on behalf of third party airports.
Other operations Turnover, excluding value added tax, comprises amounts receivable in respect of goods and services provided.
4 Tangible fixed assets at airports valuation policy On the acquisition of airports, tangible fixed assets are fair valued, normally by independent property consultants, on a basis consistent with the use of each of those assets.
Specialised property, including the airfield, runways, aprons, airport offices and other assets related to the landing and taking off of aircraft is valued on a depreciated replacement cost basis.
Non-specialised property is valued on an existing use basis.
Additions to specialised and non-specialised property, subsequent to acquisition, are included at cost.
These assets are depreciated in accordance with the policies set out in Note 1 6.
Property meeting the investment property criteria, and not occupied by the Company or its subsidiary companies, including certain terminal buildings and car parks together with other properties, is valued at open market value.
5 Investment properties In accordance with SSAP 19, accounting for investment properties, investment properties are revalued annually by independent property consultants and the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to a revaluation reserve.
No provision is made for depreciation of investment properties.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, which requires all properties to be depreciated is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
The depreciation or amortisation which would, had the provisions of the Act been followed, have reduced profit for the year is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount attributable to this factor cannot reasonably be separately identified or quantified.
Profits and losses on disposal of investment properties are included in the profit and loss account as part of the ordinary activities of the Group and are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds and book value at the date of disposal.
34 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements 6 Depreciation The tangible fixed assets of the Group, excluding land, are depreciated on a straight line basis calculated to write down their cost to estimated residual values over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Airport operations Runways, taxiways and aprons 20-100 years Freehold buildings 50 years Car parks 20-50 years Plant and machinery 3-20 years Other operations Aircraft 10 years Hotel property 50 years fixtures and fittings 3-30 years Leasehold buildings are depreciated over the lower of 50 years and the remaining life of the lease.
In the case of tangible fixed assets relating to fixed term concession agreements, the above asset lives are subject to a maximum of the remaining life of the concession agreement.
Assets with an estimated useful economic life greater than 50 years are subject to annual review for impairment.
7 Leased assets Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The present value of the minimum lease payments is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset.
Future installments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding finance lease liability.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rentals charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
8 Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision for impairment.
9 Trade investments Trade investments are valued at cost less any provision for impairment.
10 Goodwill and other intangible assets In accordance with FRS 10, goodwill and intangible assets, since 1 April 1998 acquired goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life.
This has a maximum of 20 years and is subject to review for impairment.
Previously, goodwill arising on acquisition was written off directly to reserves at the date of acquisition.
Negative goodwill is credited to the profit and loss account over the useful economic life of the asset to which it relates, subject to any acceleration necessary in order to recognise an impairment of that asset.
The cost of other intangible assets is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the lower of 20 years or the minimum useful life of the related asset.
11 Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
12 Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on all material timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
35 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements 31 March 2003 continued 13 Pension costs The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The pension costs in respect of the defined contribution pension schemes comprise contributions payable in respect of the year.
In accordance with the requirement of SSAP 24, accounting for pension costs, with the exception of the defined benefit scheme in the US, the pension costs in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes comprise the expected cost of providing pensions, as calculated periodically by professional qualified actuaries, which are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the expected average service lives of the employees in the scheme, in such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll.
As permitted by SSAP 24, on grounds of materiality, the defined benefit scheme in existence in the US is accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US.
14 Costs associated with the raising of finance Under the provisions of FRS 4, capital instruments, costs associated with the raising of relevant finance are accounted for as a deduction from the amount of consideration received.
The costs are then amortised over the life of the instrument.
15 Grants Grants receivable in respect of tangible fixed assets are credited to the profit and loss account over the expected useful economic lives of the relevant assets to which they relate.
Grants received but not yet released to the profit and loss account are included as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Grants receivable in respect of investment properties are credited directly to the cost of the asset.
This treatment is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 which requires fixed assets to be shown at cost and grants as deferred income.
The treatment has been adopted in accordance with section 227 6 of the Companies Act 1985 in order to show a true and fair view as, in the opinion of the directors, it is not appropriate to treat grants on investment properties as deferred income.
Investment properties are not depreciated and accordingly no basis exists on which to recognise the release of deferred income to the profit and loss account.
The accumulated impact of this treatment is to reduce the deferred income and investment property costs by 1,361,000 2002: 1,361,000.
16 Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the financial year and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening investment in subsidiary companies, and from the translation of the results of those companies at the average rate, are taken to reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other foreign exchange differences which are not effectively hedged in accordance with SSAP 20, foreign currency translation, are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
17 Capitalisation of interest Interest is capitalised on major development projects and capital works in progress where appropriate.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to get the asset ready for use are completed.
18 Financial instruments The derivative instruments utilised by the Group are currency swaps, currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps.
Currency swap and forward exchange contracts are translated at the rates prevailing in the contracts and the resulting gains or losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group.
Interest differentials on interest rate swaps are recognised by adjusting the net interest charge.

Borrowings and financial instruments Treasury policy Treasury activity is managed centrally and is focused on monitoring working capital, managing external and internal funding and managing financial market risks in particular interest and currency exposures.
Treasury activity is not a profit centre and the Group neither enters into transactions of a speculative nature nor trades in financial instruments.
Treasury risk management policies are summarised below: Interest rate risk operations are financed through a mixture of bank borrowings, long term loans and hire purchase arrangements.
The Group borrows in appropriate currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and also uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
It is the Groups policy to keep a proportion of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest and as at 31 March 2003 some 70% 2002: 54% was either at a fixed rate or subject to hedging arrangements.
Liquidity risk the Groups policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
As at 31 March 2003, 36% 2002: 39% of borrowings were due to mature in more than five years, but only some 13% 2002: 7% were due to mature within two years.
Foreign currency risk overseas operations give rise to an exposure to currency rates.
Currency exposures arise on the translation of profits earned by overseas investments and on the translation of the net assets of overseas investments.
Profit translation exposures are not usually hedged as they are an accounting rather than cash exposure and the use of average exchange rates to account for currency profits results in a smoothing effect on short term currency movements.
The balance sheet translation exposure is managed primarily by matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
At 31 March 2003 the Group was 81% 2002: 72% hedged on that basis.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.

This loan note was redeemed during the year.
Currency exposures As far as possible, the Group hedges foreign currency translation exposures on overseas assets and liabilities by using loans denominated in those foreign currencies.
The Group has no significant currency exposures arising from its operating activities.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 March is as follows: Loans Finance lease Other Total Total and hire financial purchase liabilities arrangements 2003 2003 2003 2003 2002 000 000 000 000 000 In one year or less, or on demand 8,526 1,773 476 10,775 12,074 In more than one year but not more than two years 10,074 1,528 11,602 6,974 In more than two years but not more than five years 88,573 2,709 91,282 112,776 In more than five years 63,652 45 2,315 66,012 79,403 170,825 6,055 2,791 179,671 211,227 49 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements 31 March 2003 continued 19.

At 31 March 2003 the notional principal amounts of derivatives relating to interest rate swap and cap and collar agreements were 105.8 million 2002: 107.8 million and are analysed as follows: Instrument Currency Principal 000 Maturity date Fixed interest rate swap 6.3% GBP 69,000 31 March 2013 Interest rate cap 7.0%, floor 5.6% USD 20,000 10 January 2006 Fixed interest rate swap 5.9% USD 20,000 10 January 2006 Interest rate cap 7.1%, floor 4.3% SEK 100,000 21 July 2003 The GBP 69.0 million principal fixed interest rate swap agreement reduces in half yearly installments from 30 September 2002 to nil at 31 March 2013 in accordance with a predetermined schedule.
The agreement was entered into to fix the interest rate on the term loan in London Luton Airport Operations Limited.
The USD 20.0 million 12.7 million cap and collar and USD 20.0 million 12.7 million fixed rate swap were entered into as hedges against increases in USD interest rates.
The SEK 100.0 million 6.8 million cap and collar agreement was entered into as a hedge against increases in SEK interest rates.
Fair values of financial instruments In the table below the fair value of the loan note receivable, cash, other bank deposits and short term borrowings approximates to book values due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of long term borrowings has been determined by reference to prices available from the financial markets on which these borrowings are traded.
The fair value is calculated excluding any penalty clauses inherent in the financial instruments and will only crystallise if future interest rates remain at 31 March 2003 levels.
The fair value of the other financial liabilities is not significantly different from the book value.
The fair value of the interest rate and currency swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.

It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
In line with the Groups accounting policy, borrowings swapped into other currencies are translated at the contract rates and floating rate interest borrowings swapped into fixed rate borrowings are translated at the contract rates.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant borrowing effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below: Gains Losses Total net gains losses 000 000 000 Gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2002 6 6 Arising in previous years included in 31 March 2003 income 1,090 1,090 Gains and losses not included in 31 March 2003 income Arising in year ended 31 March 2003 2,061 2,061 Transfer of loss position at the end of the year 3,145 3,145 Gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2003 3,145 3,145 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be included in 31 March 2004 income 1,090 1,090 Gains and losses expected to be included in 31 March 2005 income or thereafter 2,055 2,055 51 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements 31 March 2003 continued 20.

Pension costs The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in respect of Cardiff International Airport Limited CIA, Belfast International Airport Limited BIA, London Luton Airport Operations Limited LLAO, TBI Airport Management, Inc. TBIAM and Airport Group International, Inc. AGI.
In addition, there are also defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the defined contribution pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group, under independent administration.
The pension cost charge for these schemes represents contributions payable by the Group to the schemes in the year amounting to some 861,000 2002: 714,000.
An amount of some 10,000 2002: nil is included in creditors in respect of these pension costs.
Details of the principal defined benefit pension schemes are as follows: CIA and BIA The CIA and BIA defined benefit schemes were merged on 30 June 2000 and the combined Scheme is called the TBI Group Final Salary Pension Plan TGFSPP.
The first valuation of the TGFSPP has been carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2002.
The TGFSPP is a funded defined benefit scheme and its assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to the TGFSPP are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the Attained Age Method of Valuation.
The latest valuation of the TGFSPP assumed that the rate of return on investments would exceed salary increases by 3.0% and would exceed annual pension increases by 2.3%, and the value of its assets was sufficient to cover 79.0% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Based on the findings of the actuary, the contribution rates will be 25.0% with effect from 1 June 2003.
At the time of the valuation, it was anticipated that this increased contribution rate would remove the deficit in funding over the average expected remaining service lives of the members.
The market value of the assets was some 23,231,000 at 30 June 2002.
An amount of some 69,000 2002: 73,000 is included in creditors, being the contributions collected from the employees and CIA and BIA at the year end not yet paid over to the TGFSPP.
The pension cost for the year was some 560,000 2002: 587,000 in respect of the TGFSPP.
The TGFSPP, comprising the merged BIA and CIA schemes, is closed to new entrants.
New employees are offered membership of defined contribution pension scheme arrangements.
LLAO The Group operates a defined benefit scheme, London Luton Airport Pension Scheme LLAPS, at LLAO.
The LLAPS is a funded defined benefit scheme and its assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to the LLAPS are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The LLAPS was established on 28 March 1988 to provide pensions for the employees of London Luton Airport Limited LLAL.
LLAO took over as Principal Employer for the purposes of the LLAPS with effect from 21 August 1998.
The latest valuation of the LLAPS, prepared as at 31 March 2002, was based on the Projected Unit Method of Valuation and assumed that the rate of return on investments held in respect of accrued service would exceed salary increases by 1.9% and on future service by 2.4%.
The market value of its assets of some 19,400,000 at 31 March 2002 was sufficient to cover 95.0% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
This assessment takes into account the remaining installments of additional contributions being paid to fund the costs arising from a reorganisation programme.
The contribution rates at LLAO were increased from 10.2% to 11.1% with effect from 1 April 2002 and further increased to 11.9% of pensionable pay from 1 January 2003.
An amount of some 115,000 2002: 98,000 is included in creditors, being the contributions collected from the employees and LLAO at the year end not yet paid over to the LLAPS.
Some employees transferring between LLAL and LLAO were formerly members of the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS.
They were unable to continue active membership of the LGPS but were able to join the LLAPS on the date of transfer.
These employees were allowed six months in which to opt to transfer their past service benefits into the LLAPS on a year for year credit.
As required by the concession agreement between LLAO and LLAL, the obligation to meet the anticipated funding of the estimated shortfall between transferred values from the LGPS and full funding of the obligation relating to the past service of these employees has been met.
Accordingly, no further payments have been made in the year 2002: 462,000 by LLAO to LLAPS for this purpose.
However LLAO has made additional payments of some 600,000 2002: 350,000 to fund additional costs arising due to a reorganisation programme in accordance with the trust deed.

Pension costs continued TBIAM and AGI As explained in Note 5, there are employees working in AGI and TBIAM whose costs are fully reimbursed by third parties who retain the risks and rewards of employment.
All hourly employees of TBIAM and AGI, including those which are fully reimbursed but excluding those who participate in a union sponsored plan, participate in a defined benefit pension plan.
Contributions to the defined benefit pension plan, TBI US Inc Retirement Plan for Certain Hourly Employees TRPCHE, are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of annual valuations using the Entry Age Normal Cost Method.
The valuation of the entire TRPCHE scheme as at 31 March 2003 2002: 31 December 2001 assumed that the rate of returns on investments would be 8.5% and the value of the assets of the scheme was some 3,399,000 US$5,354,000 2002: 4,011,000 US$5,721,000.
An amount of some 241,000 US$379,000 2002: 344,000 US$490,000 is included in creditors at the year end representing contributions not yet paid over to TRPCHE.
The pension cost for the year, in respect of the staff that were not fully reimbursed, was some 230,000 US$335,000 2002: 187,000 US$266,000.
