In accordance with the amendment to FRS3 published in June 1999, no note of historical cost profits has been prepared as the Groups only material gains and losses on assets relate to the holding and disposal of investments.
The Group has no other recognised gains and losses during the current and previous year and therefore a separate statement of total recognised gains and losses has not been presented.
The notes and information on pages 53 to 79 form part of these accounts.
