Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 4 Exceptional items million million million 2003 2002 2001 Restated Restated Included in operating profit Restructuring 470 1 163 1 506 Other, principally business disposals 370 461 927 Total 100 702 579 These amounts, which include amounts relating to joint ventures, are mainly included in administrative expenses.
Exceptional items are those items within ordinary activities which, because of their size or nature, are disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying result for the period.
These include restructuring charges in connection with reorganising businesses comprising impairment of xed assets, costs of severance, and other costs directly attributable to the restructuring, and profits and losses on disposal of businesses.
United Kingdom FRS 3 would require profits and losses on disposal of most businesses to be excluded from operating profit.
However, because the business disposals above and the restructuring costs are part of a series of linked initiatives, separate presentation would not give a true and fair view and therefore we have included all exceptional items arising from these initiatives on a single line in operating profit.
Costs associated with restructuring, such as training, are recognised as they arise and are not treated as exceptional.
The exceptional items in 2003, 2002 and 2001 principally relate to a series of linked initiatives the Path to Growth, announced on 22 February 2000 to align the organisation behind plans for accelerating growth and expanding margins and to restructuring arising from the integration of Bestfoods.
The total net cost of these programmes is estimated to be 6.2 billion over five years, most of which is expected to be exceptional restructuring costs.
Provisions for these costs and asset write downs are being recognised as necessary consultations are completed and plans nalised.
In 2003, 0.3 billion of net costs have been incurred under Path to Growth programmes, of which a net 0.1 billion is exceptional.
To date, which is four years into the five-year programme, the total net cost incurred is 5.4 billion, of which a net 4.5 billion is exceptional.
In 2002, exceptional items included 1.1 billion of Path to Growth net costs.
Other exceptional items in 2002 included the release of provisions 98 million against environmental exposures when events showed that the provisions were no longer required.
These provisions were originally recorded on the acquisition of the Bestfoods business.
In 2001, exceptional items included 1.4 billion of Path to Growth net costs and 811 million gain on the sale of brands to secure regulatory approval for the acquisition of Bestfoods.
