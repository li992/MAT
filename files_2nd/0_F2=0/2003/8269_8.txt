Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in the Chairmans Statement and the Chief Executives Review.
These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.
Forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, goal, believe, or other words of similar meaning.
These statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by InterContinental Hotels Groups management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate.
By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty.
There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: events that impact domestic or international travel: levels of consumer and business spending in major economies where InterContinental Hotels Group does business: changes in consumer tastes and preferences: levels of marketing and promotional expenditure by InterContinental Hotels Group and its competitors: changes in the cost and availability of raw materials, key personnel and changes in supplier dynamics: significant fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and tax rates: the availability and effects of future business combinations, acquisitions or dispositions, the impact of legal and regulatory actions or developments: the impact of the European Economic and Monetary Union: the ability of InterContinental Hotels Group to maintain appropriate levels of insurance: exposures relating to franchise or management contract operations: the maintenance of InterContinental Hotels Groups IT structure, including its centralised reservation system: the development of new and emerging technologies: competition in the markets in which InterContinental Hotels Group operates: political and economic developments and currency exchange fluctuations: economic recession: management of InterContinental Hotels Groups indebtedness and capital resource requirements: material litigation against InterContinental Hotels Group: substantial trading activity in InterContinental Hotels Group shares: the reputation of InterContinental Hotels Groups brands: the level of costs associated with leased properties: and the weather.
Other factors that could affect the business and financial results are described in Item 3 Risk Factors as General Risks, Additional Risks relating to Six Continents Hotels and Additional Risks relating to the Soft Drinks business in the Annual Report of Six Continents PLC on Form 20-F for the financial year ended 30 September 2002, or in any Annual Report of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC on Form 20-F for any subsequent year, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
