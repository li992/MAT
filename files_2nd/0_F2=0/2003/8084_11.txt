18 Informa Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis.
The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
Following the announcement last year that implementation of FRS 17: Retirement Benefits has been deferred until 2005, the Group continues to prepare its accounts based on SSAP 24 and to provide the additional information required by FRS 17 as revised.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Goodwill and publishing rights Purchased goodwill both positive and negative arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired before 1 January 1998, when FRS 10: Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life which, in the case of the majority of acquisitions to date, is estimated to be 20 years.
Impairment reviews are carried out in accordance with FRS 11 to ensure that goodwill is not carried at above its recoverable amount.
All amortisation and any impairment of goodwill is charged to the profit and loss account.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
No value is attributed to publishing rights acquired as the Directors consider this cannot be reliably measured.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for permanent impairment, if any.
Turnover Turnover represents the amount receivable, excluding sales taxes, for products and services supplied to customers and is stated after deduction of trade discounts and provisions for subscription returns and cancellations.
Subscription income is deferred and recognised over the period of the subscription.
Conference income is recognised when the conference is held.
Currency translation Company Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Group Trading results denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the average monthly exchange rate.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on retranslation of opening net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings is taken directly to reserves.
Differences on foreign currency borrowings, which are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, are taken directly to reserves so far as they offset the exchange differences on the net investment in these enterprises.
The exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the profit and loss account at the year end rate are taken to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments The Group uses interest rate and currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations.
These instruments are accounted for as hedges if designated as such at the inception of contracts.
The swaps are not revalued to fair value in the Group balance sheet at the year end but are disclosed in the fair value table in note 32.
Interest differentials are recognised by accruing the net interest receivable or payable.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Finance costs associated with debt issuance are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
19 Informa Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 Depreciation and amortisation The cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual value is depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Annual rate Freehold buildings 2% Short leasehold properties and property improvements Over life of lease Equipment, fixtures and fittings 10% 33.3% Motor vehicles 20% 25% Freehold and short leasehold properties and property improvements are carried at cost less depreciation and provisions for impairment in value.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Fixed assets acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking are included at the original cost less depreciation to the acquired business except to the extent that their fair value is considered to be different in which case the accumulated depreciation is adjusted accordingly.
Stocks and work in progress Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Conference costs in advance represent costs incurred for conferences planned to be held after the balance sheet date.
Deferred promotional expenditure Promotional expenditure incurred during the year is matched against revenue generated by that expenditure.
Deferred promotional expenditure included in the balance sheet represents expenditure incurred during the year in respect of revenue which is expected to arise after the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is provided in full for timing differences, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are capitalised with the corresponding obligation to pay future rentals being included in creditors.
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee.
The assets are valued at the equivalent purchase price and are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the unexpired portion of the lease.
The excess of the lease payments over the value of the lease obligations is treated as a finance charge and is allocated to accounting periods over the duration of the lease to approximate to a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pension costs Certain subsidiaries operate defined contribution pension schemes for employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the individual companies.
The pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions payable.
The Group also operates a funded defined benefit scheme for employees.
The expected cost of pensions of the defined benefit pension scheme is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees in the scheme.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the remaining service lives of current employees in the schemes.
The pension cost associated with this scheme is addressed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
FRS 17: Retirement Benefits will require a market rather than actuarial valuation of defined benefit schemes.
This will result in a greater volatility of the pension scheme surplus as the market valuation will be taken at each balance sheet date and be reflective of a particular point in time.
At 31 December 2003, the Group has adopted the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17 as set out in note 22.
The Group interest expense is arranged centrally and is not attributable to individual markets or geographical locations.
Trading between segments is not significant.

These assets may become recoverable if trading entities to which the tax losses relate to realise taxable profits.
The deferred tax asset recognised, represents timing differences with regard to the exceptional items as disclosed in note 4.
30 Informa Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 22 Pensions The Group operates, a number of defined contribution schemes and a defined benefit scheme designed to provide benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Details of these are given below.
The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of Group companies.
A pension cost charge of 1,798,000 2002: 1,737,000 represents contributions payable on all defined contribution schemes held by the combined Group.
The total pension cost for the funded defined benefit pension scheme was 1,017,000 2002: 1,158,000.
The pension cost is assessed on the basis of triennial valuations in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary, using the attained age method.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2002.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date was 16,944,000.
The funding level of the scheme on a discounted cash flow valuation basis was 76% at the date of the valuation.
This deficiency is to be made good by additional contributions spread forward over future working lifetimes.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increases in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed that the real rate of return on investments would be 1.5% above indexlinked gilt real yield per annum, that salary increases would average 4.2% per annum and that present and future pensions would increase in line with price inflation at 2.7% per annum.
From 1 April 2003 the employees contribution increased to 10% from 6% and the Groups contribution increased to 18.9% from 15.9% following a valuation recommended by the Actuary for the scheme.
The next formal actuarial valuation of this scheme is due to be carried out as at 1 April 2005.
The actuarial valuation of the scheme was updated to 31 December 2003 by a qualified actuary, using a set of assumptions consistent with those required under FRS 17.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 31 December 31 December 31 December 2003 2002 2001 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.2% 3.9% 4.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.7% 2.4% 2.6% Discount rate 5.3% 5.5% 6.0% Inflation assumption 2.7% 2.4% 2.6% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were, if FRS 17 had been adopted in full: 3 years comparables 31 December 31 December 31 December 2003 2002 2001 Rate of Rate of Rate of return 000 return 000 return 000 Equities 7% 14,707 7% 11,275 8% 12,612 Bonds 5% 2,029 5% 2,522 6% 2,745 Cash 4% 1,253 4% 777 4% 791 Total market value of assets 17,989 14,574 16,148 Present value of liabilities 31,883 25,328 20,791 Deficit in the scheme 13,894 10,754 4,643 Related deferred tax asset 4,168 3,226 1,393 Net pension liability 9,726 7,528 3,250 The amount of this net pension liability would also be included in the Groups profit and loss account reserve.

37 Informa Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 32 Financial risk management Treasury policy The Board set the Groups treasury policy to ensure that it has adequate financial resources to develop the Groups businesses and to manage the currency and interest risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Groups policy is not to enter into speculative transactions.
Group Treasury acts as a service centre operating under the clearly defined regulation of the Board.
Funding and deposit management: The Group primarily borrows at short term variable rates under its multi-currency revolving loan facilities.
In December 2003 the Group arranged a new 140m 5 year facility and a new 40m 18 month facility.
In 2001, the Group raised US$50m on the US private placement market.
The 7.35% Guaranteed Senior Unsecured Notes due in 7 equal annual terms from 15 August 2005 to 15 August 2011, are diversifying and consolidating funding outside the bank market.
The US dollars received have been swapped into floating GB sterling, US dollar and Euro loans.
In order to minimise interest costs, foreign currency borrowings are utilised to the extent that they can be hedged internally to the Group.
Cash pooling arrangements have been made in GB sterling, Euros, Japanese Yen and US dollars to maximise the interest receivable on surplus working capital.
The Group monitors the distribution of its cash assets, borrowings and facilities so as to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
Currency risk management: Foreign currency borrowings are hedged against foreign currency investments.
The revenue and expenditure of the Groups business units is generally matched in the local currency, limiting such exposure.
Interest rate risk management: The Group policy allows the fixing of that proportion of debt that is deemed to be sufficiently certain in the long term.
At the balance sheet date, 147,322,000 of debt is fixed under interest rate swap agreements lasting up to December 2010.
The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are taken as and when they occur and yielded a loss of 1,412,000 in the year 2002: loss 847,000 which is dealt with as a component of interest payable.
The net unrecognised loss on derivative instruments is 1,177,000 2002: loss 1,646,000.
Short-term debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial asset or liability under FRS13 have been excluded from all numerical disclosures in this note except for the analysis of net currency exposure.
i Fair values of financial instruments used for risk management The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of financial instruments at 31 December 2003 was: 2003 2003 2002 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 000 000 000 000 Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Overdrafts 1,271 1,271 2,062 2,062 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 4,201 4,201 374 374 Long-term borrowings 183,121 183,121 98,288 98,288 Cash deposits 10,454 10,454 5,195 5,195 Other financial assets 3,253 3,253 1,147 1,147 Other financial liabilities 20 18 228 210 Derivative financial instruments held to manage profile Interest rate swaps and similar instruments 877 2,585 651 2,564 Forward rate agreements and similar instruments 40 Forward exchange deals and similar instruments 532 307 Included in the above borrowings is 5,876,000 of loan notes 2002: nil.
The carrying value of primary financial instruments approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest at rates approximate to market.
The book value of fixed asset investments approximates to the fair value, being the estimated sale proceeds.
