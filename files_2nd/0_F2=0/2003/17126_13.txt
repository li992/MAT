Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and company law except as set out below in respect of intangible fixed assets.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the audited accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the same period end as the Group.
In April 2002, shareholders of William Hill Holdings Limited WHH agreed to exchange their shares in WHH for shares in the Company as part of a group reorganisation.
This transaction was accounted for using merger accounting as required by Financial Reporting Standard FRS 6 Acquisitions and mergers.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions On the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of tangible fixed assets, other assets and liabilities acquired, represents goodwill, which is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out under intangible fixed assets.
Intangible fixed assets The Groups intangible assets represent licence value, goodwill and brand value.
Intangible assets such as licences and brands that are purchased as part of a business cannot be measured reliably and are therefore subsumed within purchased goodwill in accordance with paragraph 13 of FRS10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
The Companies Act 1985 requires goodwill and intangible assets to be amortised over a finite period.
The directors consider that the Groups intangible assets have an indefinite life due to: the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a well established market: the proven and sustained demand for bookmaking services and greyhound racing: the operation of current law that acts as a barrier to entry for new entrants: and the Groups track record of successfully renewing its betting permits and licences.
Consequently, the directors consider that to amortise these assets would not provide a true and fair view and so the financial statements depart from this specific requirement of the Companies Act 1985.
If this departure from the Companies Act 1985 had not been made the profit for the financial period would have been reduced by amortisation.
The amount of this amortisation cannot be quantified because of the indefinite life of these assets.
The non-amortisation of the intangible assets means that they are subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with FRS10 and FRS11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, less provision, if any, for impairment together with additions at cost, less cumulative depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties over the unexpired period of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment and motor vehicles at variable rates between 3 and 10 years Web site development costs Design and content development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset delivering benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised.
If there is insufficient evidence on which to base reasonable estimates of the economic benefits that will be generated in the period until the design and content are next updated, the costs of developing the design and content are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
32 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Statement of Accounting Policies for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any, for impairment.
Own shares held in trust, to the extent that they are used to satisfy share option schemes, are amortised over the periods of awards to which they relate.
Shares that are not yet allocated to individuals are carried at cost or marked to market value if the directors consider there has been a permanent diminution in their value.
Associates Shares in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of profit on ordinary activities before finance charges, attributable finance charges and attributable taxation of associated undertakings.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the investment in associated undertakings is shown as the Groups share of net assets or liabilities of associated undertakings and the unamortised element of goodwill relating to the acquisition of associated undertakings.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out under intangible fixed assets.
Stocks Stocks represent stocks of consumables in stores and goods for resale within the greyhound stadia.
They are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Revenue recognition and turnover In accordance with Application Note G to Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, revenue is recognised under an exchange transaction with a customer, when, and to the extent that, the Group obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance.
Turnover is the revenue resulting from exchange transactions under which the Group supplies to customers the services that it is in business to provide as set out below.
In the case of the LBO, telephone and interactive sportsbook businesses including FOBTs, games on the online arcade and other numbers bets, turnover represents the gross takings receivable from customers in respect of individual bets placed, on events that have occurred by the period end.
In the case of AWPs and the online casino operation, turnover represents the net winnings excluding VAT from customers on gaming activity completed by the period end.
Turnover from the online poker business reflects the net income rake earned from poker games completed by the period end.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, turnover represents income arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, including sales of refreshments and tote income.
33 Statement of Accounting Policies for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 Statement of Accounting Policies Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the periods of the leases.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
Pensions The Group operates a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme open to eligible employees in the Group.
The assets of the schemes are held and managed separately from those of the Group.
For the defined contribution scheme the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits represents the contributions payable in the period.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefit scheme the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
They are included as part of staff costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of other finance costs or income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of the related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at an average rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences arising are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange and the assets and liabilities at closing rates of exchange.
Differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets and from translating results at average rates and assets and liabilities at closing rates are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of that debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is reduced by payments made in the period.
Accrued finance costs are included within accruals and deferred income.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate swaps.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Termination payments made or received are spread over the life of the underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues to exist.
In other cases termination payments are taken to the profit and loss account.

35 Notes to the Financial Statements for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Segmental information continued The directors believe that gross win and operating profit are more important performance metrics than turnover.
Net assets liabilities have been allocated by segment where assets and liabilities can be identified with a particular channel.
Corporate net assets include goodwill, corporation and deferred tax, borrowings net of cash balances, pension liability and dividends payable as well as any assets and liabilities that cannot be allocated to a particular channel other than on an arbitrary basis.
Turnover and operating profit amounting to 2.3m and 0.5m respectively have been consolidated into these results in respect of Team Greyhounds Brough Park Limited which was acquired by the Group on 3 March 2003 note 17.
The segmental analysis of gross win set out above is shown before deducting GPT, duty, levies, VAT and other cost of sales to arrive at gross profit.

Tax on profit on ordinary activities The tax charge comprises: 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 31 December 2002 m m UK corporation tax at 30% 50.3 11.9 UK corporation tax prior periods 0.8 Consortium relief receivable prior periods 1.1 1.5 Overseas tax 0.2 Share of associated undertaking tax charge 0.8 0.5 Total current tax charge 49.0 10.9 Deferred tax origination and reversal of timing differences 3.8 0.3 Total tax on profit on ordinary activities 45.2 11.2 The effective tax rate in respect of ordinary activities before exceptional items was 26.5% 52 weeks ended 31 December 2002 28.1%.
The tax charge is lower than the statutory tax rate of 30% mainly due to a deferred tax credit and adjustments in respect of prior periods.
The differences between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 31 December 2002 m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 170.8 32.4 Tax on Group profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 30% 52 weeks ended 31 December 2002 30% 51.2 9.7 Accelerated capital allowances 0.2 1.0 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 2.3 1.5 Other short term timing differences 0.5 Disallowable expenses 0.8 3.7 Held over gains crystallising 0.7 Utilisation of tax losses 1.7 Total current tax charge 49.0 10.9 The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30%.

Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued The elements of deferred tax assets liabilities shown on the balance sheet are as follows: 30 December 2003 31 December 2002 m m Accelerated capital allowances 1.0 4.7 Held over gains 0.6 1.7 Tax losses to be recovered 5.8 Deferred tax asset shown in debtors note 19 6.2 3.0 Deferred tax on pension liability note 24 13.6 11.9 19.8 14.9 Movement in the period: Asset at beginning of period 14.9 4.5 Acquired during period 0.3 Amount credited charged to profit and loss account 3.8 0.3 Amount credited to statement of total recognised gains and losses 1.1 11.0 Asset at end of period 19.8 14.9 The current rate of corporation tax of 30% has been used to calculate the amount of deferred tax.
Provision has been made for all deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of accelerated capital allowances, held over capital gains and short term timing differences, arising from transactions recognised in the financial statements of the current and previous periods.
No provision has been made for the deferred tax liability of 2.5m 31 December 2002 2.3m in respect of capital gains rolled over into nondepreciating assets as it is the intention to retain these assets for the foreseeable future.
Tax on these rolled over gains would only become payable if the assets were sold without further rollover relief.
Deferred tax assets of 13.4m 31 December 2002 22.7m in respect of carried forward tax losses have not been recognised, as it is not expected that taxable profits will arise in the foreseeable future in the companies with the losses.
The Company has no provided or unprovided deferred tax assets or liabilities.

The investment has been accounted for as an associated undertaking using the net equity method and the change in the Groups share of its net liabilities assets is shown above.
The SIS group of companies provides real time pre-event information and results, as well as live coverage of horse racing, greyhound racing and certain numbers draws, via satellite.
The statutory financial statements of SIS are prepared to the year ending 31 March.
The consolidated figures above are based on management accounts for the calendar year 2003.

Investments continued A provision was made in 1999 against goodwill relating to the acquisition of shares in SIS to recognise impairment in the carrying value.
William Hill Organization Limited holds directly or indirectly 33% of the entire share capital of Lucky Choice Limited and of 49s Limited.
These companies were formed for the purpose of promoting and publicising certain numbers betting formats.
In the opinion of the directors, the results of these companies are not material to the results of the Group.
Consequently, the investments have been stated at cost and have not been accounted for under the net equity method, which would normally be appropriate for an associated undertaking.
c Own shares held under trust Group m At 1 January 2003 4.4 Amortisation of shares 1.6 At 30 December 2003 2.8 On 1 August 2001, the Companys subsidiary, William Hill Holdings Limited established the William Hill Holdings 2001 Employee Benefit Trust Trust.
