Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2003 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued in January 2003.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year.
e Investments Listed investments are valued in the financial statements at middle market prices and unlisted investments at a valuation determined by the Directors.
In determining the valuation of unlisted investments the Directors adopt the middle market price where a dealing facility exists and apply a discount if considered appropriate.
Where no dealing facility exists the factors to which the directors have regard include, inter alia, the earnings record and growth prospects of the security, the ratings of comparable listed companies, the yield on the security, where appropriate, and any recent transactions.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the company are stated at the amount of the net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
42 Murray International Trust PLC g Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
For unmatched forward exchange contracts entered into to hedge against fluctuating exchange rates on foreign currency assets or liabilities, the difference between the value at the contracted rate and at the forward rate ruling at the year end is taken credit for as a debtor or provided for as a creditor.
Translation of all other foreign currency balances including matched forward contracts, foreign assets and foreign liabilities is at the middle rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as capital gain or loss in the capital reserve or revenue account depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.

The terms of these loans permit early repayment at the borrowers option which may give rise to additional amounts being either payable or repayable in respect of fluctuations in interest rates since drawdown.
Since the Directors, currently, have no intention of repaying the loans early, they have been included in the accounts to 31 December 2003 at their principal amounts.
The Company has a 50,000,000 multi currency facility which expires on the 25 October 2004 and an uncommitted facility of 25,000,000, neither of which was drawn down as at 31 December 2003.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, the purpose of which is to manage currency and market risks arising from the Companys activities and bank loans and futures.
The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement, ii interest rate risk, iii liquidity risk, and iv foreign currency risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude short-term debtors and creditors, other than for currency disclosures.
50 Murray International Trust PLC Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process as detailed on page 18 both act to reduce market price risk.
The portfolio Managers actively monitor market prices throughout the year and report to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to market movements on investments by using futures as a hedge against potential adverse market movements.
Futures are used to effect a change in asset allocation efficiently and quickly.
On this occasion, futures were used to gain exposure to the United States.. At 31 December 2003 the Company had a future which showed an unrealised gain of 94,000 31 December 2002 loss of 7,000.
During the year ended 31 December 2003 a gain of 1,786,000 was realised 31 December 2002 loss of 2,155,000.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through bank borrowings in the desired currencies.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise fixed rate, revolving and uncommitted facilities.
The fixed rate is used to finance opportunities at low rates and, the revolving and uncommitted facilities to provide flexibility in the short-term.
Current guidelines state that the total borrowings will not exceed 30 per cent of the net assets of the Company.
Details of borrowings as at 31 December 2003 are shown in note 12 on page 48.
Interest risk profile The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Weighted Weighted average period average Nonfor which interest Fixed Floating interest rate is fixed rate rate rate bearing At 31 December 2003 Years % '000 '000 '000 Assets Sterling 5.31 7.49 45,656 10,644 145,804 US Dollar 1,142 74,464 Euro 4.59 6.19 36,272 10,360 52,412 Other 0.78 8.50 2,410 31 98,854 Total assets 84,338 22,177 371,534 Liabilities Bank loans Japanese Yen 4.63 3.32 85,744 Debenture stock 4.00 1,620 Total liabilities 87,364 Murray International Trust PLC 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Weighted Weighted average period average Nonfor which interest Fixed Floating interest rate is fixed rate rate rate bearing At 31 December 2002 Years % '000 '000 '000 Assets Sterling 5.70 7.71 64,142 3,064 127,390 US Dollar 706 63,305 Euro 5.07 6.54 34,647 138 42,984 Other 1.78 8.50 4,372 390 69,200 Total assets 103,161 4,298 302,879 Liabilities Bank loans Japanese Yen 5.63 3.32 86,105 Debenture stock 4.00 1,620 Total liabilities 87,725 The weighted average interest rate is based on the current yield of each asset, weighted by its market value.
The weighted average interest rate on bank loans is based on the interest rate payable, weighted by the total value of the loans.
The maturity dates of the Companys loans are shown in note 12 to the financial statements.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The fair value of borrowings, taking account of potential penalties on early repayment, has been calculated at 95,026,000 as at 31 December 2003 2002 97,293,000 compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of 87,364,000 2002 87,725,000 note 12.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is based on forward exchange rates at the Balance Sheet date.
All other assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities note 12.
Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Balance Sheet can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
A significant proportion of the Companys borrowings, as detailed in note 12 on page 48, are in foreign currency as at 31 December 2003.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to currency movements on borrowings by using forward foreign currency contracts as a hedge against potential foreign exchange rate movements.
At 31 December 2003 the Company had foreign currency contracts, details of which are listed below.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
