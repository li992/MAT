Pensions The Group operates two funded schemes, which provide benefits based on the final pensionable pay of participating employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The charges are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuations of the schemes were at 6 April 2002.
The valuation of the MFI Group Pension Plan, the principal scheme, showed that the scheme had a market value of assets of 253m at that time and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 95% of the benefits that had accrued to the members, after allowing for agreed changes to members benefits and for future expected increases in earnings.
This deficit, taking into account the pension provision in the consolidated balance sheet see note 20, is being recognised in the profit and loss account over the expected remaining service lives of the members of the scheme.
This deficit will have increased by 27 December 2003 due to the decline in stock market values since April 2002.
The principal actuarial assumptions used are an investment return of 6.75% per annum, rates of salary increase of 3.75% per annum and rates of 2.5% per annum for pensions in payment in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension accrued pre and post 6 April 1987 respectively.
The actuarial assumptions for the previous valuation used for the period to 6 April 2002 are an investment return of 8% per annum, rates of salary increase of 6% per annum and rates up to 5% per annum for pensions in payment.
The total pension charge for the period was 10.5m 2002 10.7m.

Contingent liabilities Company 27 Dec 2003 28 Dec 2002 m m Group VAT registration cross guarantee 15.7 13.2 Members of the Group have assigned UK property leases in the normal course of business.
Should the assignees fail to fulfil any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the Group may be liable for those defaults.
The number of such claims arising to date has been small and the cost, which is charged to profit and loss as it arises, has not been material.
HM Customs & Excise claim In August 2001 the Group introduced an optional insurance-backed structural guarantee on certain items of furniture sold in its UK retail stores.
Value Added Tax VAT on the furniture element of the transaction and Insurance Premium Tax IPT is paid on the sale of these warranties.
An assessment has been raised on the VAT and the relevant tax has been paid to HM Customs & Excise.
The directors have taken extensive legal and taxation advice and this action is being contested vigorously.
The relevant tax, which has been paid, is carried on the balance sheet as a debtor without any provision.
To date, the following amounts have been recorded: Cumulative 2003 2002 2001 m m m m Reduction in VAT 50.0 20.7 22.0 7.3 IPT paid 13.0 5.3 5.6 2.1 External insurance premium expenses 6.5 2.5 2.8 1.2 Reinsurance premium to Group company 10.4 4.2 4.5 1.7 Underwriting profit recognised by Group company 1.0 1.0 Profit taken to profit and loss 21.1 9.7 9.1 2.3 80% of the insurance has been reinsured by the external insurer through the Groups captive insurance company Southon Insurance Limited.
The maximum potential exposure is 50m at the year end, but this would be expected to be offset by the recovery of approximately 13m of insurance premium tax paid on the sale of extended structural guarantees and by any future underwriting profit with Southon Insurance Limited.
Due to the timing of our quarterly VAT payments, 46m of the 50m has been paid to HM Customs & Excise at the year end.
