Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2003 38 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS For the year ended 31 December 2003 6 Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued b Factors affecting tax charge The tax charge is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30 per cent.
The difference is explained below: 2003 2002 million million Group profit on ordinary activities before tax 37.6 45.8 Group profit on ordinary activities before tax @ 30 per cent 11.3 13.7 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 16.0 1.6 Accounting depreciation in excess of tax depreciation 1.5 3.7 Taxable income not credited to profit and loss account 2.2 Allowable deduction not debited to profit and loss account primarily UK petroleum revenue tax 4.2 4.1 Additional charge on ring-fence profits 2.9 Current tax not related to profit before tax primarily UK petroleum revenue tax 14.6 13.4 Overseas tax 5.7 3.4 Current tax charge 36.4 27.1 c Factors that may affect future tax charges No provision has been made for deferred tax where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such gains would become taxable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount not provided is 3.3 million 2002: 3.6 million.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the forseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the forseeable future.
7 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
The diluted earnings per share allows for the full exercise of outstanding share purchase options note 19 and adjusted earnings.
The share numbers quoted below have been adjusted for consolidation of ten Ordinary Shares of five pence each to one Ordinary Share of 50 pence on 12 September 2003, in accordance with the terms of Scheme of Arrangement as detailed in Accounting Policies on page 27.
The share repurchase, under the terms of the Scheme of Arrangement, was at fair value and hence no adjustment to the prior year shares has been made.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Weighted average Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 restated restated restated million million million million pence pence Basic 40.8 22.6 136.0 158.6 30.0 14.2 Convertible capital bonds 2.2 2.7 Outstanding share options 0.2 0.5 3.2 7.1 Diluted 41.0 25.3 139.2 168.4 29.5 14.2 The inclusion of the outstanding share options in the 2003 calculation produces a diluted earnings per share.
In 2002, the inclusion of convertible capital bonds and outstanding share options had no dilutive effect.

Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies but are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the group could realise in the normal course of business.
In the case of the guaranteed senior notes where no market value is readily available, fair value has been determined by discounting the expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

23 Group pension schemes The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits under a defined contribution scheme, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme under the FRS 17 Retirement Benefits valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The last formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2002 using the attained age method and market related funding assumptions.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 7.9 million.
On the method and the assumptions adopted at the time, the assets covered 89 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
During 2003, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 26.0 per cent of pensionable salaries.
Based upon the method and assumption adopted for the valuation after taking into account a lump sum contribution of 0.9 million paid in 2002, the new contribution rate was projected to eliminate the deficit over the future working lifetime of the Schemes active membership.
The ratio of the Schemes assets to its liabilities under the Minimum Funding Requirement MFR was 92 per cent as at 1 January 2002.
The principal financial assumptions adopted for this actuarial valuation were: % Rate of investment return 6.8 pa Rate of salary increases 4.5 pa Rate of pension increases 2.5 pa The following figures have been prepared in compliance with the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of the membership data current as at 31 December 2003.

In practice, the Scheme invests in both equities and bonds and the future funding of the Scheme will continue to have regard to the statutory obligations in respect of the MFR and to conventional funding assessments.
In respect of the former, the Scheme actuary has confirmed his opinion that the ratio of the Schemes assets to its liabilities under the MFR at 31 December 2003 was 100 per cent.
No payments were made in respect of unfunded pensions other than those disclosed in the remuneration report.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the capitalised value as at 31 December 2003 of the future payment projected to be made in respect of the unfunded pensions currently in payment is 0.9 million 2002: 1.6 million.
