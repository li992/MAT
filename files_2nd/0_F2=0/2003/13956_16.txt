ii The fair values of all quoted euro bonds are based on their closing clean market price converted at the spot rate of exchange as appropriate.
iii The fair values of the EIB loans have been calculated by discounting their future cash flows at market rates adjusted to reflect the redemption adjustments allowed under each agreement.
iv The fair values of unquoted debt have been calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows for each instrument at the appropriate market discount rate in the currency of issue in effect at the balance sheet date.
v The fair values of the sterling interest rate swaps, sterling forward rate agreements and sterling interest rate caps have been estimated by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows.
vi The fair values of the sterling interest rate swaptions are estimated using the sterling yield curve and implied volatilities as at 31 March.
vii The fair values of the cross currency interest rate swaps have been estimated by adding the present values of the two sides of each swap.
The present value of each side of the swap is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows for that side, using the appropriate market discount rates for that currency in effect at the balance sheet date.
viii The fair values of the forward contracts and tax equalisation swaps are estimated using market forward exchange rates on 31 March.
ix The fair values of gas futures are the margin calls under those contracts.
x The fair values of weather derivatives have been estimated assuming for water related derivatives a normal water year in several water basins, and for temperature related derivatives a normal daily high temperature of certain cities in the US.

b Employee share schemes The group has six types of share based plans for employees.
Options have been granted and awards made to eligible employees to subscribe for ordinary shares or ADSs in Scottish Power plc in accordance with the rules of each plan.
The ScottishPower Sharesave Schemes are savings related and under normal circumstances share options are exercisable on completion of a three or five year save-as-you-earn contract as appropriate.
The PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan relates to options over ScottishPower ADSs which vest over two or three years, as appropriate.
The Executive Share Option Scheme applied to executive directors and certain senior managers.
However, this Scheme was replaced with the Long Term Incentive Plan and, although it will not affect options already granted, this plan supersedes the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan will vest only if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that certain performance measures related to the sustained underlying financial performance of the group and improvements in customer service standards are achieved over a period of three financial years commencing with the financial year preceding the date an award is made.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option Plan 2001 ExSOP to executive directors and certain senior managers are subject to the performance criterion that the percentage increase in the companys annualised earnings per share, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, be at least 3% adjusted for any increase in the RPI.
The Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP allows eligible employees to make contributions from pre-tax salary to buy shares in ScottishPower which are held in trust Partnership Shares.
These shares are matched by the company Matching Shares and are also held in trust.
At the launch of the ESOP, Free Shares were offered to employees.
The K Plus Plan consists of the K Plus Employee Savings Plan and the K Plus Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
The K Plan Employee Savings Plan is a 401 k based qualified retirement plan designed to provide income during employees retirement.
The K Plus Employee Stock Ownership Plan provides for matching contributions by PacifiCorp based on employees contributions, plus additional discretionary employer contributions made to all eligible employees.
## PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan PSIP are options over ScottishPower ADSs: for the purpose of the table above, ADSs have been converted to ScottishPower shares as follows: one ScottishPower ADS equals four ScottishPower shares.
Eligibility for participation in the ExSOP wasextended during the year to certain senior managers in the US.
Consequently, no new options were granted in the year under the PSIP, nor is it intended to grant any new PSIP optionsin the future.
Options granted under the PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan are over ScottishPower ADSs: for the purpose of the table above, options have been converted to ScottishPower ordinary shares as follows: one ScottishPower ADS equals four ScottishPower ordinary shares.
The US$ ADS option price was converted so that it may be represented in terms of ScottishPower ordinary shares.
The price was further converted at the closing exchange rate on 31 March 2003 to be quoted in pence in the table above.
## Options became exercisable in the proportions of one-third on 9 February 2000, one-third on 9 February 2001 and the remaining one-third on 9 February 2002.
Options became exercisable in the proportions 50% on 11 May 2000 and the remaining 50% on 11 May 2001.
### Options became exercisable in the proportions of one-third on 16 February 2001, one-third on 16 February 2002 and the remaining one-third on 16 February 2003.
#### Options became exercisable in the proportions of one-third on 25 January 2002, one-third on 25 January 2003 and the remaining one-third becomes exercisable on 25 January 2004.
Where reference is made to PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan, this is to identify the scheme under which the options over ScottishPower ADSs have been granted.

d The company applied to the Court of Session the Court to approve a reduction in the share premium account which had previously been approved by the companys shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 January 2002.
On 5 March 2002, the Court approved the reduction of the companys share premium account by 1,500 million.
This amount was transferred to the companys profit and loss account reserve.
The reduction in the share premium account created sufficient distributable reserves to facilitate payment of a dividend in specie to demerge Thus.

a Group pension arrangements Following a review of the groups UK pension arrangements, the ScottishPower Pension Scheme, Manweb Pension Scheme and Southern Water Pension Scheme were closed to new members from 31 December 1998.
The group introduced two new group pension plans for new UK employees effective from 1 January 1999.
The new plans are a defined benefit plan Final Salary LifePlan and a defined contribution plan Money Purchase LifePlan which are open to continuous contract employees aged between 16 and 60.
Following the acquisition of PacifiCorp on 29 November 1999, the associated US pension arrangements are now included in the groups Accounts.
Further details of these US arrangements are given in sub-note f below.
Each of the pension schemes are invested in an appropriately diversified range of equities, bonds, property and private markets.
The broad proportions of each asset class in which the schemes aim to be invested are as follows, however it is important to note that this may vary from time to time as markets change and as cash may be held for strategic reasons.

This scheme was open prior to 1 January 1999 to employees of ScottishPower.
Members are required to contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 5% of pensionable salary.
Scottish Power UK plc meets the balance of cost of providing benefits, and company contributions paid are based on the results of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and are agreed by Scottish Power UK plc and the Scheme Trustees.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the company in a trustee administered fund.
Included in the Scheme assets are 140,400 ScottishPower shares 527,904, based on market value as at 31 March 2003, purchased only as part of a pooled strategy to match the relative weightings in the UK Stock Exchange index.
The pension charge for the year is based on the advice of the Schemes independent qualified actuary and is calculated using the same assumptions as those used at the last formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
The Scheme assets were taken at an adjusted market value at that time.
The amount included in the balance sheet represents the difference between the accumulated excess of the actual contributions paid to the Scheme and the pension accounting charge.
The net pension charge is derived from a regular cost of 19.8% of salaries, offset by a variation credit.
The variation credit is calculated as the assessed surplus updated to allow for significant market changes in the interim period, as adjusted for the balance sheet amount, spread as a fixed percentage of pensionable salaries over nine years.
In the year to 31 March 2002, the net pension charge was set to a minimum of nil where the variation credit exceeded the regular cost less interest.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year were nil, except where required by a business transfer agreement.
Employer contributions have recommenced at the rate of 4.8% of pensionable salaries with effect from April 2003.
The rate is expected to rise on the completion of the 2003 triannual actuarial valuation.
The results will be known in the autumn of 2003 and are likely to lead to an increase in the employer contribution rate.
| ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2002 03 106 Notes to the Group Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2003 continued 28 Pensions continued c Manweb Prior to 1 January 1999, most of the Manweb employees were entitled to join the Manweb Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, which provides pension and other related benefits based on final pensionable salary to employees throughout the Electricity Supply Industry in England & Wales.
The ongoing contributions to the Scheme are based on the results of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and the advice of the Scheme Actuary.
The assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Scheme assets no longer include any ScottishPower shares.
For funding and expensing purposes the Scheme assets are taken at market value plus a smoothing adjustment appropriate at the valuation date.
The regular cost for the year, of 14.6% of pensionable salaries, is based on the advice of the Schemes independent qualified actuary and is calculated using the basis of the 2001 valuation.
The variation credit is calculated as a spreading of the assessed surplus over 14 years.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year ranged between 8.1% and 14.1% for different sections of membership but tending towards the higher rates, or other rates for particular groups or as required by a business transfer agreement.
There are no immediate plans to alter the contributions payable.
d Southern Water The sale of Southern Water to First Aqua Limited First Aqua was concluded on 23 April 2002.
The figures in this note relate purely to the charge arising prior to this date.
There is no impact in respect of pensions on the groups balance sheet as a result of the sale of Southern Water, as the Southern Water Scheme had not given rise to any prepayment or provision at the time of the sale.
Southern Water operated a funded pension scheme.
The Scheme details above relate to the principal defined benefit scheme which covered the majority of the Southern Water employees.
Members were required to contribute to the Scheme at varying rates of pensionable salary depending upon category of membership.
The company met the balance of the cost of the accruing benefits.
Contributions paid were based on the results of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and were agreed by the company and the Scheme Trustees.
For funding and expensing purposes, the scheme assets were taken at market value.
The pension charge for the period, of 10% of pensionable salaries, plus employer augmentation costs, is based on the advice of the schemes independent qualified actuary and is calculated using the same assumptions as at the last actuarial valuation of the scheme.
The variation credit for 2001 02 was calculated as the assessed surplus spread over 17 years.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year were 10% of pensionable salaries, except where required by a business transfer agreement.
Following the sale of Southern Water on 23 April 2002, the sponsorship of the Southern Water Scheme passed to First Aqua, with no further payments due by ScottishPower after that date.
Therefore there are no consequent liabilities in respect of this Scheme.
e Final Salary LifePlan The group operates a funded pension scheme providing defined retirement and death benefits based on final pensionable salary for eligible UK employees of the group.
The assets of the LifePlan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The pension charge for the year, of 11.4% of pensionable salaries, is based on the advice of the LifePlans independent qualified actuary, representing the assessed balance of cost of the accruing benefits after allowing for members contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries.
The same actuarial assumptions have been adopted for both funding and expensing purposes.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year were 11.4% of pensionable salaries, except where required by a business transfer agreement.
There are no planned changes to employer contribution requirements.
f PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates pension plans covering substantially all its employees.
Benefits are based on the employees years of service and final pensionable salary, adjusted to reflect estimated social security benefits.
Pension costs are funded annually by no more than the maximum amount of pension expense which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
The PacifiCorp pensions figures in these Accounts include the unfunded SERP.
PacifiCorp meets the entire cost of accruing benefits under PacifiCorp plans.
The assets for the funded Plan are held in a separate fund.
For funding and expensing purposes, the Plan assets are valued at market levels, and liabilities costed on financial assumptions in line with market return expectations.
The pension charge for the year is based on the advice of the Plans independent qualified actuary.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year were 10.3% of pensionable earnings.
The planned contributions for 2003 04 are expected to increase to 10.5% of pensionable earnings.
PacifiCorp also provides other post-retirement benefits to certain employees.
The group has provided 55.0 million as at 31 March 2003 2002 62.6 million for these benefits.
The related charge for the year was 14.3 million 2002 8.8 million.
Further details of these benefits are disclosed in Note 35. g Additional pension arrangements The group operates an approved defined contribution pension scheme Money Purchase LifePlan for eligible employees.
Contributions are paid by the member and employer at fixed rates.
The benefits secured at retirement or death reflect each employees accumulated fund and the cost of purchasing benefits at that time.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The pension charge for the year represents the defined employer contribution and amounted to 0.1 million.
The group also operates pension arrangements for senior executives, namely the ScottishPower Executive Top-Up Plan for benefits which are held within UK Inland Revenue limits and the Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS for benefits beyond these limits.
The UURBS has no invested assets and the group has provided 9.5 million as at 31 March 2003 2002 9.3 million for the benefit promises which will ultimately be paid by the group.
Further details of the groups pensions arrangements are disclosed in Note 35.

The charge referred to above could still arise, in certain circumstances, before 19 March 2007.
Members of the ScottishPower group have agreed to indemnify Thus Group plc for any such liability, except in circumstances arising without the consent of the ScottishPower group.
Legal proceedings The groups businesses are parties to various legal claims, actions and complaints, certain of which involve material amounts.
Although the group is unable to predict with certainty whether or not it will ultimately be successful in these legal proceedings or, if not, what the impact might be, the directors currently believe that disposition of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the groups consolidated Accounts.

ii PacifiCorp contractual commitments Long-term wholesale sales and purchased power contracts In the US, PacifiCorp manages its energy resource requirements by integrating long-term firm, short-term and spot market purchases with its own generating resources to economically operate the system within the boundaries of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requirements and meet commitments for wholesale sales and retail load growth.
The long-term wholesale sales commitments include contracts with minimum sales requirements of 198.2 million, 166.8 million, 141.2 million, 115.8 million and 89.6 million for the years 2004 to 2008 respectively and 0.7 billion thereafter.
As part of its energy resource portfolio, PacifiCorp acquires a portion of its power through long-term purchases and or exchange agreements which require minimum fixed payments of 244.1 million, 230.2 million, 213.3 million, 231.7 million and 156.5 million for the years 2004 to 2008 respectively, and 1.4 billion thereafter.
Excluded from the minimum fixed annual payments above are commitments to purchase power from several hydro-electric projects under long-term arrangements with public utility districts.
These purchases are made on a cost-of-service basis for a stated percentage of project output and for a like percentage of project annual costs operating expenses and debt service.
PacifiCorp is required to pay its portion of operating expenses and its portion of the debt service, whether or not any power is produced.
The arrangements provide for non-withdrawable power and the majority also provide for additional power, withdrawable by the public utility districts upon one to five years notice.
For 2003, these purchases represented approximately 2.4% of PacifiCorps energy requirements.
At 31 March 2003, PacifiCorps share of long-term arrangements with public utility districts were as follows: Annual Year contract Percentage costs Generating facility expires of output Capacity kw m Wanapum 2009 18.7% 155,444 4.4 Priest Rapids 2005 13.9% 109,602 2.5 Rocky Reach 2011 5.3% 64,297 2.2 Wells 2018 6.9% 59,617 1.4 Total 388,960 10.5 The annual costs include debt service costs of 4.1 million.
PacifiCorps minimum debt service obligation at 31 March 2003 was 5.4 million and for the years 2004 to 2008 are 5.1 million, 4.4 million, 5.8 million, 7.7 million and 7.8 million respectively.
Short-term wholesale sales and purchased power contracts At 31 March 2003, PacifiCorp had short-term wholesale forward sales commitments that included contracts with minimum sales requirements of 138.1 million, 77.6 million and 10.4 million for the years 2004 to 2006 respectively.
At 31 March 2003, short-term forward purchase agreements require minimum fixed payments of 113.0 million, 296.4 million and 19.3 million for the years 2004 to 2006 respectively.
Fuel contracts PacifiCorp has take or pay coal and natural gas contracts that require minimum fixed payments of 163.6 million, 146.7 million, 117.8 million, 97.5 million and 100.4 million for the years 2004 to 2008 respectively, and 589.5 million thereafter.
iii PPM contractual commitments At 31 March 2003, PPM had purchase commitments of 350.0 million of which 284.4 million relates to the years 2004 to 2008.
PPMs contractual commitments primarily consist of electricity and gas purchases made to optimise returns from generation resources and commercial activities.

The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted and the goodwill on the purchase has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years.
The directors have estimated the useful economic life of the goodwill acquired having regard to the economic life of the facility and the duration of the contracts acquired.

In addition, a further exceptional charge of 738.2 million was recognised representing the impairment of goodwill on the acquisition of Southern Water previously written off to reserves.
As a consequence of these charges to profits in the year ended 31 March 2002, there is no further gain or loss required to be recognised for the year ended 31 March 2003 on completion of the sale.

The demerger of Thus was preceded by an open offer of approximately 275 million of new equity shares in Thus which resulted in ScottishPowers equity interest in Thus temporarily increasing from 50.1% to 72.4%, and an increase in goodwill of 34.4 million.
Thus results for the period to 19 March 2002 were reported under discontinued operations in the ScottishPower Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2002 and the prior year.
The demerger of Thus was accounted for as a dividend in specie.

Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal of these entities any goodwill previously taken directly to reserves is then charged in the profit and loss account against the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life.
The goodwill adjustment is made to recognise goodwill previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP as an intangible asset under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, following the introduction of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard FAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets which was effective for the group from 1 April 2002, goodwill arising from the purchase of operating entities should be held as an indefinite lived intangible asset in the balance sheet and is no longer amortised.
Instead goodwill is subject to an impairment test performed at least annually.
The adjustment Amortisation of goodwill for the year ended 31 March 2003 represents the reversal of amortisation of goodwill charged under UK GAAP.
The group has completed its transitional and annual goodwill impairment analysis under FAS 142 and has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.
The following table provides an analysis of goodwill included in the balance sheet under US GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2003 and for the year ended 31 March 2002.
| ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2002 03 115 35 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued 2003 2002 Notes m m Net book value of goodwill capitalised under US GAAP: At 1 April 2,937.7 3,794.1 Acquisition 12.4 Disposal of businesses 680.1 Business combinations a 36.7 Amortisation for the year 172.5 Exchange 235.8 3.8 As at 31 March b 2,677.6 2,937.7 a The Business combinations adjustment of 36.7 million relates to deferred tax provisions recognised on the acquisition of PacifiCorp.
b The net book value of goodwill capitalised under US GAAP is analysed by business segment in the table below: 31 March 31 March 2003 2002 m m UK Division Integrated Generation and Supply 562.9 562.9 US Division PacifiCorp 2,102.3 2,374.8 PPM 12.4 United States total 2,114.7 2,374.8 Total 2,677.6 2,937.7 c The impact of reporting under FAS 142 for the year ended 31 March 2002 would have been to reduce the loss under US GAAP by 172.5 million to 714.5 million 2001 increase earnings by 163.5 million to 550.3 million and to reduce the loss per share under US GAAP by 9.38 pence per share to 38.88 pence per share 2001 increase earnings per share by 8.93 pence per share to 30.06 pence per share.
Business combinations In addition to re-instating the goodwill calculated under UK GAAP as described above, goodwill must also be recalculated in accordance with US GAAP.
This is required due to differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP in the determination of acquisition price and valuation of assets and liabilities at the acquisition date.
The adjustment referred to as Business combinations reflects principally the impact of recalculating the goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Manweb and PacifiCorp under US GAAP.
The Business combinations adjustment of 31.6 million 22.1 million net of tax reflected in the reconciliation of profit loss to US GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2003 represents the difference between UK GAAP and US GAAP in accounting for accruals recognised under UK GAAP when PacifiCorp was acquired.
In cases where traded equity securities are exchanged as consideration, UK GAAP requires the fair value of consideration to be determined at the date the transaction is completed, while US GAAP requires the fair value of such consideration to be determined at the date the acquisition is announced.
ii Disposal of businesses Under UK GAAP the loss on disposal of and withdrawal from Appliance Retailing and the provision for loss on disposal of Southern Water were calculated based on net asset value, together with the goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Under US GAAP the same methodology was applied, however the net asset value under US GAAP differed from that under UK GAAP.
The principal differences relate to the amortisation of goodwill which had been recognised as an intangible asset under US GAAP but had been written off to reserves under UK GAAP and the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets, which is not permitted under US GAAP but is permitted under UK GAAP.
iii US regulatory net assets FAS 71 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation establishes US GAAP for utilities in the US whose regulators have the power to approve and or regulate rates that may be charged to customers.
FAS 71 provides that regulatory assets may be capitalised if it is probable that future revenue in an amount at least equal to the capitalised costs will result from the inclusion of that cost in allowable costs for ratemaking purposes.
Due to the different regulatory environment, no equivalent GAAP applies in the UK.
Under UK GAAP, the groups policy is to recognise regulatory assets established in accordance with FAS 71 only where they comprise rights or other access to future economic benefits which have arisen as a result of past transactions or events which have created an obligation to transfer economic benefits to a third party.
The impact of the application of different accounting policies is that US regulatory assets amounting to 1,007.9 million 2002 1,042.8 million are not recognised under UK GAAP, including deferred excess power costs, certain FAS 133 regulatory balances and certain pension regulatory balances.
Profits under US GAAP are consequently decreased by 121.6 million in 2003 2002 profit increased by 95.3 million.
US regulatory net assets relating to the PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs are discussed in note viii below.
iv Pension costs The fundamental differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP are as follows: a Under UK GAAP, the annual pension charge is determined so that it is a substantially level percentage of the current and expected future payroll.
Under US GAAP, the aim is to accrue the cost of providing pension benefits in the year in which the employee provides the related service in accordance with FAS 87, which requires re-adjustment of the significant actuarial assumptions annually to reflect current market and economic conditions.
b Under UK GAAP, pension liabilities are usually discounted using an interest rate that represents the expected long-term return on plan assets.
Under US GAAP, pension liabilities are discounted using the current rates at which the pension liability could be settled.
c Under UK GAAP, variations from plan can be aggregated and amortised over the remaining employee service lives.
Under US GAAP, variations from plan must be amortised separately over remaining service lives.
d Under UK GAAP, alternative bases can be used to value plan assets.
Under US GAAP, plan assets should be valued at market or at market related values and where the fair market value of the plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation a minimum pension liability is then recognised as a charge to other comprehensive income under the provisions of FAS 87 unless and to the extent that FAS 71 can be applied in which case a pension regulatory asset is recognised.
| ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2002 03 116 Notes to the Group Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2003 continued 35 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued v Impairment on demerger of Thus Under UK GAAP, the demerger dividend was calculated based on the book value of the net assets disposed of as a result of demerger.
Under US GAAP, the demerger dividend was calculated based on the market value of the shares at the demerger date and the difference between this and the book value of net assets disposed of was disclosed as an impairment charge under US GAAP.
vi Revaluation of fixed assets The revaluation of assets is not permitted under US GAAP.
The reconciliation therefore adjusts fixed assets to historical cost and the depreciation charge has been adjusted accordingly.
vii Decommissioning and mine reclamation liabilities Under UK GAAP, future decommissioning costs are provided for, on a discounted basis, generally at the inception of the asset life with a corresponding increase to the cost of the asset.
This increased cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
Under US GAAP, for regulated industries, decommissioning costs are accounted for by depreciating the related tangible fixed asset to a negative amount which equates to the estimated decommissioning costs.
In respect of mine reclamation costs UK GAAP requires the discounted future costs of reclamation to be provided for, with a corresponding increase to the cost of the mine assets.
Under US GAAP, anticipated mine reclamation costs are accrued over the life of the mine asset.
viii PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs Under UK GAAP, PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs were recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account at the date of the announcement of the Plan.
Costs were provided for in accordance with FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Under US GAAP, PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs are accounted for as regulatory assets and are being amortised through the income statement.
Costs have been accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No.
94-3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring and FAS 88 Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.
ix FAS 133 derivative instruments and hedging activities Under UK GAAP derivatives designated as used for non-trading purposes are accounted for on a consistent basis with the asset, liability or position being hedged.
Under US GAAP, the group applies FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by FAS 137 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133 and FAS 138 Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
Effective from 1 April 2002, the group adopted revised FAS 133 guidance issued by the Derivatives Implementation Group under Revised Issue C15 Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Certain Option-Type Contracts in Electricity and Issue C16 Applying the Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception to Contracts that Combine a Forward Contract and Purchased Option Contract.
This new guidance had the effect of including an increased number of the groups contracts within the scope of FAS 133.
The cumulative adjustment to profit under US GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2003 as a result of adopting Revised Issue C15 and Issue C16 was an increase to profit of 228.6 million 141.1 million, net of tax.
FAS 133 requires recognition of all derivatives, as defined in the standard, on the balance sheet at fair value.
Derivatives, or any portion thereof, that are not an effective hedge, are adjusted to fair value through income.
If a derivative qualifies as an effective hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment recognised in income, or are recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged items are recognised in earnings.
The effects of changes in fair value of certain derivative instruments entered into to hedge future retail resource requirements in the groups US regulated business are subject to regulation and therefore are deferred pursuant to FAS 71.
The FAS 133 adjustment included within equity shareholders funds of 66.8 million at 31 March 2003 is offset by a US regulatory net asset of 320.6 million relating to PacifiCorps regulated activities which have been deferred as a regulatory asset under FAS 71.
Contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are excluded from the requirements of FAS 133.
The realised gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the income statement at the contract settlement date.
x Extraordinary item Under UK GAAP, certain costs of early debt repayment have been treated as exceptional interest costs.
Under US GAAP, costs of early debt repayment are classified as extraordinary items.
The tax credit on the extraordinary item was 3.6 million for the year ended 31 March 2002. xi Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, FRS 19 Deferred tax, requires full provision for deferred tax at future enacted rates.
Provision is only made in respect of assets revalued for accounting purposes where a commitment exists to sell the asset at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, full provision for deferred tax is required to the extent that accounting profit differs from taxable profit due to temporary timing differences.
Provision is made based on enacted tax law.
The item Effect of US GAAP adjustments reflects the additional impact of making full provision for deferred tax in respect of adjustments made in restating the balance sheet to US GAAP.
The item Effect of differences in methodology reflects the impact of making full provision for deferred tax under US GAAP compared to UK GAAP.
xii ESOP shares held in trust Under UK GAAP, shares held by employee share ownership trusts are recorded as fixed asset investments at cost less amounts written off.
Under US GAAP, shares held in trust are recorded at cost in the balance sheet as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Details of the groups employee share ownership trusts are set out in Note 17. xiii Cash dividends Under UK GAAP, final ordinary cash dividends are recognised in the financial year in respect of which they are proposed by the Board of Directors.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are not recognised until they are formally declared by the Board of Directors.
| ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2002 03 117 35 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued xiv Earnings loss per share Earnings loss per ordinary share have been calculated by dividing the profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year, based on the following information: 2003 2002 2001 Profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 789.3 887.0 386.8 Basic weighted average share capital number of shares, millions 1,843.9 1,837.8 1,830.3 Diluted weighted average share capital number of shares, millions 1,848.4 1,840.1 1,837.4 Earnings loss per share Earnings per share under US GAAP continuing operations 35.76p 19.15p 13.48p Loss earnings per share under US GAAP discontinued operations 0.60 p 63.60 p 7.65p Loss per share under US GAAP extraordinary item net of tax 0.46 p Earnings loss per share under US GAAP before cumulative adjustment for C15 and C16 2002 FAS 133 35.16p 44.91 p 21.13p Earnings loss per share under US GAAP cumulative adjustment for C15 and C16 2002 FAS 133 7.65p 3.35 p Earnings loss per share under US GAAP 42.81p 48.26 p 21.13p Diluted earnings loss per share Diluted earnings per share under US GAAP continuing operations 35.67p 19.15p 13.43p Diluted loss earnings per share under US GAAP discontinued operations 0.60 p 63.60 p 7.62p Diluted loss per share under US GAAP extraordinary item net of tax 0.46 p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP before cumulative adjustment for C15 and C16 2002 FAS 133 35.07p 44.91 p 21.05p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP cumulative adjustment for C15 and C16 2002 FAS 133 7.63p 3.35 p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 42.70p 48.26 p 21.05p The difference between the basic and the diluted weighted average share capital is wholly attributable to outstanding share options and shares held in trust for the groups Employee Share Ownership Plan.
In accordance with FAS 128 Earnings per Share the diluted loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2002 does not assume the exercise of securities that have an antidilutive effect on the loss per share.
The loss earnings per share detailed above for discontinued operations have been calculated based on US GAAP earnings which are net of 3.0 million 2002 37.0 million, 2001 36.3 million of interest and similar charges and a tax credit of 4.6 million 2002 18.8 million tax charge, 2001 5.8 million tax credit.
The groups charge for interest and similar charges has been allocated between continuing and discontinued operations on the basis of external and internal borrowings of the respective operations.
As permitted under UK GAAP, earnings loss per share have been presented including and excluding the impact of exceptional items and goodwill amortisation to provide an additional measure of underlying performance.
UK GAAP permits the presentation of more than one measure of earnings loss per share provided that all such measures are clearly explained and given equal prominence on the face of the profit and loss account.
In accordance with US GAAP, earnings loss per share have been presented above based on US GAAP earnings loss, without adjustments for the impact of UK GAAP exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
Such additional measures of underlying performance are not permitted under US GAAP.
xv Other Other differences between UK and US GAAP are not individually material and relate to post-retirement benefits other than pensions, capitalisation of finance costs, available-for-sale securities, energy exchange contracts and stock option compensation expense.
UK GAAP permits the use of long-term discount rates in determining the provision for post-retirement benefits other than pensions.
US GAAP requires the use of current market rates.
Under UK GAAP, only interest on debt funding may be capitalised during the period of construction.
Under US GAAP, as applied by regulated electricity utilities, both the cost of debt and the cost of equity applicable to domestic utility properties are capitalised during the period of construction.
Under UK GAAP, obligations under energy exchange contracts are valued based on the forecast cost at the balance sheet date of delivering energy under the contract.
Under US GAAP, for regulated utilities, obligations under energy exchange contracts are valued based on the cost avoided in receiving delivery of energy under the contract.
Available-for-sale securities UK GAAP permits current asset investments to be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
US GAAP requires that such investments, insofar as they are available-for-sale securities, are marked to market with movements in market value being included in other comprehensive income.

As the group applies APB 25 in accounting for its plans, under FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, it has adopted the disclosure only option in relation to its share option schemes.
Had the group determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its share options under FAS 123, the groups profit loss for financial year under US GAAP and earnings loss per share under US GAAP would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts below: 2003 2002 2001 Profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 789.3 887.0 386.8 Reversal of APB 25 stock compensation expense included within the Other adjustment million 3.6 4.4 5.0 Stock compensation expense calculated under FAS 123 million 6.1 7.4 11.2 Pro forma profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 786.8 890.0 380.6 Basic earnings loss per share under US GAAP 42.81p 48.26 p 21.13p Pro forma basic earnings loss per share under US GAAP 42.67p 48.43 p 20.79p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 42.70p 48.26 p 21.05p Pro forma diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 42.57p 48.43 p 20.71p The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 6.3 million 2002 8.6 million, 2001 1.6 million.

There are other GAAP differences, not included in the reconciliations, which would affect the classification of assets and liabilities or of income and expenditure.
The principal items which would have such an effect are as follows: under UK GAAP debt issue costs are deducted from the carrying value of the related debt instrument.
US GAAP requires such costs to be included as an asset under UK GAAP customer contributions in respect of fixed assets are generally credited to a separate deferred income account.
Under US GAAP such contributions are netted off against the cost of the related fixed assets items included as exceptional items under UK GAAP are either classified as extraordinary items or operating items under US GAAP under US GAAP, transmission and distribution costs would be included in cost of sales, and gross profit from continuing operations would be calculated after deducting these expenses under UK GAAP, the investors interest in the turnover and results of a joint venture or associate are disclosed gross.
The investors share of the interest and taxation are disclosed separately as a component of the group interest and taxation lines.
Under US GAAP, the investors interest in the net results of joint ventures and associates is disclosed as a single line in the income statement, net of interest and taxation.
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss Under US GAAP, certain items shown as components of common equity must be more prominently reported in a separate statement as components of comprehensive income loss.
The consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss is set out below: 2003 2002 2001 m m m Profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP after cumulative income adjustment 789.3 887.0 386.8 Other comprehensive income loss Foreign currency translation adjustment 114.1 29.7 671.2 Unrealised loss on available-for-sale securities, net of tax credit of 1.4 million 2002 0.1 million, 2001 4.0 million 2.3 0.1 6.5 Pensions, net of tax credit of 154.1 million 2002 23.6 million 358.8 38.5 Cumulative effect of accounting change 2002 FAS 133, net of tax charge of 261.4 million 421.3 FAS 133 loss on derivative financial instruments recognised in net income, net of tax credit of 0.7 million 2002 47.6 million 1.6 76.6 FAS 133 unrealised gain loss on derivative financial instruments, net of tax charge of 9.5 million 2002 tax credit of 219.9 million 15.4 354.7 Total comprehensive income loss under US GAAP 327.9 965.3 1,051.5 The accumulated balances related to each component of other comprehensive income loss are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 m m m Foreign currency translation adjustment 552.5 666.6 696.3 Unrealised loss on available-for-sale securities, net of tax credit of 3.4 million 2002 2.0 million 5.5 3.2 3.1 Pensions, net of tax credit of 177.7 million 2002 23.6 million 397.3 38.5 Unrealised gain loss on derivative financial instruments, net of tax charge of 2.7 million 2002 tax credit of 6.1 million 3.8 10.0 Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with FRS 1 Revised presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, however, there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, dividends received from joint ventures, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources, and financing.
Under US GAAP, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Cash flows from dividends received from joint ventures, returns on investments and servicing of finance and taxation would be included as operating activities under US GAAP.
Equity dividends paid would be included under financing activities under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents are not offset by bank overdrafts repayable within 24 hours from the date of the advance, as is the case under UK GAAP and instead such bank overdrafts are classified within financing activities.
The consolidated cash flow statement prepared in conformity with UK GAAP is set out on page 84.
In this statement an additional measure, free cash flow, is included which is not an accepted measure under US GAAP.
This measure represents cash flow from operations after adjusting for dividends received from joint ventures, returns on investments and servicing of finance and taxation.
UK investors regard free cash flow as the money available to management annually to be allocated among a number of options including capital expenditure, payments of dividends and the financing of acquisitions.

The difference between the infrastructure renewals depreciation charge and depreciation accounting under US GAAP was not material to profit and equity shareholders funds.
This difference no longer exists following the disposal of Southern Water in April 2002. b Doubtful debts The group provided 36.8 million, 57.5 million and 29.7 million for doubtful debts in 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.
Write-offs against the provision for doubtful debts for uncollectable amounts were 61.2 million, 36.6 million and 26.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.

Investment tax credits for PacifiCorp are deferred and amortised to income over periods prescribed by the groups various regulatory jurisdictions under US GAAP.
d Pensions At 31 March 2003, ScottishPower had six statutorily approved defined benefit pension schemes, one statutorily approved defined contribution scheme and one unapproved scheme.
Benefits under the UK defined benefit plans reflect each employees basic earnings, years of service and age at retirement.
Funding of the defined benefit plans is based upon actuarially determined contributions, with members paying contributions at fixed rates and the employers meeting the balance of cost as determined by the scheme actuaries.
Under the UK defined contribution plan, contributions are paid by the member and employer at a fixed rate.
Benefits under the UK defined contribution plan reflect each employees fund at retirement and the cost of purchasing benefits at that time.

Under FAS 87 a minimum pension liability is then recognised.
This liability was recorded as a non-cash increase of 148.4 million to regulatory assets and 67.1 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Accounting orders were received from the regulatory commissions in Utah, Oregon and Wyoming to classify this charge as a regulatory asset instead of a charge to other comprehensive income.
This increase to regulatory assets will be adjusted in future periods as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation changes.

The cost of post-retirement benefits is accrued over the active service period of employees.
Except for a few groups of former employees, PacifiCorp funds post-retirement benefit expense through a combination of funding vehicles.
Over the period from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003, PacifiCorp made contributions totalling 16.3 million in respect of these arrangements.
These funds are invested in common stocks, bonds and US government obligations.

Decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have reduced the APBO as of 31 March 2003 by 14.3 million 2002 17.1 million, 2001 16.0 million, and the annual net periodic post-retirement benefit costs by 1.2 million 2002 1.2 million, 2001 1.4 million.
Post-employment benefits PacifiCorp provides certain post-employment benefits to former employees and their dependants during the period following employment but before retirement.
The costs of these benefits are accrued as they are incurred.
Benefits include salary continuation, severance benefits, disability benefits and continuation of healthcare benefits for terminated and disabled employees and workers compensation benefits.
The provision for post-employment benefits was 9.5 million at 31 March 2003 2002 13.5 million.
Employee savings and stock ownership plan PacifiCorp has an employee savings and stock ownership plan that qualifies as a tax-deferred arrangement under Section 401 a, 401 k, 409, 501 and 4975 e 7 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Participating US employees may defer up to 20% of their compensation, subject to certain regulatory limitations.
PacifiCorp matches a portion of employee contributions with ScottishPower ADSs, vesting that portion over five years.
PacifiCorp makes an additional contribution of ScottishPower ADSs to qualifying employees equal to a percentage of the employees eligible earnings.
These contributions are immediately vested.
Employer contributions to the savings plan were 10.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2003 2002 14.7 million, 2001 12.2 million.
f Southern Water disposal On 23 April 2002, the group completed the sale of Aspen 4 Limited the holding company of Southern Water plc to First Aqua Limited.
A summary of the net assets disposed of calculated under US GAAP are detailed in the table below: m Tangible fixed assets 2,474.7 Fixed asset investments 1.9 Current assets 193.1 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year 1,053.8 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Loans and other borrowings 100.0 Provisions for liabilities and charges 366.6 Deferred income 37.4 Net assets 1,111.9 g Environmental, decommissioning and mine reclamation costs The groups mining operations in the US are subject to reclamation and closure requirements.
Reclamation and closure costs are estimated based on engineering studies.
The group monitors these requirements and periodically revises its cost estimates to meet existing legal and regulatory requirements of the various jurisdictions in which it operates.
The group believes that it has adequately provided for its reclamation obligations, assuming ongoing operations of its mines.
Total estimated final reclamation costs, including joint owners portions, for all mines with which the group is involved was 136.0 million at 31 March 2003.
These amounts are expected to be paid over the next 30 years.
The liabilities for environmental, decommissioning and mine reclamation costs are generally recorded on an undiscounted basis.
These liabilities are recorded in the UK GAAP balance sheet within Provisions for liabilities and charges, and balances under US GAAP are detailed below: Balance sheet liability 31 March 31 March 2003 2002 Notes m m Environmental costs i 35.7 39.5 Decommissioning costs ii 12.3 13.2 Mine reclamation costs iii 92.9 102.4 Total costs 140.9 155.1 i Expected to be paid over 19 years.
ii Expected to be paid over 22 years.
iii Amounts include the groups and joint owners portion of mine reclamation costs.
The group had trust fund assets of 43.3 million and 57.0 million at 31 March 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to mine reclamation, including joint owners portions.
h Leveraged leases The pre-tax loss income from leveraged leases during the year was 27.8 million 2002 4.2 million, the tax credit charge on the pre-tax loss income was 10.7 million 2002 1.4 million and the investment tax credit recognised in the income statement was 0.9 million 2002 1.0 million.
i Commitments and contingencies i Environmental issues UK businesses The groups UK businesses are subject to numerous regulatory requirements with respect to the protection of the environment, including environmental laws which regulate the construction, operation and decommissioning of power stations, pursuant to legislation implementing environmental directives adopted by the EU and protocols agreed under the auspices of international bodies such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The group believes that it has taken and continues to take measures to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment.
Applicable regulations and requirements pertaining to the environment change frequently, however, with the result that continued compliance may require material investments, or that the groups costs and results of operation are less favourable than anticipated.
| ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2002 03 124 Notes to the Group Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2003 continued 35 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued US Division PacifiCorp PacifiCorp is subject to numerous environmental laws including: the Federal Clean Air Act, as enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency and various state agencies: the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments: the Endangered Species Act of 1973, particularly as it relates to certain potentially endangered species of fish: the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, relating to environmental cleanups: along with the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and Clean Water Act relating to water quality.
These laws could potentially impact future operations.
For those contingencies identified at 31 March 2003, principally Clean Air matters, which are the subject of discussions with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and state regulatory authorities, future costs relating to these matters may be significant and consist primarily of capital expenditures.
However, PacifiCorp expects these costs will be included within rates and, therefore, are not expected to have a material impact on the groups results and financial position.
ii Mine reclamation US Division PacifiCorp All of PacifiCorps mining operations are subject to reclamation and closure requirements.
Compliance with these requirements could result in higher expenditures for both capital improvements and operating costs.
iii Deferred net power costs US Division PacifiCorp At 31 March 2003, PacifiCorp had deferred net power costs for the states of Utah, Oregon and Idaho.
While PacifiCorp is pursuing full recovery of these costs, there can be no assurance that this will be achieved.
Denial of recovery would result in the write-off of 87.2 million of deferred net power costs net of amortisation, under US GAAP, reported under US regulatory assets in the UK US GAAP reconciliation of equity shareholders funds.
iv Regulation US Division PacifiCorp The Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB concluded in 1997 that FAS 71 should be discontinued when detailed legislation or regulatory orders regarding competition are issued.
Additionally, the EITF concluded that regulatory assets and liabilities applicable to businesses being deregulated should be written-off unless their recovery is provided through future regulated cash flows.
PacifiCorp continuously evaluates the appropriateness of applying FAS 71 to each of its jurisdictions.
At 31 March 2003, the group concluded that FAS 71 was appropriate.
However, if efforts to deregulate progress, the group may in the future be required to discontinue its application of FAS 71 to all or a portion of its business.
Based on the groups US regulatory net asset balance under US GAAP at 31 March 2003, if the group stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated US operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary loss, after tax, of 580.8 million under US GAAP.
v Hydro-electric relicensing US Division PacifiCorp Approximately 97% of the installed capacity of PacifiCorps hydro-electric portfolio is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission through 20 individual licences.
Nearly all of PacifiCorps hydro-electric projects are at some stage of relicensing under the Federal Power Act.
Hydro-electric relicensing and the related environmental compliance requirements are subject to uncertainties.
PacifiCorp expects future costs relating to these matters may be significant and consist primarily of additional environmental requirements.
The group has accumulated approximately 38.2 million in costs for ongoing hydro-electric relicensing and it is expected that these and other future costs will be included in rates, and as such, will not have a material adverse impact on the groups results and financial position under US GAAP.
j Guarantees In accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
45 FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others: an Interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No.
34, the group is required to disclose certain guarantees as defined in FIN 45.
These guarantees principally relate to the groups disposal of its former operations and are typical of these types of transactions.
Furthermore, disclosure is required under FIN 45 of guarantees even where the likelihood that a liability will crystallise is remote.
FIN 45 also requires recognition of liabilities under US GAAP of the fair value of certain guarantees issued or modified after 31 December 2002.
No such guarantees have been identified.
The disclosures required to be made under FIN 45 are detailed below: The group has entered into a number of transactions involving the sale of parts of its business and the purchase of certain businesses and assets in accordance with overall group strategy.
These transactions include the disposal of Southern Water, the demerger of Thus plc, the sale and disposal of the groups Appliance Retailing business and the disposal of other non-core activities.
It is standard practice in such transactions to obtain or grant contractual assurances, including in the form of warranties and indemnities.
In conducting merger, disposal or acquisition transactions the group takes significant steps to quantify and mitigate risk at the outset of any transaction and as the transaction progresses.
Steps include carrying out, or granting the facility for the conduct of, a thorough due diligence exercise to ascertain any likely liabilities and, where the group is the vendor, the use of caps and threshold levels for liability, inserting time limits on claim periods and detailed disclosure.
Under certain of the business disposals, indemnities under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 the Regulations are still outstanding.
These indemnities relate to potential liabilities with respect to former employees of the group in relation to their period of employment in the group.
Typically there is no maximum limit on claims under these indemnities.
Recourse via tax warranties and indemnities remains outstanding on the same basis as stated above and in relation to the disposal of ScottishPower Telecommunications Services Limited, a former subsidiary of Thus plc.
The maximum financial exposure under these arrangements is 7.5 million.
No claims have been intimated in relation to this arrangement and the directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under this arrangement.
On 23 April 2002, the group sold Aspen 4 Limited, the owner of the Southern Water group of companies.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give assurances, in the form of warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
In relation to this transaction the warranty liability period commenced on 23 April 2002 and ends on 23 April 2007 for environmental warranties, 23 April 2009 for tax warranties and 23 April 2004 for all other warranties.
The sale and purchase agreement contains a number of limitations to and exclusions of liability and maximum financial exposure for breach of the warranties apart from tax warranties is capped at 900.0 million.
For the tax warranties the maximum exposure is approximately 1,950.0 million.
There are also minimum threshold claim levels to be reached before a potential claim arises at all and thereafter as to whether it can be made.
The directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under these arrangements as a detailed due diligence exercise was carried out pre-disposal and detailed disclosures were made to the purchaser so as to make them aware of all relevant information concerning the business and, consequentially, to reduce the likelihood of claims being made against the group.
On 8 October 2001, certain business and assets of the groups former Appliance Retailing business were sold and the remainder of the business was closed.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give assurances in the form of certain warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
In relation to this transaction the warranty liability period commenced on 8 October 2001 and ends on the earlier of 8 October 2003 or, with respect to the sale of the shares, the date of receipt by the purchaser of audited accounts for the groups former subsidiary, Domestic Appliance Insurance Limited DAIL for the year ended 31 March 2002.
Maximum financial exposure for breach of the other warranties is 10.0 million.
Protection relating to DAIL was given in relation to any shortfall in the provisions for claims for which DAIL was liable under the Cashback warranty scheme.
For the tax warranties and cashback indemnity the limit is 75.0 million.
Certain threshold levels must be exceeded before claims can be made against the group.
Although a potential claim has been received with respect to the adequacy of the cashback provisions in the DAIL accounts and discussions have taken place with respect to such a claim the directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under these arrangements.
Indemnities were also given in respect of any liability arising in relation to the Regulations for employment claims prior to 8 October 2001, long-term sick employees and employees who are deemed to transfer pursuant to the Regulations but were not disclosed as transferring employees.
Under the transaction a number of properties were assigned to the purchaser.
By operation of law and through the putting in place of standard agreements in the event that the purchaser becomes insolvent the liability for rent and certain other items due under certain lease arrangements could revert to the group.
The annual liability to the group for rental payments in the event of insolvency of the purchaser is approximately 9.0 million.
It is extremely unlikely that the group would become liable to this extent as steps would be taken to mitigate any such liability which could include surrendering leases to landlords and putting in place new tenants to take over the liability.
| ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2002 03 125 35 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued On 3 August 2000, the group agreed to sell Powercor Australia Ltd.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give certain warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
The group agreed to indemnify the purchaser for any breaches of representations relating to tax warranties or tax claims as defined therein until August 2005.
The indemnity is limited by a AUD$15.0 million 5.7 million basket, with the group liable for the excess over this amount only and an overall cap of AUD$300.0 million 114.5 million.
No claims have been intimated in relation to the above noted arrangements and the directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under these arrangements.
In November 2000, the group sold its interests in Hazelwood Holdings Inc. and PacifiCorp Global Inc.
In relation to this transaction the tax warranty period commenced in November 2000 and ends in November 2005.
The maximum financial exposure for breach of these warranties is AUD$88.0 million 33.6 million.
The directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure under these arrangements as a detailed due diligence exercise was carried out pre-disposal and detailed disclosures were made to the purchaser to reduce the likelihood of claims being made against the group.
To the extent that claims based upon the arrangements below are limited by applicable statutes, the limitation periods generally vary from three to six years, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the claim.
On 22 July 2000, a subsidiary company, PacifiCorp Trans, Inc. PacifiCorp Trans sold two Cessna Citation Excel aircraft for US$16.6 million 10.5 million, and agreed to indemnify the purchaser for any claims asserted against the purchaser in connection with the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by PacifiCorp Trans.
On 4 May 2000, the group and other joint owners completed the sale to Transalta of a power plant and coal mine located in Centralia, Washington.
Under the agreement relating to the plant, the joint owners agreed to indemnify Transalta if it were to incur certain losses after the closing date and arising as a result of certain breaches of covenants.
Under the agreement relating to the mine, the group provided similar indemnity.
The maximum indemnification obligation under these agreements, with respect to the group, is limited to $556.0 million 351.7 million, less a deductible of 1% of the purchase price approximately $1.0 million 0.6 million.
No indemnity claims have been made to date.
"In connection with the sale of PacifiCorp's Montana service territory, PacifiCorp entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Flathead Electric Cooperative ""Flathead"" dated 9 October 1998."
Under the agreement, PacifiCorp indemnified Flathead for losses, if any, occurring after the closing date and arising as a result of certain breaches of warranty or covenants.
The indemnification has a cap of $6.0 million 4.0 million.
One indemnity claim relating to environmental issues has been tendered, but remediation costs for this claim, if any, are not expected to create a material financial exposure for the group.
On 15 October 2001, the group sold its synthetic fuels operation.
The group agreed to indemnify the purchaser from losses suffered as a result of fraud or breach of representation or warranty, within 30 days of the expiration of the applicable statutory period of limitations.
The established basket and cap do not apply to the surviving representations and warranties.
The group also agreed to indemnify the purchaser for tax liabilities up to the closing date: this indemnity also expires within 30 days of the expiration of the statutory period of limitations.
"On 11 June 1997, PacifiCorp Group Holdings Company PGHC, a subsidiary of the company, sold Pacific Telecom, Inc. ""PTI""."
PGHC agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the purchaser from losses or claims arising from breach of representation or warranty of PGHC resulting from any liability of PTI with respect to tax years ending prior to the closing date: and resulting from material breaches of agreements and covenants under the agreement.
The indemnity includes a $5.0 million 3.2 million basket, with the group being liable for the excess over this amount only and an overall cap of $300.0 million 189.7 million.
Most of the indemnities survive for six months beyond the applicable statute of limitations.
PGHC is currently defending one environmental indemnity claim under this provision and apart from this no claims have been intimated in relation to the above noted arrangements.
On 10 October 1997, PGHC agreed to sell Pacific Generation Company.
The group agreed to indemnify the purchaser for breaches of representations and warranties relating to tax matters, which continue until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
The indemnity includes an aggregate cap of $66.0 million 41.7 million and a basket of $3.0 million 1.7 million.
On 9 February 1999, PGHC agreed to sell TPC Corporation.
The group provided indemnification to the purchaser for breaches of representations and warranties relating to environmental matters, tax matters and employee benefits for the period ending 9 February 2004 with regard to the environmental matters, and through the applicable statute of limitations on tax and employee benefit matters.
The indemnification is limited to a $1.0 million 0.6 million basket, with the group liable for the excess over this amount only and an overall $10.0 million 6.3 million cap.
In addition, certain special indemnities were provided with respect to certain specified matters.
ScottishPower Energy Retail Limited SPERL has entered into an agreement with Lloyds TSB in relation to energy marketing and services.
This agreement contains indemnities in relation to transfer of staff by operation of the Regulations from SPERL to Lloyds TSB.
The maximum liability is limited to 5.0 million.
No claims have been intimated.
Under certain cash collateral agreements, Automated Power Exchange UK Limited, UK Power Exchange and Elexon can draw down and use cash collateral in event of default situations including upon a change in credit rating.
The maximum financial exposure under these arrangements is 10.3 million.
Under the groups arrangements carried out in accordance with the standard terms and conditions of the International Swap Dealers Association Inc ISDA Master Agreement there is a provision that the group will indemnify the counter-party for certain withholding taxes incurred under relevant tax laws.
A liability under this indemnification will only arise on the occurrence of certain changes to tax laws in the jurisdiction of a relevant counterparty.
The directors are not aware of any such contemplated changes.
k Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The group uses derivative instruments in the normal course of business, to offset fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and equity associated with movements in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by FAS 137 and FAS 138, was adopted by the group with effect from 1 April 2001.
FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities.
FAS 133 requires that an entity recognise all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
FAS 133 prescribes requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships and ongoing assessments of effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed consistently with the method and risk management strategy documented for each hedging relationship.
On at least a quarterly basis, the group assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship retrospectively and prospectively to ensure that hedge accounting was appropriate for the prior period and continues to be appropriate for future periods.
The group applies the short cut method of assessing effectiveness when possible.
The group considers hedge accounting to be appropriate if the assessment of hedge effectiveness indicates that the change in fair value of the designated hedging instrument is 80% to 125% effective at offsetting the change in fair value arising on the hedged risk of the hedged item or transaction.
The effect of changes in fair value of certain derivative instruments entered into to hedge PacifiCorps future retail resource requirements are subject to regulation in the US and therefore are deferred pursuant to FAS 71.
PacifiCorp requested and received deferred accounting orders for the effects of FAS 133 as it relates to the change in value of certain long-term wholesale electricity contracts not meeting the definition of normal purchases and normal sales contracts.
| ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2002 03 126 Notes to the Group Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2003 continued 35 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued Categories of derivatives Derivatives are classified into four categories: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, overseas net investment hedges and trading.
If a derivative instrument qualifies as a fair value hedge the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of hedged risk arising on the hedged item is recorded in earnings.
The corresponding change is recorded against the book values of the derivative and hedged item on the balance sheet.
If a derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the hedging instruments gain or loss is reported in shareholders funds under US GAAP as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognised in earnings in the period during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings.
The ineffective portion of the derivatives fair value change is recorded in earnings.
For derivative instruments designated as a hedge of the foreign currency risk in an overseas net investment, gains or losses due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within shareholders funds under US GAAP as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
If a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a net investment hedge or a cash flow hedge under the applicable guidance, the change in the fair value of the derivative is immediately recognised in earnings or as an adjustment to the FAS 71 regulatory asset as appropriate.
Derivative instruments are not generally held by the company for speculative trading purposes.
To the extent such instruments are held they are measured at fair value with gains or losses recorded in earnings.
The fair value of trading derivatives at 31 March 2003 was 0.4 million.
Certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133 may qualify as a normal purchase or a normal sale and be excluded from the scope of FAS 133.
Specific criteria must be met in order for a contract that would otherwise be regarded as a derivative to qualify as a normal purchase or a normal sale.
The group has evaluated all commodity contracts to determine if they meet the definition of a derivative and qualify as a normal purchase or a normal sale.
The group also evaluates contracts for embedded derivatives, and considers whether any embedded derivatives have to be separated from the underlying host contract and accounted for separately in accordance with FAS 133 requirements.
Where embedded derivatives have terms that are not clearly and closely related to the terms of the host contract in which they are included, they are accounted for separately from the host contract as derivatives, with changes in the fair value recorded in earnings, to the extent that the hybrid instrument is not already accounted for at fair value.
Discontinued hedge accounting When hedge accounting is discontinued due to the groups determination that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the group will continue to carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value.
The related hedged asset or liability will cease to be adjusted for changes in fair value relating to the previously hedged risk.
When the group discontinues hedge accounting in a cash flow hedge because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the expected period, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognised in earnings.
Where a derivative instrument ceases to meet the criteria for hedge accounting, any subsequent gains and losses are recognised in earnings.
Fair value hedges The group seeks to maintain a desired level of floating rate debt, and uses interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from long-term debt obligations denominated in sterling and foreign currencies.
The group does not exclude any component of derivative gains and losses from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
The ineffective portion of fair value hedges as at 31 March 2003 resulted in a loss of 0.2 million.
Cash flow hedges A desired level of fixed rate debt is maintained through the use of interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency forward contracts are used to fix the exchange rate on future contracted purchases of assets.
These transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The group does not exclude any component of derivative gains and losses from the assessment of ineffectiveness.
The amount of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges recorded for the year ended 31 March 2003 was nil.
Net realised losses on cash flow hedges totalling 13.9 million were transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income into income during the year to match the underlying hedged items recognised in the income statement.
The group estimates that losses of 5.7 million on cash flow hedges in place at the year end will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income into income during 2003 04.
Net investment hedges The group uses foreign currency forwards and cross currency swaps to protect the value of its investments in operations denominated in foreign currencies.
The group excludes the spot-forward difference from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
In the year ended 31 March 2003 the group recorded a 158.8 million translation adjustment gain related to net investment hedges.
Recent US accounting pronouncements In June 2001 the FASB issued FAS 143 'Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations' which became effective for the group on 1 April 2003.
The statement requires the fair value of an asset retirement obligation to be recorded as a liability in the period in which the obligation was incurred.
At the same time the liability is recorded, the costs of the asset retirement obligation must be recorded as an addition to the carrying amount of the related asset.
Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the addition to the carrying amount is depreciated over the asset's useful life.
Upon retirement of the asset, the group will settle the retirement obligation against the recorded balance of the liability.
Any difference in the financial retirement obligation cost and the liability will result in either a gain or loss.
The group has considered the application of this standard to its operations and has completed an assessment of the impact of this standard.
The group estimates that the cumulative post-tax effect of adopting FAS 143 will increase net income under US GAAP by 1.7 million, which will be recorded primarily as a net US net regulatory liability if PacifiCorp receives regulatory approval.
In April 2002, the FASB issued FAS 145, 'Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4,44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.
FAS 145 became effective for the group on 1 April 2003.
This statement is not expected to have a material impact on the group's results and financial position under US GAAP.
In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognised when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of the companys commitment to the exit plan.
FAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after 31 December 2002 and therefore has had no effect on the groups results and financial position under US GAAP.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FAS Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after 31 January 2003 and applies to accounting periods beginning after 15 June 2003 to variable interest entities acquired before 1 February 2003.
This interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the groups results and financial position under US GAAP.
In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
FAS 149 amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities.
This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after 30 June 2003.
The group is currently evaluating the effect FAS 149 will have on its results and financial position under US GAAP.
