With the exception of the US$ denominated unsecured loan notes, all sterling financial liabilities have a market value equivalent to the book value as the underlying interest costs are at variable market rates.
The fair value of the US$ denominated unsecured loan notes has been calculated by discounting the underlying cash flows and using the year-end exchange rate to convert the US$ value to sterling.
d Currency profile The Group has no material foreign currency exposures as the US$22.8 million, U$350 million and US$252 million unsecured loan notes detailed in note 19 are hedged through cross-currency interest rate swaps.

24 Pensions The Group operates a number of funded final salary pension schemes including two executive arrangements, all of which have been set up under Trusts that hold their financial assets separately from those of the Group.
In addition, a number of defined contribution arrangements are currently operated, however, the cost of these is immaterial and is not separately disclosed within the pension costs for the Group.
Two of the schemes, namely the Mirror Group Pension Scheme the Old Scheme and the MGN Past Service Pension Scheme the Past Service Scheme cover the liabilities in respect of service up to 13 February 1992, the date when the Old Scheme was closed.
The Past Service Scheme was established to meet the liabilities for service up to 13 February 1992 for employees and former employees, who worked regularly on the production and distribution of Mirror Groups newspapers, which are not satisfied by payments from the Old Scheme and the Maxwell Communications Pension Plan or by the State.
An actuarial valuation of these pension schemes as at 31 December 2002 showed that they have insufficient assets to meet their liabilities for members benefits, therefore contributions of 3.5 million were paid to the Past Service Scheme in 2003 with the same amount to be paid in 2004.
In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a further eight final salary schemes.
Formal valuations of schemes are carried out regularly, the actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate each schemes assets and liabilities varying according to the actuarial and funding policies adopted by their respective trustees.
Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Pensions continued The most significant of the schemes are the Trinity Retirement Benefit Scheme the Trinity Scheme, the MGN Pension Scheme the MGN Scheme and the Midland Independent Newspapers Pension Scheme the MIN Scheme, which together with the Old Scheme and the Past Service Scheme represent over 95% of the aggregate market value.
The last formal valuation of these schemes was undertaken on 30 June 2001 for the Trinity Scheme, 31 December 2002 for the MGN Scheme and 31 March 2002 for the MIN Scheme.
These valuations showed surpluses of 44.4 million and 0.3 million in the Trinity and MIN Schemes respectively and a deficit of 25.2 million in the MGN Scheme.
All of the schemes are being funded in accordance with the recommendations of the respective actuaries.
In 2004, employers contributions to the MGN Scheme have been increased by 1.1% to 11.1%.
A valuation of the Trinity Scheme is being carried out which will lead to an increase in contributions.
The Company has agreed with the Trustee to increase the contribution rate from 9% to 14%.
During 2002, the decision was taken to close entry to the three final salary pension schemes to new employees with effect from 1 January 2003.
Existing staff who were eligible to join a final salary scheme had until 28 February 2003 to apply.
All new employees, after 1 January 2003, are entitled to participate in a new defined contribution plan, known as the Trinity Mirror Pension Plan, which was introduced on 1 July 2003.
Valuations have been performed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 as at 31 December 2003.
Scheme liabilities have been calculated using a consistent projected unit valuation method and compared to the schemes assets at the 28 December 2003 market value.
