The standard requires that earnings should be based on the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders.
The calculation for earnings, including and excluding net loss on disposal of xed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation, is based on the profit for the financial year of 946m 2002 830m.
For the purposes of calculating earnings per share, the number of shares is the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 6,989 million 2002 6,887 million.
The calculation for diluted earnings per share uses the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
The calculation compares the difference between the exercise price of exercisable ordinary share options, weighted for the period over which they were outstanding, with the average daily mid-market closing price over the period.

NOTE 25 Share options Company schemes The company had six principal share option schemes in operation during the year: i The savings-related share option scheme 1981 permits the grant to employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 250 per four-weekly period.
Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three and five-year period at a subscription price not less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an ordinary share immediately prior to the date of grant.
ii The Irish savings-related share option scheme 2000 permits the grant to Irish employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 12 and 320 per four-weekly period.
Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three and five-year period at a subscription price not less than 75% of the middle-market quotation of an ordinary share immediately prior to the date of grant.
iii The executive share option scheme 1984 permitted the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
The scheme expired after ten years on 9 November 1994.
Options were generally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at a subscription price determined by the Board but not less than the middle-market quotation within the period of 30 days prior to the date of grant.
Some options have been granted at a discount of 15% of the standard option price but the option holder may take advantage of that discount only if, in accordance with investor protection ABI guidelines, certain targets related to earnings per share are achieved.
TESCO PLC 45 NOTE 25 Share options continued iv The executive share option scheme 1994 was adopted on 17 October 1994.
The principal difference between this scheme and the previous scheme is that the exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over any three-year period.
There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme.
v The unapproved executive share option scheme 1996 was adopted on 7 June 1996.
This scheme was introduced following legislative changes which limited the number of options which could be granted under the previous scheme.
As with the previous scheme, the exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over any three-year period.
vi The international executive share option scheme was adopted on 20 May 1994.
This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from their grant at a price of not less than the average of the middlemarket quotations for the ordinary shares for the three dealing days immediately preceding their grant and will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target determined by the Remuneration Committee when the options are granted.
The company has granted outstanding options in connection with the six schemes as follows: Savings-related share option scheme 1981 Number of Shares executives and under option Subscription Date of grant employees 22 Feb 2003 price pence 31 October 1996 7 19,944 83.0 30 October 1997 1,263 2,348,730 121.7 29 October 1998 15,233 29,129,809 136.0 28 October 1999 18,677 21,942,961 151.0 26 October 2000 54,115 39,329,167 198.0 8 November 2001 57,489 43,425,170 198.0 8 November 2002 63,366 61,702,691 159.0 Irish savings-related share option scheme 2000 Number of Shares executives and under option Subscription Date of grant employees 22 Feb 2003 price pence 2 June 2000 1,744 1,766,497 163.0 26 October 2000 774 586,659 198.0 8 November 2001 711 598,231 198.0 8 November 2002 1,233 1,261,577 159.0 Tesco PLC has taken advantage of the exemptions applicable to Inland Revenue-approved SAYE share option schemes and equivalent overseas schemes under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 revised 2000, Employee Share Schemes.
FRS 17, Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 but is not expected to be fully mandatory for the Group until the year ending February 2006.
Prior to this, transitional disclosures are required which, to the extent they are not given in note a, are set out in note b.
The full actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2002 forms the basis of future funding decisions.
The Company has reviewed the results of the subsequent FRS 17 valuation and does not consider that any additional funding is required at this time.
a Pension commitments United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme which is a funded dened benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
The total profit and loss charge of UK schemes to the Group during the year was 114m 2002 97m.
A SSAP 24 pension prepayment of 6m 2002 3m is present in the Group balance sheet.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme at 31 March 2002.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries and pensions.
The key assumptions made were a rate of return on investments of 6.75%, a rate of increase in salaries of 4% and a rate of increase in pensions of 2.5%.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation, the market value of the schemes assets was 1,576m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 91% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The actuarial shortfall of 159m will be met via increased contributions over a period of ten years, being the expected average remaining service lifetime of employed members.
The next actuarial valuation is due at 31 March 2005.
The T&S Stores PLC Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded dened benefit scheme open to senior executives and certain other employees at the invitation of the company.
At the latest actuarial valuation at 6 April 2001, the market value of the schemes assets was 5.8m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 110% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Overseas The Group operates a number of schemes worldwide, the majority of which are dened contribution schemes.
The contributions payable for non-UK schemes of 8m 2002 7m have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
A dened benefit scheme operates in the Republic of Ireland.
At the latest actuarial valuation at 1 April 2001, the market value of the schemes assets was 55m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 123% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
b FRS 17, Retirement Benets The valuations used for FRS 17 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 22 February 2003.
Schemes assets are stated at their market values at 22 February 2003.
Buck Consultants Ireland Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation.
The liabilities relating to post-retirement healthcare benets note 27 have also been determined in accordance with FRS 17, and are incorporated in the numbers below.

The equities held in the schemes have been subject to significant market uctuations and the reduction in share values accounts for the majority of the difference between the actual and expected return on assets.

The cost of providing these benets has been accounted for on a similar basis to that used for dened benefit pension schemes.
The liability as at 22 February 2003 of 6.6m, which was determined in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries, is being spread forward over the service lives of relevant employees.
0.5m has been charged to the profit and loss account and 0.5m of benets were paid.
An accrual of 5.3m 2002 5.3m is being carried in the balance sheet.

The following tables set out the effect of the material acquisitions of the Group companies in the year to 22 February 2003 on the consolidated balance sheet.
Other acquisitions made in the year are not considered to be material and the effects on the consolidated balance sheet have been disclosed in aggregate.
Acquisition accounting has been applied in all cases.
The fair values currently established for all acquisitions made in the year to 22 February 2003 are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisitions to the year end.
Fair values will be reviewed based on additional information up to 28 February 2004.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such a review would have a material effect on the Group.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years.
HIT HIT was acquired on 1 September 2002 and included in the consolidated balance sheet at 22 February 2003.
The net assets of HIT on acquisition and the provisional fair values were as follows: Adjustments Book values to align Fair values of acquired accounting at date of business policies Revaluations acquisition m m m m Fixed assets 106 13 119 Stock 16 1 15 Debtors 6 7 1 12 Cash 99 Creditors 46 5 51 Provisions for liabilities and charges 13 13 Net assets acquired 91 7 7 91 Consideration Cash 400 Goodwill 309 The principal fair value adjustments made to the net book values of the assets and liabilities of HIT were the creation of a 7m deferred tax asset to align accounting policies, a 13m revaluation of xed assets and a 13m provision for an onerous lease commitment.
For the year ended 31 December 2001, HIT reported an audited profit after tax and minority interest of 7m.
For the period ended 31 August 2002, the unaudited post-tax loss was 8m based on its then accounting policies.

Adjustments have also been made to align accounting policies for tangible xed assets and stock.
Deferred tax has been provided on these adjustments where appropriate.
For the year ended 31 December 2001, T&S Stores PLC reported an audited profit after tax and minority interest of 24m and for the period ended 5 January 2003, an unaudited provisional loss after tax and minority interest of 11m, based on its then accounting policies.
Of the provisions for liabilities noted in the tables above, nil was provided by HIT for reorganisation in the year up to acquisition, and nil provided by T&S Stores PLC.
Other acquisitions In respect of other acquisitions in the year, the book value of net assets acquired was 5m.
In the Directors opinion, the book value of the net assets acquired is not materially different from their fair value.
Total consideration was 17m, of which 12m was cash.
This resulted in goodwill of 12m.
