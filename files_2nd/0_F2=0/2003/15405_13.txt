Tate & Lyle annual report 2003 notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation a Accounting policies The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets, and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
The Groups accounting policies are unchanged compared with the year ended 31 March 2002. b Discontinued activities Discontinued activities represents the results of businesses now sold that were individually significant to their segment and include Western, the US beet sugar producer, and the North American molasses and storage businesses, which were sold in 2003 and Domino, the US cane sugar refiner, the African and Thai sugar assets and the storage businesses in East Africa and the Caribbean which were sold in 2002.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Company has control over its operating and financial policies.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys own profit and loss account is not presented in these financial statements.
An undertaking is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies and an associate if the Group holds a participating interest and has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups profit and loss account includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets shown gross in the case of joint ventures.
Unless stated otherwise, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting whereby the Groups results include the results of the acquired business from the effective date of acquisition.
Where a business is sold, its results are included in the Groups results to the effective date of disposal.
Goodwill Goodwill arises under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the interest acquired by the Group in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
On acquisitions completed after 26 September 1998, goodwill is capitalised and amortised to the profit and loss account over its useful economic life not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is shown within intangible fixed assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in their carrying value on the Groups balance sheet.
On acquisitions completed on or before 26 September 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves and has not been reinstated.
Goodwill not previously recognised in the profit and loss account is taken into account when calculating the profit or loss on the subsequent disposal or termination of acquired businesses.
Sales Sales comprise the amount receivable in the ordinary course of business, net of value added and sales taxes, for goods and services provided.
By-product revenues are credited to the cost of raw materials.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of direct cost together with attributable overheads and net realisable value and is transferred to the profit and loss account on a first in, first out basis.
Tangible fixed assets Certain tangible fixed assets are carried at amounts based upon valuations recognised before the adoption of FRS15 Tangible Fixed Assets.
As is permitted by the transitional provisions of FRS15, these revaluations have not been updated.
Finance costs directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
The depreciation charge is calculated so as to allocate the cost or revalued amount of tangible fixed assets systematically over their remaining useful economic lives using the straight line method.
These asset lives are reviewed at the end of each financial year.
com Tate & Lyle annual report 2003 1 Accounting policies continued The following asset lives are used: Freehold land : No depreciation Freehold buildings : 20 to 50 years Leasehold property : Period of the lease Bulk liquid storage tanks : 12 to 20 years Plant and machinery : 3 to 28 years Leases Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the Groups depreciation policy.
Operating lease costs are charged to profit as incurred.
Research and development All expenditure on research and development is charged to profit as incurred.
Advertising Advertising costs are charged to profit when the advertising first takes place.
Retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and, in the USA, provides retirement healthcare and life assurance benefits.
The expected cost of these arrangements is charged to the profit and loss account, on the advice of actuaries, so as to accrue the cost over the service lives of employees on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the scheme.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on a full provision basis on timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts and their recognition for tax purposes that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences or on timing differences arising on property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to sell the asset, gains on asset sales that are rolled over into replacement assets for tax purposes or on unremitted profits of overseas subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to permit tax relief of the underlying timing differences.
Where appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated on a discounted basis.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the last day of the financial period the closing rate except when they are hedged by an open foreign exchange contract, in which case the rate of exchange specified in the contract is used.
The profits of overseas companies are translated at the annual average of daily exchange rates and the difference when compared with that arising from the use of closing rates, together with differences on exchange arising from the translation of the opening balance sheets of overseas companies at year end rates are taken directly to distributable reserves.
Other profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments and their derivatives Financial instruments and their derivatives are categorised as held for trading or held as hedges.
Financial instruments held for trading The fair value of all instruments held for trading is recognised in the balance sheet and all unrealised profits and losses are taken to operating profit.
com 51 Tate & Lyle annual report 2003 notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments held as hedges All hedging instruments are matched with their underlying hedged item.
Each instruments gain or loss is brought into the profit and loss account and its fair value into the balance sheet, at the same time and in the same place as is the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost.
For foreign exchange and commodity instruments this will be in operating profit matched against the relevant purchase or sale, and for interest rate instruments within interest payable or receivable over the life of the instrument or relevant interest period.
The profit or loss on an instrument may be deferred if the hedged transaction is expected to take place or would normally be accounted for in a future period.
The finance costs of debt instruments are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Such costs include the costs of issue and any discount to face value arising on issue, or any premium payable on maturity.
Differences arising from the movement in exchange rates during the year from the translation to sterling of the foreign currency borrowings and similar instruments used to finance long-term foreign equity investments are taken direct to distributable reserves and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Changes in the fair value of most financial instruments or the underlying hedged item are not usually recognised in the profit and loss account.
However, if unrealised changes in the fair value of the hedged item are included in the profit and loss account, changes in the fair value of the instrument are also included.
Initial margin deposits and variation margin deposits and receipts for futures contracts are included in current assets or current liabilities while the position is open.
Unamortised premiums are also held in similar accounts.
All premiums or fees, paid or received, in respect of a financial instrument are accounted for over the life of the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost, even if the instrument has been sold.
If the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost ceases to exist, or is no longer considered likely to exist in the future, the hedging instrument is sold.
Any profit or loss on the sale is recognised in the profit and loss account as part of operating profit.

Audit fees disclosed above include 0.4 million 2002 0.3 million relating to the audit of Tate & Lyle PLC.
Total fees for worldwide audit-related and non-audit services in 2003 paid to the auditor  LLP PwC were 1.7 million 2002 0.9 million.
Audit-related fees were 0.4 million and non-audit fees were 1.3 million.
We sought assistance with the disposal of the United Molasses business, and after a competitive bidding process awarded this assignment to PwC in 2001.
This was before the implementation of the Groups revised auditor independence policy, with more restricted scope for the provision of non-audit services, as set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 32.
Of the 1.7 million, the disposal assignment cost 1.5 m, of which 0.9 million has been included within the profit on the sale of businesses and 0.6 million included within operating profit, as it related to the part of the business which was ultimately retained.

The facilities may only be withdrawn in the event of specified events of default.
In addition, the Group has substantial uncommitted facilities.
At 31 March 2003, a US subsidiary had an outstanding bank borrowing of US$525 million, the principal amount of which is guaranteed by another Group company by way of letters of credit issued by banks backed by its assets.
The guarantee is such as to make this borrowing in substance non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and accordingly the borrowing and deposit are offset in these accounts.
At 31 March 2003, the same US subsidiary also had outstanding a five-year bank borrowing of US$275 million drawn down in March 2001 in the form of a registered loan note issuance.
Repayment of the loan note is secured on a portfolio of sovereign debt in the same principal amount owned by a third party, the purchase of which was financed indirectly by another Group company subscribing to a five-year loan note which will, in the event of a default, be exchangeable for the US subsidiarys loan note.
In a similar manner to the transaction described in the previous paragraph, the agreements involved are such that this borrowing is in substance non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and accordingly the borrowing and note subscription are offset in these accounts.

com Tate & Lyle annual report 2003 24 Retirement benefits a Retirement benefit schemes The Group maintains pension plans for its operations throughout the world.
Most of these arrangements are defined benefit pension schemes with retirement, disability, death and termination income benefits.
The retirement income benefits are generally a function of years of employment and final salary.
On 1 April 2002, the scheme was closed to new members.
A defined contribution pension scheme has been established to provide pension benefits to new employees.
The principal schemes are funded and their assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The schemes are funded in line with local practice and contributions are assessed in accordance with local actuarial advice.
The schemes operated by the Group are subject to independent actuarial valuation at regular intervals using consistent assumptions appropriate to conditions prevailing in the relevant country.
The Group also maintains defined contribution pension schemes and some fully insured pension schemes and multi-employer pension arrangements.
The Groups subsidiaries in the USA provide unfunded retirement medical and life assurance benefits to their employees.
b Accounting and disclosures The Group accounts for retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pensions and the related disclosures are set out in section c below.
The Group has adopted the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS17 Retirement Benefits.
It differs from SSAP24 principally with regard to the choice of assumptions and in that differences between the market value of the assets and liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are recognised immediately in the balance sheet whereas they are recognised on a smoothed basis through the profit and loss account under SSAP24.
The Group is not required to account for retirement benefits under FRS17 as full implementation has been deferred, but is required to present certain transitional disclosures which are set out in section d below.
c SSAP24 disclosures i Pensions The main scheme is the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme which provides benefits related to service and final salary.
The most recent valuation of the scheme was prepared as at 31 March 2001 by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The method differed from that used previously in that the investments were taken at their market value and the discount rate used to assess the level of the liabilities was set by reference to the expected return on the current market value of the assets.
The principal actuarial assumptions made were that, over the long term, the total return on investments currently held by the scheme will be 5.5% per annum, the total return on future investments will be 6.1% per annum, pensionable salaries will increase at 4.3% per annum and the rate of future retail price inflation will be 2.5% per annum.
Provision was made for pension increases of 2.5% provided under the rules of the scheme.
The valuation showed a surplus which the actuary advised was sufficient to support the continued suspension of contributions.
Overall, at the date of their most recent actuarial valuations, the market value of the assets of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes in surplus was 1,110 million and of those schemes in deficit was 39 million.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 104% and 74% respectively of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for future salary increases.
However, the UK Group scheme actuaries have estimated, for the purposes of SSAP24, that the surplus arising at 31 March 2001 had been replaced by a small deficit by 31 March 2002.
At the beginning of the 2003 financial year, a small injection was made into the fund and contributions were recommenced.
During 2003, the scheme actuaries estimated that the fund had fallen further into deficit due to adverse market movements in fiscal 2003 and the Company made an additional contribution bringing the total to 32 million during the year.
The Group has, therefore, not recognised any amortisation of the surplus identified at 31 March 2001 in the year ended 31 March 2003.
An actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2003 is currently underway, but has still to be completed.
ii Healthcare Valuations of the retirement healthcare schemes operated by the Groups US subsidiaries are conducted annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the most recent valuation as at 1 April 2002 were that medical costs would increase by 9.0% in 2003 reducing ultimately to 5.0% and a discount rate of 7.25% was used.

These are excluded from the figures given above and are in respect of Customs and Excise and Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce bonds, ECGD recourse agreements, letters of credit and tender and performance bonds.
The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
All such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis of current information and legal advice and after taking into account the Groups insurance arrangements.
Outstanding claims include the class actions against, inter alia, AE Staley in the Illinois and Oregon Federal District Courts which arose after the grand jury investigation concerning high fructose corn syrup pricing.
Those actions were filed in 1995 and are proceeding to trial despite the disbanding of that grand jury in 1999 with no indictments being brought.
While there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at the balance sheet date will have a material adverse effect on the Groups future results or financial position.

Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms-length transaction between informed and willing parties, excluding accrued interest, and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
All debt and financial instruments used to manage the interest rate and currency of borrowings with a maturity of less than three months after the balance sheet date are assumed to have a fair value equal to the book value.
The book values are the amounts recorded in the balance sheet and include premium payments or receipts which are recognised over the period to which the relevant instrument relates.
