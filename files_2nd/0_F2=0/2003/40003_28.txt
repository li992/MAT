The preference shares are dilutive for the purpose of the diluted net assets per share calculations and have been treated as such.
The Group has also presented an adjusted basic earnings per share figure to exclude the impact of exceptional items, profits and losses on the sale of investment properties net of taxation and minority interests and deferred tax in respect of investment properties.
The directors consider that this adjusted figure gives a more meaningful comparison for the periods shown in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax has been excluded from the adjusted calculation as the Group has no plans to sell a significant proportion of its investment properties, and in any case it is generally very unusual for UK capital allowances to be recaptured on the disposal of a property.
Profits and losses on the sale of investment properties are excluded from adjusted earnings as these are non-recurring items.
Net assets per share are calculated on the equity shareholders' funds of 2,043.5 million 2002 2,107.3 million.
Adjusted net assets per share have been calculated on the same number of shares but shareholders' funds exclude the deferred tax liability of 193.1 million 2002 183.5 million as it is the opinion of the directors that deferred tax on capital allowances in relation to investment properties is unlikely to crystallise materially in practice.

At 31 December 2002 the deferred tax asset related to the exceptional write down of the Utilities plant in 2001 3.3 million and deferred costs in Canada 0.8 million.
The Group has a commitment to support the ongoing activities at the residential leisure development at Quail West until the overall activity reaches a certain level, which is not expected to occur for a number of years.
In accordance with UK GAAP the Group has therefore recognised a provision of 20.8 million for the estimated net liability arising from this commitment.
The most significant assumption in the determination of the provision is the rate of membership sales and the consequent timing of the release of the Group's commitment.
The Group board is satisfied that the assumptions used to compute the provision are appropriate and will review these at each subsequent balance sheet date.
The provision is stated at present value.
It will be amortised to the profit and loss account after allowing for the unwind of the discount used, on the basis of the actual losses incurred by the ongoing activities.
The other liabilities relate principally to provisions for onerous leases on rented properties and represent the estimated liability of future costs for lease rentals and dilapidation costs less the expected receipts from sub-letting these properties which are surplus to business requirements.
The estimated amount of potential taxation, for which no provision has been made and which would arise if the assets held as long-term investments were sold at the values at which they appear in the balance sheet, amounts to 129.5 million 2002 176.5 million.

20 Pensions The Group has continued to account for pensions under SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a below are those required by that standard.
FRS17 Retirement Benefits was issued in November 2000 and requires certain transitional disclosures to be made in addition to the requirements of SSAP24.
These disclosures, to the extent that they are not given in a, are set out in b below: a The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
Total pension costs for the Group were 3.9 million 2002 4.6 million of which 0.1 million 2002 1.1 million related to overseas schemes.
Pension costs relating to overseas schemes have been determined in accordance with local practice.
The company has two defined benefits schemes in the UK, the Slough Estates 1957 Pension Scheme the Slough scheme and the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme.
Their assets are held by trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
Contributions to the schemes, which are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method of calculation, are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
As at 31 December 2003 the Group had a pension prepayment of 0.7 million 2002 0.8 million representing the unamortised cost of a 1.4 million cash contribution made in 1998 to eliminate the calculated SSAP24 deficit in the 'Slough scheme'.
This cost is being amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis and will be fully amortised by the year ended 31 December 2008.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Slough scheme as at 31 March 2001 was carried out by William M Mercer.
The schemess assets were valued at market value.
The assumptions used to calculate the liabilities of the scheme included investment returns 2.0 per cent per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase and 2.25 per cent higher than the rate of increase in pensions.
In order to calculate the contribution rate required, longer term assumptions of investment returns 2.25 per cent per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase were used.
At the date of the latest valuation, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 42.4 million and the actuarial value of those assets represented 94 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
As a consequence, the company contribution rate was increased in 2001 by 6.08 per cent per annum to 24.97 per cent per annum.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Bilton scheme as at 5 April 2001 was carried out by Bacon & Woodrow.
The assets of the scheme were valued at market value.
The main assumptions used were investment returns 2.4 per cent per annum higher than the increase to pensions in payment and 2.4 per cent more than increases to pensions in deferment.
At the valuation date the market value of the assets of the scheme was 23.8 million and the actuarial value of those assets represented 117 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The actuary has recommended that no contributions are required from Bilton p. l. c. The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes in the UK and overseas.
The total cost for these schemes for the period, and fully expensed in the profit and loss account, amounted to 0.3 million 2002 1.3 million.
Supplementary ex-gratia pensions of 0.2 million 2002 0.1 million were paid out of profits.
86 Slough Estates Annual Report 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Pensions continued b FRS17 Retirement Benefits disclosures The valuation of the Slough and Bilton schemes used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2001 for Slough and 5 April 2001 for Bilton and updated by Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2003.
The assets of both schemes are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.
The projected unit method of valuation was used for both schemes and the financial assumptions used to calculate the schemes liabilities under FRS 17 are as follows: Slough scheme Bilton scheme % %% % %% At 31 December 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Discount rate 5.4 5.5 5.8 5.4 5.5 5.8 Inflation rate 2.8 2.3 2.5 2.8 2.3 2.6 Increase to deferred benefits during deferment 2.8 2.3 2.5 2.8 2.3 2.6 Rate of increase to pensions in payment pre 2003 pensions 4.2 4.2 4.0 2.7 2.4 2.5 Rate of increase to pensions in payment post 2003 pensions 2.7 2.4 n a n a n a n a Rate of increase in salaries 4.8 4.3 4.5 n a n a n a The assets in the Slough and Bilton schemes and the expected rates of return were: Long-term rate of return expected Valuation 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 % %% m m m Equities 7.80 7.52 8.67 39.2 33.8 44.5 Bonds 4.80 4.52 5.19 22.3 17.0 12.9 Other 6.48 6.416.15 2.7 4.0 6.0 Total market value of assets 64.2 54.8 63.4 Present value of schemes liabilities 91.8 81.7 70.9 Deficit in the schemes 27.6 26.9 7.5 Less Bilton surplus which cannot be utilised 1.2 0.8 28.8 27.7 7.5 Related deferred tax asset 8.6 8.3 2.3 Net pension liability 20.2 19.4 5.2 If the above net pension liability had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2003 would have been reduced by 20.2 million 2002 19.4 million.

All loans and overdrafts so guaranteed are included in the consolidated balance sheet.
The company has given performance guarantees to third parties amounting to 4.1 million 2002 3.6 million in respect of development contracts of subsidiary companies.
At 31 December 2003 Fibre Power Slough Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, was in commercial discussions with Amec Birwelco Limited regarding the contract to build a renewable energy power station.
Amec Birwelco have lodged an 8.1 million claim for time delay and additional work they allege to have done in respect of the project.
The directors of Fibre Power Slough Limited, having taken both legal and technical specialists advice, do not accept this claim on the basis that the work referred to in the claim was covered by the original contract.
It has also been rejected by the Independent Consulting Engineer who supervised the project.
Furthermore Fibre Power Slough Limited have lodged a counter claim for 5.3 million in respect of liquidated damages and extra work incurred because of the late delivery of the contract and poor initial fitness for purpose of the installation.
