42 Grainger Trust plc Notes to the financial statements 7 Taxation continued Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the period is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2003 2002 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 48.5 41.1 Profit on ordinary activities before tax at a rate of 30% 14.6 12.3 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.7 0.5 Effect of negative goodwill written back 1.5 4.5 Tax on fair values released on sales 4.4 13.9 Effect of timing differences 0.6 1.5 Difference between tax and accounting profit on disposals 0.2 1.7 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2.1 Total current tax 20.7 19.0 Factors that may affect future tax charges No provisions for deferred tax have been made on gains which would become payable if the groups investment properties were sold at their year end values.
The estimate of unprovided deferred tax is 16.5m 2002: 1.5m.
FRS19 prohibits the making of provisions for contingent tax liabilities on the fair value of properties on the acquisition of companies.
It had previously been industry practice to make partial provision for such liabilities as part of our fair value exercise on acquisition.
Thus there is a greater tax charge on property sales where there is no brought forward contingent tax provision available to be utilised in its reduction.
The total contingent tax to the group on the difference between original cost and carrying value of trading properties not provided at 30 September 2003 is 91.8m 2002: 42.0m.

Details of the acquisition of Bromley Property Holdings Limited are shown separately in note 27.
The contingent deferred consideration of 10.0m has been recognised because the directors believe the relevant criteria will be met.
The 10.0m is calculated by reference to the percentage increase in the non-seasonally adjusted Nationwide House Price Index which the figure published in respect of August 2004 represents over the figure representing August 2002.
If the increase amounts to 10%, the sum of 5.0m will be payable, rising by 0.1m for every 0.1% additional increase to a maximum of 10.0m when the increase amounts to 15% or more.
This consideration is payable on or before 17 December 2004.

The post acquisition cash flows and results of Bromley are not considered material by the directors and therefore have not been disclosed separately in the profit and loss account or cash flow statement.
The trading and profitability of Bromley, which is a substantial acquisition as defined in FRS6, for the period to acquisition are summarised as follows: 1 October 2002 to 26 September 2003 m Turnover 114.1 Operating profit 48.3 Profit before taxation 24.4 Taxation 16.1 Profit for the period 8.3 The profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2002 was 8.0m.
56 Grainger Trust plc Notes to the financial statements 27 Bromley Property Holdings Limited continued The statement of total recognised gains and losses for Bromley for the period to acquisition is as follows: 1 October 2002 to 26 September 2003 m Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 8.3 Unrealised surplus on revaluation of properties 8.8 Tax on realisation of revaluation surpluses 1.8 Total recognised gains and losses 15.3 28 Pension schemes Grainger Trust plc operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Pension arrangements for executive directors are disclosed in the remuneration committee report.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the group see note 6.
BPT Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bromley, currently contributes to two pension schemes.
The group will continue to contribute so as to spread the cost over the expected remaining lives of the relevant employees.
Defined benefit scheme The assets of the defined benefit scheme are held separately from those of the group in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment manager.
Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation using the projected unit method was undertaken as at 1 July 2001.
Based on actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 7.5% per annum and salary increases of 6% per annum, the assets were valued at 9.0m.
These were held in a relevant insurance contract.
These assets represented 85% of the value of the schemes accrued liabilities.
The deficiency is being met over the expected working lifetimes of the members.
The pension cost in the Joint Venture for the year ended 30 September 2003 was 0.4m 2002: 0.6m.
The actuary also undertook a Minimum Funding Requirement valuation as at 1 July 2001 in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995.
The value of the assets of the scheme was determined at 95% of the liabilities of the scheme.
FRS17 transitional disclosures The FRS17 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based on a valuation at 1 August 2003 adjusted to 30 September 2003 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: Discount rate 5.30% pa Rate of increase in salaries 3.70% pa Rate of increase in pensions in payment 5.00% pa Inflation assumption 2.70% pa The assets are invested in a with-profits deposit administration insurance policy with AXA Sun Life.
The fund value of the assets of the scheme was 10.5m as at 30 September 2003.
The expected rate of return on the assets was 6.3% as at 30 September 2003.
The following approximate amounts were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS17: 30 September 2003 m Total market value of assets 10.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 14.2 Deficit in the scheme 3.7 Related deferred tax assets 1.1 Net pension liability 2.6 57 Grainger Trust plc Notes to the financial statements 28 Pension schemes continued If these amounts had been recognised as part of the net assets of Bromley, the adjustment to the pension liability of 2.6m would have been reflected in the net assets acquired as at 26 September 2003.
The adjustment to pensions balances to reflect the adoption of FRS17 would be to goodwill, with nil net impact on net assets and the profit and loss reserve.
Consequently, the disclosure requirements of FRS17 with respect to the impact of the above net pension liability measured in accordance with FRS17 have not been presented.
The following amounts would have been recognised in the performance statements of the Joint Venture in the year to 30 September 2003 under the requirements of FRS17: m Operating profit Current service cost 0.3 Past service cost Total operating charge 0.3 Other finance income Interest on pension scheme liabilities 0.7 Expected return on pension scheme assets 0.6 Net return 0.1 Statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 0.3 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 0.1 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 1.1 Actuarial loss recognised 1.3 Movements in deficit for the year ended 30 September 2003 m Deficit in scheme at 1 October 2002 3.1 Movement in year: Current service cost 0.3 Past service cost Contributions 1.1 Other finance income 0.1 Actuarial loss 1.3 Deficit in scheme at year end 3.7 58 Grainger Trust plc Notes to the financial statements 28 Pension schemes continued Details of experience gains and losses for the year ended 30 September 2003.
