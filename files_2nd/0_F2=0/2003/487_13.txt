Deferred tax is measured on a Borrowings non-discounted basis.
All financial instruments with a cost to the Group, with the exception of share capital, have been included in borrowings.
Consequently finance leases and bills of exchange, which have a cost to the Group, are included in net borrowings.
The cost of bills of exchange and finance leases has been included in net interest.
Borrowings are shown net of the associated finance costs, which are amortised to the profit and loss account over the life of the borrowings.
Foreign currencies The profit and loss account items of overseas subsidiaries and related companies are translated into sterling using average exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies including goodwill arising on acquisitions are translated at the mid-market rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date unless matched by forward contracts.
Where the translation of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings, net of any foreign currency borrowing used to finance them, gives rise to an exchange difference, this is taken directly to reserves.
Other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments The principal derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the Groups risk management policy and no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Interest differentials are taken to net interest receivable in the profit and loss account, and premiums and fees are amortised at a constant rate over the life of the underlying instrument.
Government grants Grants relating to fixed assets are treated as deferred income and are transferred to revenue in equal amounts over the life of the assets.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
In the holding company and its subsidiaries the liability is assessed with reference to the individual company.
On consolidation the liability is assessed with reference to the Group as a whole.

5 Pension costs The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
The disclosures given below are those required by that standard.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits was issued in November 2000 but will not be fully mandatory for the Group and the Company until the year ended 31st December 2005.
Prior to this, phased transitional disclosures are required.
The required disclosures are shown below.
The Group operates a pension scheme which covers the majority of United Kingdom employees.
Membership on a final salary basis was closed in 2001 but the scheme remains open to new entrants on a defined contribution basis.
The assets are held in trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
Other defined benefit schemes operated within the Group are the Mono Equipment Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, the Amari plc Pension and Life Assurance Plan and, various Bongard arrangements.
Various defined contribution schemes exist across the Group and the total contributions in the year were 0.6m 2002: 0.6m.
36 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 Notes to the accounts 5 Pension costs continued The latest full valuation of the main United Kingdom scheme was carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP, independent consulting actuaries, as at 31st December 2002 using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions on which the valuation was based for the purposes of establishing the Groups pension cost were that the investment return would be 2.5% greater than general salary increases, and between 3.25% and 4% greater than increases in future pension payments.
The results of the valuation showed that the scheme had an aggregate market value of 575.8m and was 104% funded.
The surplus has been spread forward on the fixed monetary amount basis.
This valuation has been used for preparing the 2003 accounts.
The pension prepayment held in the Groups balance sheet at 31st December 2003 was 23.3m 2002: 20.9m.
The normal pension cost of 3.2m for 2003 was charged against provisions established in 2001 to address pension costs arising from the sale of the pipes businesses to Etex.
Group defined benefit scheme contributions of 5.5m 2002: 7.4m based on pensionable salaries were made during the year ended 31st December 2003.
Contributions of 0.3m 2002: 0.2m were owed to the schemes at the 31st December 2003.
It has been agreed with the trustees of the main UK scheme that contributions for the next year will be 12.8% 2002 restated: 12.8% for all members accruing benefits on a final salary basis with the exception of members of the former 1970 scheme and 32.8% 2002 restated: 32.8% for members of the former 1970 scheme.
These rates are subject to review at the next triennial actuarial valuation.
As the Group scheme is closed to new entrants, under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, expressed as a percentage of pensionable salaries, will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on an updated actuarial valuation at 31st December 2003 by a qualified actuary.
This takes account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31st December 2003.
2002 disclosures have been restated to include Bongard schemes.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31st December 2003.

18 Financial instruments The Groups objective in using financial instruments is to minimise its exposure to financial risk.
The group treasurer coordinates banking, investment of surplus funds and arrangement of ongoing borrowing requirements and the use of financial instrument transactions where appropriate.
The Group manages the financial instrument credit risk and investment risk by entering into transactions with established financial institutions and relationship banks.
Major corporate-related transactions are carried out by the group treasury team which operates as a cost centre.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
Policies for managing these risks are governed by board approved policies and procedures, which have remained unchanged since the beginning of 2003.
Foreign currency transactional risk The Group requires its operating units to use forward currency contracts for any material committed sales or purchases denominated in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Operating units undertake transactional hedging within the parameters set by the board and the level of transactional hedging and exposure is reviewed by group treasury on a monthly basis.
Foreign currency structural risk With its strategy of growth and expansion on an international scale, the Group has significant investment in overseas operations.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of such structural currency exposures by borrowing in the same currency as the functional currency of its operating units.
In managing the structural currency exposures, the Groups objectives are to minimise borrowing costs and to retain some potential for currency-related appreciation whilst hedging against currency depreciation.
At the end of 2003, the Euro liabilities represented 35.1% of Euro net assets.
Interest rate risk The Group maintains its policy to minimise interest rate risk on its borrowings and deposits by using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements where appropriate.
The Groups policy is, normally, to have between 25% and 75% of debt at fixed rates at any time, depending on debt levels and market conditions.
Interest rate risk is currently minimised, without the need to use derivative financial instruments, as explained in the paragraph below.
44 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 Notes to the accounts 18 Financial instruments continued The Group started its financial year with surplus funds, providing it with the opportunity to develop its core businesses.
As the Groups objective was to maintain flexibility in utilising these funds, the maturity profile has been kept short throughout 2003, and the acquisitions made during the year were financed by the surplus funds.
At the year end, all of the Groups investments were floating rate, with a weighted average maturity of one month.
The ongoing financial liabilities are all interest bearing and floating rate.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all of the following disclosures, other than the currency exposure.
a Currency and interest rate exposure of financial assets and liabilities The following table analyses the currency and interest rate composition of the Groups financial liabilities, comprising total borrowings of 22.4m 2002: 23.3m included in note 17, the provision for vacant leasehold properties of 0.7m 2002: 1.0m included in note 19 and deferred consideration payable in respect of the Domain acquisition.

The provision for vacant leasehold properties is considered to be a non-interest bearing liability and has an average period to maturity of 3 years 2002: 4 years.

As the majority of the borrowings mature within two years, there were no interest rate swaps in place at the year end.
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts has been calculated using the spot rate of exchange at the year end.
e Currency exposures The table below shows the currency exposure of the Groups net monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency after taking account of forward foreign exchange contracts held to manage such exposures.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account.
