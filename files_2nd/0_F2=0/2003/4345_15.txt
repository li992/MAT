The Dairy Crest Fund, which is of the defined benefits type, is funded by contributions from employees and the Group.
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
An actuarial assessment of the Dairy Crest Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2001 by the Funds actuary using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the assessment were that, over the long term, the annual rate of return on the investments would be 2.5% higher than the increase in pensionable pay, 4.1% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment and 4.75% higher than the normal level of annual net dividend yield receivable.
At the date of the assessment, the market value of the Dairy Crest Fund assets amounted to 515.9 million.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 123% of the value of the members accrued benefits representing an actuarial surplus of 86.8 million.
The surplus is amortised over the service lives of Fund members on average 11.5 years as an even percentage of payroll resulting in a credit to the profit and loss account of 8.6 million.
The next actuarial valuation will be carried out at 31 March 2004.
The net pension debtor at 31 March 2003 was 4.3 million 2002 4.2 million.
The Group has charged 0.8 million in respect of unfunded pensions for directors whose benefits are restricted by Inland Revenue limits.
Group contributions paid to the Dairy Crest Fund amounted to 3.8 million.
FRS 17 was issued in November 2000.
However, it is not mandatory until the financial year ending 31 March 2006, pending the introduction of International Accounting Standards which are expected to be introduced for the year to 31 March 2006.
Under this standard certain disclosures are required as to the potential impact on the balance sheet, profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses as if FRS 17 was adopted.
The calculation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2001 and updated by Aon Consulting to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2002 and 31 March 2003.
This update does not represent a formal valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
