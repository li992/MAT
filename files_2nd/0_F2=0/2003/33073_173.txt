For the calculation of combined ordinary capital, the exchange rate of 1 Fl.
12 5.445 has been used, in accordance with the Equalisation Agreement.
Earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets is provided in this Annual Report & Accounts because the Directors believe it better explains the ongoing trends in the Groups performance during the duration of the Path to Growth programme.
This measure is an important component of the targets on which Directors annual performance bonuses are based.
United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 14 requires the company to provide a reconciliation of earnings in the notes to the accounts in these circumstances.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share are based on a conversion into PLC ordinary shares of the shares in a group company which are convertible in the year 2038 as described in Control of Unilever on page 152, and b the exercise of share options, details of which are set out in note 29 on page 116.
