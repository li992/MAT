The deficit on an ongoing basis is being reduced over members future working lives by additional company contributions.

Foreign currency holdings and borrowings An analysis by currency of Group net cash at the year end is as follows:- Net cash Net cash balance at balance at Currency 30th June 30th June 2003 2002 000 000 Pounds Sterling 69,158 81,799 US Dollar 10,974 26,446 Japanese Yen 3,427 3,788 Euro 15,632 13,719 Other 1,890 2,190 37,235 35,656 The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid.
Net assets and associated borrowings at the year end were:- As noted in the Operating and financial review on page 14, the Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were as follows: Currency Net assets of Currency Base borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate 000 000 % US Dollar 17,492 15,673 1.1% Japanese Yen 9,903 9,554 0.1% Euro 17,252 18,302 2.2% The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, short-term currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
Foreign currency holdings and borrowings - continued Unrecognised gains and losses on currency hedges at the year end:- 000 Unrecognised gains on hedges at 1st July 2002 1,859 Gains arising in previous years that were recognised in 2003 1,859 Gains arising in 2003 that were not recognised in the year 31 Unrecognised gains on hedges at 30th June 2003 31 All unrecognised gains on hedges at 30th June 2003 are expected to be recognised within 12 months.
Gains and losses on instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures.
At the year end, there were no unrecognised gains or losses on foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.
Short-term debtors and creditors, as defined in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments disclosures, have been omitted from all the financial instruments disclosures, save for those relating to currency risk.
