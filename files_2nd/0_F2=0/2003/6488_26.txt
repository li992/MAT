Accounts and notes Geest PLC 99 Notes to the accounts for the fty three weeks ended 3 January 2004 1 Prior period adjustment UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts has been adopted for the first time in the fifty three weeks ended 3 January 2004.
UITF Abstract 38 changes the presentation of own shares held in ESOP trusts from requiring them to be recognised as an asset to requiring them to be deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
There is no impact on the profit for either the current or preceding periods as a result of this adjustment.
The effect for both the Group and the Company of implementing UITF Abstract 38 has been to reduce fixed asset investments by 3.6 million 2002: 4.8 million, accruals and deferred income by 1.3 million 2002: 2.2 million and equity shareholders funds by 2.3 million 2002: 2.6 million.
The information regarding the prior fifty two week period has been restated accordingly.

The differences are explained below: 53 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 3 January 28 December million 2004 2002 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 31.5 40.9 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation at the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 30% 2002: 30% 9.5 12.3 Factors affecting charge for period: Capital allowances for period in excess of depreciation plus other timing differences 1.3 2.8 Timing differences in respect of pension funding 1.0 1.4 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior period 6.6 3.6 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.2 0.3 Foreign tax charged at different rates than UK standard rates 0.3 0.3 Total current tax charge 1.5 4.5 Factors that may affect future tax charges For the foreseeable future, it is expected that the current tax charge will be lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
This is due to the use of tax efficient structuring of major transactions and capital allowances exceeding depreciation.

These schemes have been set up by formal trusts and are administered by Trustees or Trustee Companies.
The assets of each scheme are held in separate trustee administered funds or fully insured with an insurance company.
In the UK, the two main schemes, one a defined contribution scheme and the other a funded defined benefit scheme, are open to employees joining Geest on a permanent contract full time or part time.
Approximately 25% of eligible UK employees belong to a Group pension scheme.
Contributions are assessed on the basis of the advice of qualified actuaries using either the attained age method or the projected unit credit method.
Pension costs charged credited in arriving at profit on ordinary activities before taxation and exceptional costs were: 53 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 3 January 28 December million 2004 2002 UK defined benefit scheme: Regular pension costs 3.0 2.6 Spreading of surplus 5.0 4.8 UK defined benefit scheme net credit 2.0 2.2 UK defined contribution scheme net charge 0.5 0.6 Overseas net charge 0.2 0.2 Total credit 1.3 1.4 No amounts were owing at the period end 2002: nil for the defined contribution scheme.
The surplus disclosed by the valuation is being recognised over the average remaining service lives of the members.
The latest full valuation of the main UK defined benefit scheme was completed as at 31 March 2001.
The results and assumptions, which have the most significant effect on the funding position of the defined benefit scheme, are: Method used Projected unit credit Investment returns to exceed salary growth by % 2.5 Investment returns to exceed pensions growth by % 3.0 Market value of scheme assets million 114.8 Level of funding % 146.0 Actuarially calculated surplus million 36.3 The actuarial value of assets as a percentage of the benefits accrued to members is after allowing for future salary and pension increases.
An amount of 16.8 million 2002: 13.1 million is included in debtors falling due after more than one year representing the excess of amounts contributed over the accumulated pension cost.
No improvements were made to benefits in the period and the Group paid contributions in the period of 1.7 million 2002: 1.6 million, representing 6.25% of aggregate pensionable salaries.
The actuarial value of the liability includes allowance for discretionary increases to pensions earned prior to April 1997.
Whilst the Company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs, under FRS 17 Retirement benefits the following transitional disclosures are required: Additional FRS 17 disclosures The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based upon the latest full actuarial valuation at 31 March 2001, and updated by the actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the assets and liabilities of the scheme at 3 January 2004 and 28 December 2002.

28 Post balance sheet events On 5 December 2003 it was announced that discussions were in progress to form a new business NewCo, which would combine initially the current import activity of Geests English Village Salads Limited EVS a business dedicated to Asda Wal-Mart Asda and the business of Thames Fruit Ltd an exclusive importer of citrus fruits and melons for Asda.
The Group will hold 76% of NewCo.
