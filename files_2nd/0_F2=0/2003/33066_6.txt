Group management reviews and monitors business unit performance by use of key performance indicators which differ in certain respects from the way results are reported in the Group Accounts which are determined byUK andUS GAAP.
Business units report sales of Ongoing Operations only and at constant rates of exchange throughout a particular year.
The effects of currency movements are excluded by setting at the beginning of each year exchange rates whichremain constant throughoutthe year.
These are termed the Management Rates MR for the year.
These are reset each year and prior year comparative data re-translated to the new rates.
Additional sales brought in by acquisitions, for which there are no prior year comparatives, are excluded from the calculation of underlying sales growth which is managements key indicator of sales performance.
In the tables below, underlying sales growth can be calculated by dividing current year turnover at MR by  MR. Business units report operating profit of Ongoing Operations before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items andat constantrates ofexchangeduringthe year.
Management believes its internal reporting measures are the most appropriate since they focus on underlying business performance and exclude the distorting effects of exchange rate translation and nonoperatingitems.
Thesemeasures are used inall financialreporting, budgets, planningand incentiveplans.
Results in the Group Accounts are reported at the average rates for each year AR see Note 1 and Note29.

Foreign Exchange The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge trading creditors and an element of anticipated purchases over the following 12 months.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are sterling and US Dollars.
At 31 December 2003, the Group had contracted to  equivalent of 199m.
The Groups operating units hold no material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional operating currency.
Therefore, there are no currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities that  gainsorlosses inthe profit and loss account.

93 25 Share Option Plans The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002 adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002 is available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months service.
The scheme provides for employees to save up to 250 per month and are given an option to acquire a set number of shares based on the committed amount to be saved.
Theoptionpriceis the higherof the nominal value and not less than 80% of the middle market quotation of the Ordinary Shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation.
The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002 is offered to employees in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Employees in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and France are able to participate respectively in the Smith & Nephew Belgian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew Italian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew Dutch Sharesave Plan 2002 and the Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2002.
Participants in Ireland are able to participate in the Smith & Nephew Irish Employee Share Option Scheme.
These plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002.
Options are no longer issued under the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 14 May 1981 and the Smith & Nephew 1991 Overseas Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 25 May 1990 but options remain to be exercised under these two schemes.
Togetherall ofthe plans referred to above are termed the Employee Schemes.
The Smith & Nephew 1985 Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 9 May 1985, the Smith & Nephew 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on15 May 1990, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan and the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001, together termed the Executive Schemes, are operated at the discretionof the Boardof Directors.
Under the terms of the Executive Schemes, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may select full-time employees of the Group for the grant of options to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan are to acquire ADSs.
The option price will not be less than the market value of an Ordinary Share, or the nominal value if higher.
The market value will be the quoted price on the business day preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant.
For Executive Schemes adopted in 2001, the market value will be the average quoted price of an Ordinary Share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or, for the US Plan, the average quoted price of an ADS for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan, the exercise of options granted from 1997 are subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan are not subject to performance conditions but become exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
The 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan are open to senior managers outside the UK and the 1990 International Executive Share OptionSchemeandthe US Planare opentoseniormanagers inthe US, Canada, Mexicoand PuertoRico.
Under the Executive Schemes, the number of Ordinary Shares over which options may be granted is limited so that the number of shares issued or that may be issued under the Executive Schemes during the ten years preceding the date of grant shall not exceed 5% of the Ordinary Share capital at the date of grant.
The total number of Ordinary Shares which may be issuable in any ten-year period under all employee share schemes operated bythe Companymaynotexceed 10% of the OrdinaryShare capital at the date of grant.
Employees in the US are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount of 15% or more if the shares appreciate in value duringthe plans  to the market price, througha regularsavings plan.
Share Option Plans continued The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair values of options granted for Employee Schemes: dividend yield of 1.1% 2002 1.3%, 2001 1.1%, expected volatility of 23.3% 2002 19.6%, 2001 19.4%, risk free interest rate of 4.6% 2002 4.5%, 2001 5.0% and expected life of 3.6years 20023.6years, 20015.0years.

Post-Retirement Benefits The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countriesin whichit has major operating companies.
Pension plans are established under the laws of the relevant country, funded by the payment of contributions to, and the assets held by, separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In those countries where there is no company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered adequate.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject ofregularmanagement review.
For many years, the Groups major pension plans in the United Kingdom UK Plan and the United States US Plan were of the defined benefit type.
However, from 2003 all new employees were provided with a defined contribution pension plan.
Existing employees were given the opportunity to choose whether to  planorchangetothe newarrangements.
The pension cost for the UK Plan and the US Plan has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the defined benefit plans approach retirement.
At the dates of the most recent actuarial valuations for the purposes of SSAP 24 in September and December 2002, the aggregate market value of the assets of the UK Plan and the US Plan was 230m 2002 268m: valuations in September and December 2001 representing 78% of plan liabilities for accrued benefits, including allowance for projected future increases in salaries, resulting in a net deficit of 64.5m 2002 93% and a net deficit of 19.8m.
The estimated deficit of these plans at 31 December 2003was 55m 2002 80m.
 of the UK Planand US Plan deficits was 70.1m 2002 deficit 20.8m.
The contributions made to the UK Plan and the US Plan in the accounting period were 8.5m 2002 2.6m and 10.4m 20025.2m, respectively.
The agreed contribution rates for 2004 and 2005 are 11% of pensionable earnings plus a supplementary payment of 4.3m in each year to the UK Plan and 7%  a supplementary payment of 10min2004 to the US Plan.

New Accounting Standards New Accounting Standards in the UK FRS 17 FRS 17 Retirement Benefits was issued in November 2000.
Full implementation has been deferred until 1 January 2005.
Some disclosure requirements are effective for periods prior to this date.
The standard requires that financial statements reflect at fair value the assets and liabilities arising from an employers retirement benefit obligations and related funding.
Current and past service costs are charged to operating expense in the period in which they are earned, the interest cost on accrued liabilities less expected return on assets is charged as net finance costs and changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities are taken to reserves in the period.
Had FRS 17 been implemented at 31 December 2003, the Group would have reported a retirement liability, net of related deferred tax, of 86.5m 2002 80.2m, which compares with 1.7m 2002 4.8m recorded in the balance sheet under the existing rules.
The impact of FRS 17 on retained earnings for 2003 would have been to reduce retained earnings by 84.8m 2002 75.4m Note34.
New Accounting Standards in the US FIN 46 FIN 46 Consolidationof Variable Interest Entities was issued  revised in December 2003.
It requires additional disclosures to be made in financial statements issued after January 2003 and becomes fully effective for accounting periods ending after 15 March 2004.
FIN 46 requires entities to be consolidated if their financial affairs are being supported by a third party even if that third party is not an equity holder.
Management does not believe that this standard will result in any additional entities .
DifferencesBetween Accounting PrinciplesGenerally Accepted in the UK and US The Group accounts are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Those differences which have a significant effect on the Groups profit for the financial year and shareholders funds are as follows: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Prior to 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions was set off against reserves.
On disposal of such businesses, goodwill previously set off against reserves is charged to profit or loss on disposal.
Since 1998, goodwilland other intangible fixed assets purchased by way of acquisition have been capitalised and written off over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under US GAAP, goodwill and other intangible fixed assets purchased prior to 2002 would have been capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives.
Commencing 2002, goodwill would not be amortised and would be subject to an annual impairment review, whereas other intangibleassets wouldcontinuetobe capitalised and amortised overtheiruseful lives.
Fair value adjustments to goodwill may be made in the first full financial period after acquisition.
Under US GAAP, these may only be made withinone year of acquisition.
Thus, any adjustments post this period would be takentothe profitandloss accountforthe year.
Goodwill arising on the formation of the joint venture is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment review.
Under US GAAP, prior to 2002 this goodwill would be amortised.
Commencing 2002, this goodwill wouldnotbe amortised.
Joint Venture and Associated Undertaking One of the components of the goodwill in the joint venture is the difference between the fair value of consideration given and the book value of net assets acquired in the joint venture by the Group.
Under US GAAP, thisgainwouldbe unrealisedand wouldnotbe recognised.
The results of the joint venture are included within turnover, operating profit, interest and taxation.
The results of the associated undertaking are included within operating profit, interest and taxation.
Under US GAAP, the Groups share of the after tax profits of the joint venture and associated undertaking would be reflected in the income statement as a single line item and its net investment in the joint venture would be included as a single line item in the balance sheet with the investment in the Groups associated undertaking.
Post-Retirement Benefits Projected benefit liabilities are discounted using long-term investment returns and surpluses and deficits are amortised over the employees service lives.
Under US GAAP, pension liabilities would be discounted using corporate bond rates and surpluses and deficits within 10% limits would not be amortised and would thus have no immediate impact on pension costs.
In addition, under US GAAP where the value of plan assets is below the value of the liabilities valued on an accumulated benefit obligation basis, the deficit would be .
Trade Investments Trade investments are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value and any movements in provisions are taken to the profit and loss account for the year.
Under US GAAP, trade investments would be stated at market value and movements in market value would be takentoshareholders  year.
Factoring of Debts Trade debtors are stated in the balance sheet net of non-returnable proceeds received.
Under US GAAP, trade debtors wouldbe stated gross andproceeds received wouldbe includedinborrowings.
 and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments in respect of anticipated future transactions, interest rate risks and intragroup equity investments are accounted for as hedges.
Under US GAAP, all derivative instruments including 109 40.
DifferencesBetween Accounting PrinciplesGenerally Accepted in the UK and US continued those embedded in other contracts are recognised as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
US GAAP prescribes requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships and ongoing assessments of effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as part of a hedge transaction would be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedge transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting would be  financialyear.
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts in respect of anticipated future transactions are treated as hedges and not marked to market.
Under US GAAP, such contracts would be valued at the forward rates at the balance sheet date with the gains and losses included in profit for the financial year.
On maturity of the contractthe gain  wouldbe recognisedinprofit forthe financialyear.
Interest Rate Swaps Interest rate swaps used to fix interest rates on the Groups major exposures are treated as hedges and not marked to market.
Under US GAAP, these swaps would not be treated as hedges, due to the additional documentation requirement, and gains and losses on valuing such contracts at the balance sheet date wouldbe  financialyear.
Currency Rate Swaps Currency swaps are used to hedge intra Group equity investments.
Realised and unrealised gains losses are not recognised in profit for the year but are recorded as movements in reserves.
Receivables and payables on currency swaps are included within debtors and creditors respectively.
Under US GAAP, these swaps would be separately classified into current asset derivatives, current liabilities derivatives and .
Dividends Dividends are provided in the period to which they relate and, in the case of proposed final dividends, on the basis of proposals bythe Directors.
Under US GAAP, dividends wouldbe provided forinthe accountsfor the periodinwhichtheyare declared.
Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised on most timing differences.
This is generally consistent with US GAAP, except that deferred taxation is provided on goodwill acquired prior to 1998, which has been set off against reserves and on which taxation benefits have been received.
Under US GAAP, as goodwill acquired prior to 1998 would not have been set off against reserves, the deferred taxation provided under UK GAAP would not be required.
Furthermore, under US GAAP, a deferred tax liability would be provided on intangible assets acquiredsubject  relief is available.
Acquired in-ProcessResearch and Development Acquired in-process research and development is not separately identified and therefore forms part of the goodwill arising on acquisition.
Under US GAAP, acquired in-process research and development would be identifiedseparately  the profit and loss accountonthe date of acquisition.
Leases The criteria for capitalising leases under UK GAAP differ from those under US GAAP.
As a result, certain leases which are classified as operating leases under UK GAAP would have been capitalised under US GAAP.
DifferencesBetween Accounting PrinciplesGenerally Accepted in the UK and US continued Discontinued Activities Under UK GAAP, the results of operations arising from discontinued operations are presented in the profit and loss account under the relevant captions and the profit loss on their disposal is reported as a separate line item after operating income and before interest.
Under US GAAP, the results of operations from discontinued operations and the profit loss on their disposal are reported as separate line items immediatelybefore net income.
Exceptional Items Items classified as exceptional under UK GAAP do not meet the definition of extraordinary under US GAAP andtherefore underUS GAAP these wouldbe classified as operatingexpenses.
Staff Costs Under UK GAAP, the Group does not account for stock based compensation.
Under US GAAP, stock based compensation would be recognised under the fair value  of FAS 123 Accounting for StockBased  the profit and loss accountforthe year.

Under UK GAAP, cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, dividends from joint ventures, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, investing activities and financing activities.
US GAAP requires only three categories of cash flow activity to be reported: operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance shown under UK GAAP would be included as operating activities under US GAAP.
The payment of dividends wouldbe includedas a  GAAP.
