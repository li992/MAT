notes relating to the accounts 1 Basis of presentation of financial information Implementation of UK Accounting Standards New accounting standards UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts This standard requires the assets and liabilities of the Groups ESOP trust to be recognised in the Groups financial statements where there is fide facto control of those assets and liabilities.
The companys own shares held by the ESOP trust should be deducted from shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Prior to the adoption of UITF 38, the companys own shares held by the ESOP trust were recognised as an asset on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
The new standard is effective for periods ending on or after 22 June 2004, but the Group has elected to apply this standard in these financial statements.
All primary statements and notes relating to the accounts have been restated accordingly.
Compliance with UITF 38 has reduced the 2002 investments and shareholders funds by 36m 2001 30m.
The net profit for 2002 was unaffected 2001 increase 22m.
The estimated impact on the current years profit if UITF 38 had not been adopted would be to reduce net profit by 19m.
The new standard has no impact on cash flows.
17 Retirement benefits as amended This Standard sets out revised requirements for the accounting and disclosure of an employers retirement benefit obligations and related funding.
The Group has followed the transitional requirements of the Standard and has provided increasing levels of disclosure of amounts measured in accordance with the requirements of the Standard in its accounts for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003.
With the exception of the recognition in the primary statements, which, with restated comparative data, is required for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005, the full extent of the requirements of FRS No.
17 are now disclosed in note 36 to these financial statements.
The requirements of the Standard will have no impact on cash flows.
Restatements arising in prior years FRS No.
19 Deferred Tax The results reported in these financial statements for 2001 were restated in 2002 to reflect the requirements of FRS No.
The deficit on Shareholders funds at 1 January 2001, originally reported in the accounts to 31 December 2001 at 216m, has been restated in these financial statements at a deficit of 249m.
The taxation charge originally reported for 2001 has been restated and increased by 41m to 97m.
The deficit on Shareholders funds at 31 December 2001 increased by 81m from 283m as originally reported, to 364m.

Comparative earnings per share and dividends per share figures for 2001 have been restated from the reported figures in 2001 after adjusting for FRS No.
19 see above by applying the factor 265 319 in order to adjust for the bonus issue within the Rights Issue.
Continuing and Discontinued Operations For UK reporting purposes, the results in these accounts differentiate between the Groups continuing and discontinued operations.

Cash In the statement of Group cash flow and related notes cash includes cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts: deposits are repayable on demand if they are, in practice, available within 24 hours without penalty.

No taxes have been provided for liabilities which may arise on the distribution of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates, except where distributions of such profits are planned.
Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates totalled approximately 1,309m at 31 December 2003 2002 996m: 2001 887m.
It is not practicable to calculate the tax which would arise on remittance of these amounts: it would be substantially lower than statutory rates after giving effect to foreign tax credits.

The change in valuation allowances during the year ended 31 December 2003 was 14m 2002 4m and the valuation allowance has been reduced by 2m 2002 nil by a change in circumstances.
Operating losses of 454m 2002 442m are carried forward and available to reduce future taxable income in a number of jurisdictions: these losses have given rise to deferred tax assets of 157m 2002 140m against which are set valuation adjustments of 83m 2002 73m.

Employees share option schemes and other share based plans ICI granted share options and other market based units to Executive Directors, senior executives and certain key employees under three main plans: the Performance Growth Plan, the Share Option Scheme Senior Staff Scheme, and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP.
These schemes are described on pages 42 to 44.
The Company also operates a savings related share option scheme UK Sharesave for all UK employees meeting minimum service requirements.
At 31 December 2003, the number of conditional awards of ordinary share equivalents outstanding under the Performance Growth Plan was 2,888,320 2002 2,471,791.
The prices at which options are granted under the Senior Staff Scheme must not be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share nor less than the average of the middle market quotation of an ICI Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the five business days immediately preceding the date on which the option is offered.
Options under this scheme expire after 10 years.
Grants under the SARP are made on the same terms as the Senior Staff Scheme.
On exercise the participant receives the gain payable in American Depositary Shares ADSs for grants prior to 1998 paid twothirds in cash and one-third in ADSs.
The Bonus Conversion Plan, which operated for the last time in respect of the 1999 performance year, closed during 2003.
Therefore, at 31 December 2003 there were no shares outstanding representing the matched shares under the Bonus Conversion Plan to be delivered as the Companys Ordinary Shares or in the form of ADSs.
The Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire under forward contracts, 35.2 million shares or ADSs to hedge its obligations under the Senior Staff Scheme, the Performance Growth Plan, and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan.
8.8 million shares have been purchased in the market by a trust see note 14.

At 31 December 2003, no collateral payments have been made.
These shares are intended to satisfy requirements for share options exercisable in the period 2004 to 2013.
A provision of 70m has been made to write-down the shares under forward commitments to estimated net realisable value having regard to the period over which the related options are exercisable.
Under the UK Sharesave Scheme the price at which options are granted must not be less than the greater of the nominal value of an Ordinary Share, or 80% of the average market value of an Ordinary Share on the three business days preceding the day on which the offer of options is made.
The total purchase cost in respect of options granted under the UK Sharesave Scheme is deducted from salary over a period of three or five years at the choice of the employee.
The maximum number of shares made available under this scheme for issue under option during a 10 year period is 5% of the Companys Ordinary Share Capital in issue on 21 March 1994.
Options granted to Directors are shown in the Remuneration report on page 43 and 44.
Movements in the number of shares under option during 2003 comprised new options 19.6m, options exercised 0.2m, and options lapsed or waived 10.7m.

Pensions SSAP 24 Group The Company and most of its subsidiaries operate retirement schemes which cover the majority of employees including Directors of the Group.
ICI policy, where practicable, is to provide retirement benefits for new employees on a defined contribution basis.
The Company pays pension contributions for each employee into an individual retirement account which is used to provide pension benefits at retirement.
This policy is now in place in the majority of countries in which ICI operates.
However, retirement plans for most existing employees are generally of the defined benefit type under which benefits are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration and are funded through separate trustee-administered funds.
Formal valuations of the Groups main defined benefit schemes are undertaken regularly, by independent qualified actuaries, normally at least triennially and adopting the projected unit method.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which they are situated.
For the Groups major plans the principal weighted average rates used were: 2003 2002 %p.
Discount rate used in determining the actuarial present values of the benefit obligations 5.7 6.0 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 5.8 6.1 Rate of increase of future earnings 3.7 4.0 Increase in pensions in payment 2.1 2.4 In arriving at the valuations of the Groups major defined benefit schemes, fund assets were valued at market values on the date of valuation of each fund.
The value of these assets was 7,083m 2002 7,721m and was sufficient to cover 91% 2002 99% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The total pension cost for the Group for 2003 was 120m 2002 89m: 2001 70m.
Accrued pension costs, which are included in other creditors note 19, amounted to 37m 2002 9m.
Provisions for the benefit obligations of a small number of unfunded plans amounted to 134m 2002 148m and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges pensions note 21.
Prepaid pension costs amounting to 507m 2002 525m are included in debtors note 16.
ICI Pension Fund The ICI Pension Fund accounts for approximately 85% of the Groups major plans in terms of asset values and projected benefit liabilities.
Based on the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2000, the Company agreed to make six annual payments into the Fund of 30m per annum from 2001 through 2006, subject to a review in 2003.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Fund, as at 31 March 2003, disclosed a solvency ratio of 93% and the Company has agreed to make a further nine annual payments into the Fund of 62m per annum from 2004 to 2012, subject to a review at the next valuation, and to provide an asset-backed guarantee, via a wholly owned subsidiary specifically incorporated to provide the guarantee, for 250m to support its commitments to the Fund see note 40.
The deficit, together with the prepayment, is taken into account in arriving at the employers pension costs charged in the accounts by being amortised as a percentage of pensionable emoluments over the expected working lifetime of existing members.
In 2003 this gave rise to a SSAP 24 charge of 42m 2002 16m.
Healthcare UITF Abstract 6 The Group provides in North America, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, certain unfunded healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
At 31 December 2003 approximately 18,000 2002 20,000 current and retired employees were eligible to benefit from these schemes.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are fully accrued over the expected working lifetime of the existing members.
The total post-retirement healthcare cost for the Groups major post-retirement benefit schemes for 2003 was 15m 2002 12m: 2001 10m and the provision at the year end was 167m 2002 179m.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 6, the Group has adopted the measurement basis of the US Standard, SFAS No.
106 as the basis of its UK GAAP reporting.
Costs and provisions were determined on an actuarial basis.
The assumptions relating to the schemes are set out in the table in note 41.
The healthcare cost trend has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
For the Group, increasing the assumed healthcare cost for the major schemes by 1% in every year would increase the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of 31 December 2003 by 11m 2002 11m and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the year ended 31 December 2003 by 1m 2002 2m.

The figures shown above take into account various interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to manage the interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities.
b Currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities As explained in the Operating and Financial Review, on page 22, the Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
As a result there are no significant non functional currency exposures.
c Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, as defined in section a above, at 31 December 2003 was as follows: 2003 2002 m m In one year or less 563 726 In more than one year but not more than two years 151 548 In more than two years but not more than five years 907 792 In more than five years 312 44 1,933 2,110 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 97 notes relating to the accounts 37 Financial risk management continued d Borrowing facilities Committed facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2003 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2003 2002 m m Expiring in one year or less 100 201 Expiring in more than one year 883 Expiring in more than two years 777 425 877 1,509 e Net debt management The Group manages the currency and interest rate exposure which arises on borrowings and cash not immediately required by the business on a net basis through the use of currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The most significant consequences of this approach are: to manage the currency exposures arising from loans by holding cash and through currency swaps.
to reduce the proportion of the Groups fixed interest rate liabilities arising from loans through the use of fixed to floating rate swaps.
The financial instruments used in debt management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 52 and 53.
The notional principal amounts and fair values, net of associated hedges, of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities were as follows: Notional principal amounts Carrying values Fair values At 31 December At 31 December At 31 December 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m m m Interests in participating and other investments other investments 32 17 32 17 32 17 Current asset investments and short-term deposits 260 54 260 54 260 54 Cash 235 264 235 264 235 264 Other financial assets 27 31 27 31 27 31 Short-term borrowings 28 224 29 226 29 224 Loans 1,836 1,850 1,834 1,848 1,940 2,010 Other financial liabilities 18 21 17 21 18 21 Currency swaps 605 814 53 15 21 27 Interest rate swaps 3,215 3,485 17 36 Total net liabilities 1,379 1,744 1,437 1,826 Financial assets 554 Financial liabilities 1,933 1,379 liability The Group has assumed that the fair value approximates to the carrying value.
The fair value of the Groups debt, all swaps, and caps have been estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve.
The total decrease in the fair value of long-term debt net of associated hedges for the year ended 31 December 2003 of 70m arose from the net addition to loans 102m, favourable movements on foreign exchange 115m and favourable movements due to changes in interest rates 57m.
A portfolio approach is adopted to create the Groups target proportion of fixed and floating rate debt by currency.
The maturity profile of the net fixed rate exposure is spread over several years to reduce re-pricing risk.
Short term borrowings include balances relating to forward exchange contracts.
These balances are further analysed in section g. Where interest rate and currency instruments are designated to a group of borrowings or cash and cash equivalents with similar characteristics, altering their interest rate or currency profile, the net cash amounts to be received or paid on the agreements are accrued in current assets or liabilities and recognised as an adjustment to interest income or expense accrual accounting.
98 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 37 Financial risk management continued e Net debt management continued The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event that counterparties to off-balance-sheet financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract.
In the opinion of management, the counterparties to the financial instruments are creditworthy parties and the Group does not expect any significant loss to result from non-performance.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at 31 December 2003.
At 31 December 2003 the aggregate value of all financial instruments with a positive fair value assets was 57m for currency swaps, 54m for interest rate swaps, 17m for forward contracts, nil for interest rate caps and 6m for currency options.

The Group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures for up to 12 months ahead through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and selective purchase of currency options.
Surplus funds are invested in instruments in a variety of currencies.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge these back to the currencies that are appropriate for the net debt portfolio.
The financial instruments used in currency management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 52 and 53.
The notional principal amounts and fair values of forward exchange and currency option contracts used in currency management are as follows: Notional principal amounts Carrying values Fair values At 31 December At 31 December At 31 December 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m m m Hedging working capital 1 1 1 1 Forward contracts to buy currency 118 99 Forward contracts to sell currency 118 96 Hedging anticipated cash flows 3 6 7 6 Currency contracts to buy currency 92 97 Currency contracts to sell currency 84 88 Hedging debt 12 4 12 4 Forward contracts to buy currency 1,018 617 Forward contracts to sell currency 1,030 620 liability ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 99 notes relating to the accounts 37 Financial risk management continued h Management of current asset investments Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including money market instruments, government securities and asset backed securities.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded interest rate options.
The majority of asset backed securities have some risk of early redemption, but are of a floating rate nature and hence have minimal fixed interest rate risk.
There are no investments of a fixed rate nature with maturity greater than one year and consequently the fair value of investments is considered to be materially the same as the value in the Groups balance sheet.
Investments are classified as available for sale.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, which is reviewed annually, and reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value.

The over-arching principle clearly states that strategic asset allocation should be determined through explicit consideration of each plans specific liability profile and funding level and and not by local common practice.
Furthermore, all plans must establish a strategic asset allocation benchmark, a relevant total plan performance benchmark and a process for controlling deviations from the strategic asset allocation benchmark.
Pension funds are expected to invest in a diversified range of asset classes and investment managers.
These assets may include derivatives up to a maximum of 10% of the individual fund unless a higher percentage is agreed after consultation with the Company.
However, no self-investment is permitted.
Whilst the Company expects to be consulted on these strategic and other matters, it recognises that final responsibility for establishing investment strategy often rests with local fiduciaries, who do not publish target allocations to asset classes.
The best estimate of amounts expected to be contributed to pension plans during 2004 is 141m.
The best estimate of amounts expected to be contributed to other post retirement benefit plans in 2004 is 12m.
