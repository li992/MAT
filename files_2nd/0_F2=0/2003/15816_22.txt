30.1 339.6 329.6 208.6 Tomkins adopted SFAS No.
As a result there was no goodwill amortisation charged to operating profit in the twelve months ended 3 January 2004 under US GAAP, whilst the twelve months ended 31 December 2002 included goodwill amortisation of $17.7 million eight months ended 31 December 2002 $nil.
For the twelve months ended 3 January 2004 there was a goodwill impairment charge of $53.9 million eight months and twelve months ended 31 December 2002 $49.7 million, following the initial impairment charge on adoption of the standard discussed in note C. $41.4 million eight months and twelve months ended 31 December 2002 $19.6 million of this impairment relates to discontinued operations, and therefore is not included in operating profit from continuing operations.
B Net income per common share Basic net income per common share is calculated on net income attributable to common shareholders of $401.1 million December 2002 12 months $145.6 million and December 2002 8 months $81.3 million, representing the net income for the period after adjusting for the preference dividend of $47.1 million December 2002 12 months $51.6 million and December 2002 8 months $37.5 million, and on 771,037,499 ordinary shares being the weighted average in issue during the period December 2002 12 months 770,569,165 and December 2002 8 months 770,927,221.
Diluted net income per common share is calculated on an adjusted weighted average number of ordinary shares of 953,988,852 December 2002 12 months 996,233,827 and December 2002 8 months 996,606,935 after allowing for the exercise of 2,034,111 share options December 2002 12 months 1,470,913 and December 2002 8 months 1,498,374 and is calculated on net income of $430.8 million December 2002 12 months $197.2 million and December 2002 8 months $118.8 million.
The weighted average number of shares also allows for the conversion of preference shares equating to 180,917,242 ordinary shares for the year ended 3 January 2004 December 2002 12 months 224,193,749 and December 2002 8 months 224,181,340 and income was adjusted for the preference dividend of $47.1 million December 2002 12 months $51.6 million and December 2002 8 months $37.5 million and the gain on redemption of the redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares of $17.4 million.
C Changes of accounting principle SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets With effect from 1 May 2002, Tomkins adopted SFAS No.
142, which requires, inter alia, that goodwill should no longer be amortised but should be subject to an impairment review initially on adoption of the standard and, thereafter, at least on an annual basis.
As a result of the initial impairment review, an impairment loss of 32.7 million $47.3 million was recognised as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on 1 May 2002.
Since the initial impairment review, further impairment losses of 30.0 million $53.9 million 31 December 2002 30.9 million $49.7 million have been recognised.
