Notes to the Financial Statements | 63 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2003 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PREPARATION GROUP The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain assets as required by the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards.
A summary of the significant Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on adoption of new accounting standards issued during the year.
The accounting policies adopted reflect applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP which includes UK accounting standards, Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstracts and companies legislation.
The Groups operations include life assurance, general insurance, asset management and banking.
Due to the diverse nature of the operations, these are separately disclosed where it is considered appropriate.
The results and balance sheet of the Groups insurance and asset management operations have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 225A of, and the special provisions relating to insurance companies of Schedule 9A to, the Companies Act 1985 and with the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers in December 1998 the ABI SORP.
The results of the Groups banking operations have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 9 Special Provisions for Banking Companies and Groups to the Companies Act 1985 and the British Bankers Association Statements of Recommended Practice SORPs on Advances 1997, Securities 1990, Derivatives 2001, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 1996 and Segmental Reporting 1993.
This disclosure takes the form of the non-technical banking profit and loss account, separation of banking items within the consolidated balance sheet and appropriate notes to the financial statements.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the adoption of UITF Abstract 37 Purchases and Sales of Own Shares.
The abstract requires the Groups holdings of its own shares to be accounted for as a deduction in arriving at equity shareholders funds, rather than to be recorded as an asset.
In addition, purchases and sales of own shares should be shown as changes in equity shareholders funds such that no profit or loss is recognised in respect of dealings in those shares.
The Group holds shares in the Company through a number of its long term business funds for the benefit of policyholders.
These shares were previously included within Other financial investments at market value.
Dividends paid have been restated to exclude any dividends in respect of own shares.
This change has resulted in an increase in operating profit after tax for the year to 31 December 2002 of 42 million R663 million representing net investment losses on own shares held in policyholders funds.
Basic earnings per share has been restated to reflect a reduction in the weighted average number of shares in issue of 316 million during 2002.
The reduction in equity shareholders funds at 31 December 2002 as a result of the new policy was 262 million R3,618 million, made up of the original cost of the shares on demutualisation of 401 million R3,908 million and the cumulative investment loss and foreign exchange movements on the shares to the end of 2002 of 139 million R290 million.
In addition, dividends paid have been restated to exclude dividends in respect of own shares, resulting in an overall increase in retained profit for the year to 31 December 2002 of 57 million R900 million.
Full details of the changes are set out in notes 3, 4, 5 b iv, 6 and 27.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Group accounts include the assets, liabilities and results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
All intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation, except for certain fees negotiated on an arms length basis between operationally and functionally distinct segments of the Group.
Elimination of these fees would result in a misleading presentation of the segmental results.
These fees are described in more detail in note 42.
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting rights, and over which it exercises significant influence.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates outside the long term business fund is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Investments in associated undertakings attributable to long term business are accounted for as investments.
The results of the Groups US life assurance subsidiaries are determined initially using United States Generally Accepted Accounting Practice US GAAP bases of accounting with subsequent adjustments where necessary to comply with the Groups accounting and other business policies.
In accordance with the ABI SORP, policyholder liabilities of the Groups US life subsidiaries are incorporated into the Groups accounts on a US GAAP basis.
For investment accounting, however, the US GAAP results are adjusted to comply with UK GAAP.
64 | Notes to the Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2003 CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The segmental disclosure of results by geography is determined by the origin of business transacted.
This is not materially different to the segmental disclosure determined by market destination.
Business transacted with South African residents in terms of their personal offshore allowances is conducted by the Groups offshore companies and is therefore disclosed under the Rest of World segment.
BASIS OF PREPARATION COMPANY The Companys balance sheet has been prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from presenting its own profit and loss account.
No note of historical cost profits and losses has been prepared, as the Companys only material gains or losses on assets relate to the holding and disposal of Company investments.
Shares in subsidiary undertakings are included in the Company balance sheet at historical cost, adjusted for any permanent impairment.
INSURANCE BUSINESS i Investments Investments, including those classified under assets held to cover linked liabilities, are stated at their current value.
Listed investments are stated at year-end market value.
Unlisted investments are valued, on a prudent basis, by the directors having regard to their likely realisable value.
Investments in own shares held in policyholders funds have been deducted from equity shareholders funds.
Investment properties are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 19 as follows: a Investment properties are revalued annually at open market values by internal professional valuers.
Surpluses and deficits arising are taken to the profit and loss account for the year.
b No depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years to run.
This treatment, as regards certain of the Groups investment properties, may be a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption, but for investment, and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Securities borrowed and lent that are collateralised by cash are included in the balance sheet at amounts equal to the collateral advanced or received.
ii Investment return Investment return comprises investment income, realised gains and losses and changes in unrealised gains and losses, net of investment expenses and charges, excluding net investment return on investment in own shares held in policyholders funds.
Dividends on equity investments are accrued on an ex-dividend basis.
Interest on fixed income securities, net rental income from property investments and investment expenses are recorded on an accruals basis.
Realised gains and losses represent the difference between net sales proceeds and purchase price.
Unrealised gains and losses represent the difference between the valuation of investments at the balance sheet date and their original cost, or if they have been previously valued, their valuation at the last balance sheet date.
Movements in unrealised gains and losses are recorded in the profit and loss account, and include an adjustment for previously recognised unrealised gains and losses on investments disposed during the reporting period.
Income arising from securities lending and borrowing is recognised in the non-technical account on an accruals basis over the term of the related loans.
For long term business, an allocation is made from the long term business technical account to the non-technical account, representing the difference between the long term investment return and the actual return on shareholder assets supporting the long term business.
The long term investment return for relevant categories of investments takes into account past performance, current trends and future expectations.
Notes to the Financial Statements | 65 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued For the US long term business, due to the nature of its products, investment risk is borne by the shareholders.
Therefore, in determining the operating profit for the business, the investment return earned by the whole of the portfolio is smoothed on the basis of a market rate appropriate to the portfolio of investments, management philosophy and US market conditions for each reporting period.
The long term investment return on investments supporting general insurance technical provisions and related shareholders funds is allocated from the non-technical account to the general business technical account.
LONG TERM BUSINESS The results are prepared on a modified statutory solvency basis, as set out in the ABI SORP.
The main features of this basis are outlined below.
i Premiums Premiums and annuity considerations are stated gross of commission, exclude taxes and levies and are accounted for when due for payment, except for unit-linked premiums which are accounted for when the liability is established.
Outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for on a payable basis.
ii Claims Claims paid include maturities, annuities, surrenders, death and disability.
Maturity and annuity claims are recorded as they fall due for payment.
Death and disability claims and surrenders are accounted for when notified.
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
iii Long term business provision Long term business provisions for South African and other African businesses have been computed using a gross premium valuation method.
Provisions in respect of South African business have been made in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis as set out in the guidelines issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa in Prudential Guidance Note PGN 104 2001.
Under this guideline, provisions are valued using realistic expectations of future experience, with prescribed margins for prudence and deferral of profit emergence.
This method makes implicit allowance for deferred acquisition costs.
Technical provisions supporting linked policies reflect the market value of assets supporting these liabilities.
For the US business, the long term business provision is calculated using the net premium method, based on assumptions as to investment yields, mortality, withdrawals and policyholder dividends.
Assumptions are set at the time the contract is issued.
Universal life and deferred annuity reserves are computed on the retrospective deposit method, which produces reserves equal to the cash value of the contracts.
Reserves on immediate annuities and guaranteed payments are computed on the prospective deposit method, which produces reserves equal to the present value of future benefit payments.
For other territories, the valuation bases adopted are in accordance with local actuarial practices and methodologies.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross long term business provision and the related reinsurance recovery are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
The provision estimation techniques and assumptions are periodically reviewed, with any changes in estimates reflected in the long term business technical account as they occur.
66 | Notes to the Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2003 CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued LONG TERM BUSINESS continued iv Acquisition costs Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the sale of insurance contracts.
As the gross premium valuation method used in South Africa and other African territories to determine the long term business provision makes implicit allowance for the deferral of acquisition costs, no explicit deferred acquisition cost asset has been included in the balance sheet for these businesses.
For the US life business, an explicit deferred acquisition costs asset has been established in the balance sheet.
Deferred acquisition costs are amortised over the period that profits on the related insurance policies are expected to emerge.
Acquisition costs are deferred to the extent that they are deemed recoverable from available future profit margins.
Deferral of costs on other long term business is limited to the extent that there are available future margins.
v Present value of acquired in-force business The present value of acquired in-force business is calculated by performing a cash flow projection of the long term fund and the in-force policies in order to estimate future after-tax profits attributable to shareholders.
These profits are then discounted at a rate of return allowing for the risk of uncertainty of the future cash flows.
This calculation is particularly sensitive to the assumptions regarding discount rate, future investment returns and the rate at which policies discontinue.
The present value of acquired in-force business is capitalised in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset and amortised over the expected profit recognition period on a systematic basis over the anticipated lives of the related contracts which the directors consider to be 30 years.
The amortisation charge is stated net of any unwind in the discount rate used to calculate the asset.
The carrying value of the asset is reviewed annually for impairment.
The amortisation charge and any adjustments to reflect impairments are recorded in the long term business technical account under Other technical charges.
GENERAL INSURANCE BUSINESS All classes of general insurance business are accounted for on an annual basis.
i Premiums Premiums are stated gross of commissions, exclude taxes and levies and are accounted for in the period in which the risk commences.
The proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of risk after the balance sheet date is carried forward to subsequent accounting periods as unearned premiums, so that earned premiums relate to risks carried during the accounting period.
Outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the related direct insurance.
ii Claims Claims incurred comprise the settlement and handling costs of paid and outstanding claims arising during the year and adjustments to prior year claim provisions.
Outstanding claims comprise claims incurred up to, but not paid, at the end of the accounting period, whether reported or not.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events, and may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the adjustments are made, and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used and estimates made are reviewed regularly.
iii Acquisition costs Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred and amortised over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Notes to the Financial Statements | 67 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued BANKING BUSINESS i Banking income Interest receivable and payable are recognised in the banking non-technical account as they accrue.
Fee and other income is recognised in the banking non-technical account when receivable, except where it is charged to cover the costs of a continuing service to, or risk borne for, the customer.
In these cases, the income is recognised over the relevant period.
Other operating income is derived from township development and computer-related services, including distribution and servicing of equipment.
The net income from these activities is accounted for on the accruals basis and included within Other operating income.
ii Advances and provisions for doubtful debts Certain advances are held for trading purposes and are not held to maturity.
Such advances are held in the balance sheet at fair value and any change in the fair value of these instruments is accounted for through the profit and loss account.
All operating companies make provisions for bad and doubtful debts where required on a prudent basis.
Advances are designated as nonperforming based on credit risk management tools and indicators as well as management judgement as to the ultimate collectability of the principal or interest.
When an advance is designated as non-performing, interest is suspended and specific provisions raised where required.
There are two basic types of provision, specific and general, each of which is assessed in terms of the charge and the amount outstanding.
The provisions made during the year, less recoveries of advances previously written off, are charged to the profit and loss account.
During the year, the Group implemented a revised methodology for the calculation of credit provisions for loans and advances as set out in note 5 d iii.
The accounting policies below incorporate the revised methodology.
The Group creates a specific provision for impairment when there is objective evidence that it will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of such impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount, calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, including amounts recoverable from guarantees and collateral, discounted at the effective interest rate of the advance.
The Group creates an additional general provision where there is objective evidence that components of the advances portfolio contain probable losses at the balance sheet date, which will only be identified in the future.
The estimated probable losses are based on historical information and take into account historical patterns of losses in each component, the credit ratings allocated to the borrowers and the current economic climate in which the borrowers operate.
Provisions are deducted from advances in the balance sheet.
Interest on non-performing loans is charged to the customers account and recorded as income, provided that there is a realistic prospect of interest being paid at some future date.
However, where interest to be recovered is considered to be doubtful, the interest is suspended and is not credited to income but to an interest reserve account in the balance sheet, which is included as part of specific provisions and deducted from advances in the balance sheet.
Where the probability of receiving interest payments is remote, interest is no longer accrued.
iii Instalment transactions Instalment credit agreements are regarded as financing transactions and total instalments, less unearned finance charges, are included in loans and advances.
Lease income and finance charges are determined at the commencement of the contractual periods and are recognised in income in proportion to the net cash investment capital balances outstanding.
Unearned lease income and finance charges are carried forward as deferred income and deducted from advances.
iv Investments Securities which are intended to be held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for differences between cost and redemption value which are amortised over the period to redemption date.
Securities held for trading purposes are marked to market value and the related gains and losses are taken directly to the banking non-technical profit and loss account as they arise.
Other investments are stated at cost and provision is made where, in the opinion of the directors, there has been a permanent impairment in value.
Freehold and leasehold buildings and buildings occupied for own use are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Unsold properties in possession are included under advances and valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost includes the outstanding balance on repossession, which may or may not include capitalised interest incurred by the client, together with other charges relating to the repossession.
Where securities sold under agreements to repurchase at future dates are recorded in the financial statements, the corresponding liability to repurchase those securities is included in deposits from banks or customers as appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell at future dates are treated as secured loans and reflected on the balance sheet.
Profits and losses arising from these transactions are treated as interest and accounted for over the period of the contracts.
Acceptances, promissory notes, trade and other bills drawn by customers and discounted by banking subsidiaries are included under advances.
Amounts rediscounted are included under the contra items for liabilities under acceptances.
68 | Notes to the Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2003 CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued BANKING BUSINESS continued v Debt securities in issue and subordinated debt instruments issued Premiums and discounts incurred in the issue of debt securities and fixed rate subordinated liabilities are accounted for as an adjustment to the amount of the liability and amortised over the relevant period to maturity.
vi Financial instruments Financial instruments on the balance sheet include cash and bank balances, investments, receivables and trade creditors.
These instruments are generally carried at fair value and the accounting treatment for each is disclosed in the accounting policy note for that particular balance.
In addition the banking business uses a variety of derivative financial instruments including forwards, swaps, options and exchange traded financial futures.
Transactions in the foreign exchange, interest rate and equity markets are negotiated directly with customers, with the banking business acting as a counterparty, or can be dealt directly through exchanges.
Accounting for financial instruments is dependent on whether the transactions are undertaken for trading or non-trading purposes: a Trading activities Trading transactions include transactions undertaken for market-making, to service customers needs and for propriety purposes, as well as any related hedges.
Transactions undertaken for trading purposes are measured at fair value, including an allowance for credit and market risk, and the resulting profits and losses are accounted for in the non-technical account.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices when available.
Where no quoted prices are available for a particular derivative, its fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for its component parts.
b Non-trading activities Non-trading transactions are those that are held for hedging purposes as part of the banking businesss overall risk management strategy as a means of managing exposure to price, foreign currency and interest rate risk.
To qualify as a hedge: a the transaction must be reasonably expected to match or eliminate a significant proportion of the risk inherent in the assets, liabilities, other positions or cashflows being hedged and which results from potential movements in interest rates, exchange rates and market values, both at the inception and over the life of the contract: b adequate evidence of the intention to hedge and linkage with the underlying risk inherent in the assets, liabilities, other positions or cashflows being hedged, must be established at the start of the transaction: and c there must be a continual assessment of whether the market value of the hedge instrument matches the market value of the hedged item.
If these criteria are met, the derivative is accounted for in the non-technical account on the same basis and over the same period as the underlying hedged item to which it relates.
Qualifying hedges, which cease to be effective or are terminated prior to the end of the life of the underlying hedged item, are measured at fair value and transferred to the trading portfolio.
Any resulting gain or loss is deferred and amortised to earnings over the original life of the underlying item.
Off balance sheet financial instruments are measured on a basis consistent with on balance sheet instruments.
Potential losses arising on these instruments are recognised as contingent liabilities.
Where the banking business has entered into legally binding contracts with a counterparty that permits offsets, positive and negative values of derivatives are offset within the balance sheet totals.
ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS Asset management revenue includes gross fees and commissions which are credited as earned.
Performance fees are recognised once all contractual obligations have been satisfied and the fees are expected to be collected.
Any fees collected in advance are deferred and recognised as income over the period earned.
Expenses are recognised as they are incurred.
Notes to the Financial Statements | 69 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued ALL BUSINESSES i Tax Tax is charged on all taxable profits arising during the year and is determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation.
The tax charge attributable to long term business includes the tax expense for both policyholders and shareholders, at rates applicable to those parties.
The tax attributable to shareholders profits on long term business, calculated at the effective tax rate of the underlying businesses, is added to the balance on the long term business technical account to present life assurance profits on a pre-tax basis, and is then included in the tax expense on profit on ordinary activities in the non-technical account.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition for tax purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are fully recognised and deferred tax assets are recognised when the Group believes it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on an undiscounted basis.
ii Goodwill Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given for acquired businesses and associated costs over the fair value of net assets acquired is capitalised and amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life, normally 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in value.
In determining if any impairment is required, recoverable amounts are assessed on a value in use basis.
Where businesses are acquired as part of the same investment, these are combined for the purposes of determining recoverability of the related goodwill.
Adjustments to reflect an impairment in value are recognised in the non-technical account in the period in which the impairment is determined.
iii Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets, principally computer equipment and software, motor vehicles, fixtures and furniture, are capitalised and depreciated by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives.
iv General provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will occur, and where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the effect of discounting is material, provisions are discounted and the discount rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
v Pension plans and post retirement benefits Defined benefit and defined contribution schemes have been established for eligible employees of the Group with the assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
For defined benefit schemes, pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the related charges over the service lives of employees and are determined by independent qualified actuaries undertaking formal actuarial valuations at least every three years.
The effects of variations from regular cost are spread over the expected average remaining service lives of members of the scheme.
Any difference between the amounts charged against profits and the amounts contributed to schemes is included as a prepayment or provision in the balance sheet.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes are recognised when incurred.
Certain Group companies make provision for post retirement medical and housing benefits for eligible employees.
The expected costs of post retirement benefits are charged over the expected working lives of eligible employees.
vi Employee share ownership plans The Group offers share award and option plans to management and certain key employees.
The Group offers Save As You Earn plans for all UK-based employees of participating Group companies.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report.
The assets, liabilities, income and expenses of employee share ownership plans ESOPs are incorporated into the financial statements.
Own shares held in ESOP Trusts are recognised as current assets in the balance sheet and amortised over the vesting period.
70 | Notes to the Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2003 CONTINUED 2FOREIGN CURRENCIES The information contained in these financial statements is expressed in both Sterling and South African Rand.
This is in order both to meet the legal requirements of the UK Companies Act 1985 and to provide the users of the accounts in South Africa with illustrative information.
The principal exchange rates used to translate the operating results, assets and liabilities of key foreign business segments to Sterling are: Rand US$ 2003 2002 2003 2002 Profit and loss account average rate 12.3487 15.7878 1.6354 1.5030 Balance sheet closing rate 11.9367 13.8141 1.7833 1.6105 Foreign currency revenue transactions are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign subsidiary undertakings are taken to the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign integrated operations are taken through the non-technical account.
Exchange differences on trading activities are included in the profit and loss account.
3 EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated based upon the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders.
The directors view is that adjusted operating earnings per share derived from adjusted operating profit or loss after tax and minority interests provides a better indication of the underlying performance of the Group.
For life assurance and general insurance businesses, adjusted operating profit is based on a long term investment return and includes investment returns on own shares held in policyholders funds.
For banking business, adjusted operating profit excludes the loss on disposal of investment in Dimension Data Holdings plc, Nedcor restructuring and integration costs and the transitional impact of the change in credit provisioning methodology.
For all businesses, adjusted operating profit excludes goodwill amortisation and impairment.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is similarly based, but is stated after tax and minority interests, with the calculation of the weighted average number of shares including own shares held in policyholders funds.
A table reconciling operating profit on ordinary activities after tax and minority interests to adjusted operating profit and tax and minority interests is set out below.

As a consequence of the exchange control arrangements in place in South Africa and other relevant African territories, dividends to shareholders on the branch registers in those countries or in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register are settled through Dividend Access Trusts established for that purpose.

The revised methodology requiring the discounting of future cash flows on advances is acceptable under UK GAAP reporting and has therefore been adopted in preparation of the Groups financial statements, resulting in a one-off increase in opening specific provisions due to the discounting effect.
Further investigation of the transitional adjustment following publication of the 2003 interim results has resulted in an increased charge of 9 million R111 million.
This adjustment has been taken to the profit and loss account in the Groups financial statements, but excluded from adjusted operating profit.

For the South African and Namibian long term business, the return is applied to an average value of investible shareholders assets.
For general insurance business, the return is an average value of investible assets supporting shareholders funds and insurance liabilities.
For the US long term business, the return earned by assets, mainly bonds, has been smoothed with reference to the actual yield earned by the portfolio.
Short term fluctuations in investment return represent the difference between actual return and long term investment return.
The long term rates of investment return for equities and other investible assets are as follows: Year to Year to 31 December 31 December 2003 2002 South Africa and Namibian long term and general insurance businesses weighted average return 13.4% 14.0% Equities 14.0% 14.0% Cash and other investible assets Rand denominated 12.5% Cash and other investible assets other currencies 9.0% United States 6.04% 6.46% The long term rates of return are based on achieved real rates of return adjusted for current inflation expectations and consensus economic investment forecasts, and are reviewed annually for appropriateness.
The directors are of the opinion that these rates of return are appropriate and have been selected with a view to ensuring that returns credited to operating earnings are not inconsistent with the actual returns expected to be earned over the long term.
Changes to the composition of investments have resulted in an increase in the cash and other investible assets held as a proportion of total investible assets in South Africa and Namibia resulting in a weighted average return being applied for 2003.

These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs and contributions relating to defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Actuarial advice confirms that the current level of contributions payable to each pension scheme, together with existing assets, are adequate to secure members benefits over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
In the intervening years, the actuary reviews the continuing appropriateness of the assumptions applied.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.

This means that the assumptions used for valuing liabilities are based on realistic expectations of future experience, plus prescribed margins for prudence and further second-tier margins to ensure that profits are released appropriately over the term of each policy.
The assets and liabilities have been valued on bases that are consistent with each other.
Where applicable, liabilities include provision for maturity and investment guarantees.
Certain individual life mortality assumptions have been revised reflecting on-going favourable experience.
Where applicable, allowance has been made for bonuses already declared, as well as future bonuses still to be declared at rates consistent with the assumed valuation interest rates.
These bonuses include both vested bonuses and non-vested terminal bonuses.
The valuation is sensitive to the rate of interest used to discount the liabilities, assumed future mortality experience of policyholders and the level of second-tier margins.
The principal assumptions used at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 for the long term business are set out below.
Rates of interest gross of tax and charges Mortality tables used Non-profit annuities Discounted on appropriate spot yield curve RMV92 with a percentage of CMI improvements adjusted for own experience With-profit annuities Interest rate on which premiums were based PA90 adjusted in line with own experience Assurances 11.0 per cent.
per annum for all years Tables derived from own experience with allowance 2002: 14.0 per cent.
for increasing AIDS claims Notes to the Financial Statements | 111 31 TECHNICAL PROVISIONS continued The gross interest rates were reduced as follows, where applicable: to allow for tax: to allow for the minimum margin of 0.25 per cent.
per annum, as prescribed by the ASSA: in the case of smoothed bonus business, by an additional margin equal to the excess over the 0.25 per cent.
of the capital charges applicable to the business.
This second-tier margin is incorporated to ensure that the value of capital charges emerge as profit over the full duration of the policy: and in the case of certain non-profit annuities to allow for imperfect matching of assets and liabilities.
For assurances, the above underlying mortality rates were further increased by the prescribed ASSA margin of 7.5 per cent.
For annuities, the mortality rates were reduced by the prescribed ASSA margin of 7.5 per cent.
Renewal expenses Renewal expense assumptions including renewal commissions have been based on recent experience, inflating at 8.0 per cent.
In terms of the prescribed ASSA margins, the underlying expense assumption was increased by 10.0 per cent.
and the expense inflation assumption was increased to 8.8 per cent.
2002: 12.1 per cent.. Surrenders lapses Where appropriate, allowance has been made for surrenders and lapses at rates consistent with past experience.
The underlying lapse rates were then increased by the prescribed ASSA margin of 25 per cent.
Surrender rates were increased or decreased by the prescribed ASSA margin of 10 per cent.
depending on which alternative gave rise to an increase in liabilities.
UNITED STATES Valuation methods and assumptions The valuation was performed using the applicable standards for US GAAP products in keeping with the applicable professional guidance notes issued by the American Academy of Actuaries.
This means that the assumptions used for valuing liabilities are based on realistic expectations of future experience to ensure that profits are realised appropriately over the term of each policy.
The valuation is sensitive to the rate of interest used to discount the liabilities, assumed future mortality experience of policyholders and assumed policyholder lapse experience.
Rates of interest gross of tax and charges Mortality tables used All products 2003: 6.40 per cent.
per annum 75-80 SU Table with appropriate modifiers 2002: 7.15 per cent.
per annum The gross interest rates were reduced for investment default assumptions and investment expenses.
Renewal expenses Renewal expense assumptions including renewal commissions have been based on projected costs with an assumed inflation rate of 3 per cent.

During 2003, in response to enquiries initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and the office of the New York Attorney General NYAG, one of the Groups US asset management affiliates, Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd PBA, conducted an internal review that identified certain alleged market timing activities that had previously occurred in some of the funds managed by PBA.
During the course of its review, PBA learned of certain activities, now alleged to be improper, involving the former principals of that firm.
PBA promptly notified the SEC and NYAG of its findings.
The SEC and NYAG have filed civil suits against PBA and the two former principals.
In addition, there are several related private lawsuits arising from the facts alleged by the SEC and NYAG.
As discussions with the regulators are still continuing and the related litigation is still at an early stage, it is not currently possible to say whether or not the amount of the ultimate liability to be borne by the Group will be material.
Included within Other provisions and Other creditors is 10 million R119 million in respect of legal fees, investigation costs and other expenses associated with these events.
No amount has been recognised for fines or other penalties which may arise, as significant uncertainty remains over the quantum of any settlement.
Other provisions relate to provisions for impairment of various overseas life operations within the Group, warranty provisions in respect of businesses sold, employee obligations and onerous property leases.

Notes to the Financial Statements | 131 46 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued 46 f Market risk historical value-at-risk VaR 99%, one day by risk type This risk measure estimates the potential loss in pre-tax profit over a given holding period for a specified confidence level.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-based approach that takes account of market volatilities as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.
The one day 99% VaR number represents the overnight loss that has less than a 1% chance of occurring under normal market conditions.
While VaR captures the banking businesss exposure under normal market conditions, scenario analysis and, in particular, stress testing are used to add insight to the possible outcomes under abnormal market conditions.
The banking business uses a number of stress scenarios to measure the impact on portfolio values of extreme moves in markets, based on historical experience as well as hypothetical scenarios.
The stress test methodology assumes that all market factors move adversely at the same time and that no actions are taken during the stress events to mitigate risk, thereby reflecting the decreased liquidity that frequently accompanies market shocks.
Key to the effectiveness of the scenario analysis programme is the timely review of the continued applicability of the scenarios, and this is built into the risk management process.
