Professor Peter Winstanley University of Liverpool Lapdap a new anti-malarial for subSaharan Africa Malaria affects more than 300 million people every year.
There is an urgent need for new affordable treatments to combat the disease and to deal with the problem of resistance to existing treatments.
The new anti-malarial treatment, Lapdap, launched in 2003, is designed to tackle this deadly disease.
It was developed specifically for use in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria kills more than one million people every year, the majority of whom are children under five.
The initiative brought together GSK Drug Development researchers with scientists in Africa, and two leading UK medical schools the University of Liverpool and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
GSK, the WHO and the UK Government Department for International Development jointly funded the development project.
Lapdap was approved for use by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and, in line with best medical practice, GSK is conducting postmarketing studies in Africa to confirm the long-term safety of the treatment.
GSK is registering Lapdap across sub-Saharan Africa, where it will be available to national malaria control programmes at preferential prices.
The treatment is already registered in 14 African countries.
We are also developing CDA, a new Lapdap plus artesunate combination therapy, with the WHO and the Medicines for Malaria Venture.
Corporate Responsibility Report 2003 13 Community investment The Childrens Health Fund's Referral Management Initiative Homeless and disadvantaged children are especially vulnerable to illness and are more likely to suffer from acute and chronic illnesses such as asthma.
Many do not receive vaccinations.
Despite needing more specialist care, it is difficult for these families to keep hospital appointments.
Millions of children in the US cannot access the healthcare they need because of a lack of transport, too few doctors in disadvantaged communities, or cultural, language and institutional barriers.
A transient lifestyle often means they lose contact with their doctor.
Over nine years, GSK has provided $4.2 million to the Childrens Health Fund to set up and run a Referral Management 19 Initiative RMI.
This helps children, referred to a specialist, attend their appointments and receive the care they need.
The RMI reminds families about appointments by phone and mail, provides door-to-door transport to clinics and helps communications, including providing a translation service where necessary.
GSK is sole funder of the RMI.
In 2003 we provided additional funding of $756,000 to help extend the programme and develop guidance for introducing similar initiatives nationwide.
The RMI has dramatically increased the number of children who see a medical specialist after being referred.
Approximately 75% of the children in the programme are now getting the specialist care they need, compared with just 5% when the initiative began.
The Childrens Health Fund partnership with GSK has been responsible for positively transforming the lives of tens of thousands of medically under-served children in need of specialist care.

20 Corporate Responsibility report 2003 4 Environment health & safety nt safety Technological changes improve materials recovery New technology can help improve our environmental performance.
GSKs manufacturing site at Ulverston in the UK has introduced a new membrane filtration system that has reduced hazardous waste by 50 tonnes and emissions of VOCs by 3 tonnes per annum.
The new system saves the site around 1 million a year.
Ulverston is one of our largest primary manufacturing plants with over 600 staff on a 60-acre site.
It is situated near the Lake District, an area of natural beauty and ecological importance.
The plant makes active ingredients for many of our antibiotics.
Acetone, a VOC, is used as a solvent during manufacturing when axetil, an oral antibiotic, is spray dried.
This process ensures the medicines can be absorbed efficiently from the stomach and gut into the patients bloodstream.
Acetone is also used to wash the equipment used in processing.
Antibiotic residue in the acetone is valuable and needs to be recovered before disposal of the acetone.
Previously this was done in a remote area of the site but the system was inefficient so a lot of the product was wasted.
Acetone is highly flammable so pumping it across the site created a potential health and safety risk.
In 2002 the site introduced a new membrane filtration system.
This separates antibiotic from other residues in the acetone, allowing it to be concentrated for more efficient recovery.
As a result of installing the new equipment, the overall process has become much more efficient.
Up to 97% of the antibiotic is now recovered, so there is less waste.
The filtration system was installed next to the production building, reducing the amount of solvent transferred across the site and the health and safety risks.
The site won a GSK CEOs EHS Excellence Award in 2003 for its work in implementing the new system.
