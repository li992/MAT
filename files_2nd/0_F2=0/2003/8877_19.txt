Part of Life Johnston Press Annual Report and Accounts 2003 53 Notes to the ACCOUNTS Year to 31 December 2003 1.
Accounting Policies The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets, and using applicable accounting standards.
No Profit and Loss Account is presented for the Parent Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Of the Group profit for the financial year, 82,323,000 2002 - 89,004,000 is dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Johnston Press plc and all its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The Group has adopted the acquisition method of accounting.
Under this method the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group Profit and Loss Account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
In accordance with FRS10, as from 1 January 1998, goodwill is capitalised.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 1997 and earlier periods was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by the current accounting standard the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Publishing titles Publishing titles separately acquired after 1 January 1989 are stated in the Balance Sheet at cost.
All publishing titles owned by subsidiaries acquired after 1 January 1996 are included in the Balance Sheet at Directors valuation.
The Company has taken the view that these titles have no finite life, and in accordance with the provisions of FRS10 and FRS11 annual impairment tests are undertaken to determine any diminution in value.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment, as set out in note 13.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at varying rates calculated to write off cost or valuation over their useful lives.
The principal rates employed are: 1 Heritable and freehold property excluding land 2 2% on written down value Leasehold land and buildings equal annual instalments over term of lease Web offset presses 5% straight line basis Pre-press systems 20% straight line basis Other plant and machinery 15% on written down value 2 1 6 3%, 10%, 20% and 33 3% straight line basis Motor vehicles 25% straight line basis 25% on written down value Revaluation of properties The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of FRS15 in retaining previously revalued book amounts.
The valuations carried out in 1996 and 1997 will no longer be updated.
Where depreciation charges were increased following a revaluation, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to the Profit and Loss Account as a movement on reserves.
On the disposal or recognition of a provision for impairment of a revalued fixed asset, any related balance remaining in the revaluation reserve is also transferred to the Profit and Loss Account as a movement on reserves.
Fixed asset investments Listed investments are shown at current market valuation.
Upward revaluations are credited to the revaluation reserve.
Downward revaluations in excess of any previous upward revaluation are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Other fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provisions for impairment except for investments in associated undertakings.
In the Group Accounts, investments in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group Accounts include the Groups share of the profit and net assets of associates.
Part of Life 54 Johnston Press Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the ACCOUNTS Year to 31 December 2003 1.
Accounting Policies continued Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value as follows: Cost incurred in bringing materials to their present location and condition comprises: a raw materials and goods for resale at purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis: and b work in progress at cost of direct materials, labour and certain overheads.
Net realisable value comprises selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Leasing Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the Profit and Loss Account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Turnover Turnover represents net invoiced sales to customers excluding value added tax.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
When a debt facility is re-financed, the finance costs of the old facility are written off to the Profit and Loss Account.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to reduce exposure to interest rate and exchange rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest or currency rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment, and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Part of Life Johnston Press Annual Report and Accounts 2003 55 Development grants Development grants are credited to the Profit and Loss Account by equal instalments over 10 years.
Pension costs The Group provides pensions to employees through various schemes.
The expected cost of pensions in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is charged to the Profit and Loss Account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the schemes.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The Group has elected to adopt the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS17.
The cost of contributions to the Groups money purchase scheme is charged to the Profit and Loss Account when incurred.
As required by SSAP 24, provision has been made for unfunded pension commitments, and payments to pensioners in respect of these commitments are charged to the provision.
Further information regarding the Group pension schemes is provided in notes 20 and 25.

Further details of the Groups treasury management policy are given on page 27.
At 31 December 2003, the Group had a multi-option borrowing facility of 510 million that consisted of a 307 million amortising Term Loan and, a Revolving Credit Facility of 203 million both maturing on 12 March 2007, together with a 30 million bilateral overdraft facility.
On 7 January 2003, the previous 100 million 364 day facility was repaid in full, together with a voluntary repayment of 33 million of the Term Loan Facility.
These were replaced by a Private Placement of 10 year Senior Notes.
The undrawn element of the Facilities at 31 December 2003 amounted to 153 million.
The Loan Stock 1999 2006 is part of the 307 million Term Loan Facility and any redemptions over 1 million are funded from additional drawdowns from the Term Loan Facility.
The Private Placement of Senior Notes is made up of 60 million at a fixed rate of 6.3% and $115 million at a fixed rate of 5.75%.
Using hedging agreements, the latter tranche was swapped back into floating sterling to ensure the Group has no exposure to interest rates outside the UK.
The Senior Discount Notes outstanding at 31 December 2003 related to one bond holder within Regional Independent Media Holdings Ltd RIM which did not accept the tender offer made by RIM prior to the Companys acquisition.
The Notes, expiring in 2008, contain no covenants and the total of 319,000 represents the value of the tender offer, thereby including an element of interest.
During 2003, settlements were reached with all holders of the 10.5% Senior notes outstanding at 31 December 2002.
Interest rate profile At 31 December 2003, the Groups financial assets consisted of sterling cash deposits of 4,051,000 2002 - 7,754,000 which are placed on money market at call, 7-day and monthly rates.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities, including the swaps held, at 31 December 2003 was: Borrowings Proportion Total Floating Fixed Floating rate Fixed rate 000 000 000 % % 2003 Total borrowings 422,496 62,496 360,000 15 85 2002 Total borrowings 516,103 63,003 453,100 12 88 The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate borrowings at 31 December 2003 was 5.30% 2002 - 5.06% which is fixed for an average period of 5 years 2002 - 4 years.
The floating rate is Libor plus or minus an agreed margin fixed at maturity intervals which can be monthly, quarterly or half yearly.
The margin is based on the following: a Loan Stock 1999 2004 0.75% below Libor b Loan Stock 1999 2006 1% above Libor c Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility 1.5% above Libor with adjustments dependent on financial ratios.
There is a difference between the book value and fair value, measured under discounted cashflow, of these instruments amounting to 14 million.
The fall in fair value of the swaps would be equally offset by an increase in fair value of the underlying debt.
At 31 December 2003 there were no material unrecognised gains or losses.

Pension Schemes The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Johnston Press Pension Scheme JPPS, which consolidated a number of defined benefit pension schemes in 2001, and the Regional Independent Media Pension Plan RIM.
During 2003, the JPPS was merged with the Johnston Press Lifestyle Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, to form the Johnston Press Pension Plan JPPP.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The financial information provided below relates to the defined benefit elements of the plan.

On the acquisition of Regional Independent Media Holdings Ltd in April 2002, the Group recognised the pension deficit of 8.8 million at 31 December 2001 as a fair value adjustment.
During 2003, the Group made one-off contributions of 7.8 million and 4.8 million to the JPPS and RIM pension plan respectively to ensure that the MFR funding level of both schemes was above 90%.
An increased level of contribution from the employer and employees has been implemented to meet the ongoing funding requirement.
The pension cost charged in the Profit and Loss Account was as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Defined benefit schemes 5,531 3,620 Defined contribution schemes 3,059 3,215 Charged in accounts 8,590 6,835 Actual contributions paid 20,384 9,859 11,794 3,024 Deficit in RIM pension plan provided as a fair value adjustment 8,800 Increase decrease in balance sheet excesses 11,794 5,776 A cumulative excess of 9,949,000 2002 - deficit of 1,845,000 is included within the balance sheet.
Additional disclosures regarding the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are required under the transitional provisions of FRS17 Retirement Benefits and these are set out below.
The disclosures relate to the third year of the transitional provisions.
They provide information which will be necessary for full implementation of FRS17.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2003 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.

These contribution rates have been set for the next three years and were in addition to the one-off Company contributions.
The Schemes are closed Schemes and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
