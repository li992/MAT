52 Notes to Group financial statements 31 DECEMBER 2003 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS Bank deposits, which are not repayable on demand, are treated as short-term investments in accordance with FRS1, Cash flow statements.
Movements in such investments are included under management of liquid resources in the Groups cash flow statement.
STOCK, EXCLUDING LONG-TERM CONTRACTS Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective stock.
LEASES Assets acquired under finance leases are included in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease period or their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease payments are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to give a constant charge on the balance of the capital repayments outstanding.
The cost of operating leases is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are not made on such a basis.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary and joint venture undertakings are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiary and joint venture undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange.
Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by overseas subsidiary and joint venture undertakings are translated into sterling are taken directly to reserves and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Where financing of a foreign subsidiary through long-term loans and deferred trading balances is intended to be as permanent as equity, such loans and inter-company balances are treated as part of the net investment and, as such, any exchange differences arising are dealt with as adjustments to reserves.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS From time to time, the Group attempts to reduce its foreign currency exposure using forward planning of currency requirements for US dollars and UK sterling, and entering into forward rate currency contracts as appropriate see note 22.
The Group does not enter into any other derivative transactions.
Forward currency contracts are valued by taking the difference between the foreign currency amount of the forward contract translated at the forward rate at the date of inception, and the amount translated at the balance sheet rate.
The Group makes certain deposits in foreign currencies for fixed terms known as dual currency deposits, which, at the option of the bank mature in that foreign currency or are converted to sterling at a pre-agreed exchange rate.
These deposits are translated at the lower of the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and the pre-agreed rate implicit in the contract such that the deposit is held at the lower of cost and market value.
Interest is recognised on an accruals basis.
