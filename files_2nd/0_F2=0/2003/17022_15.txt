Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2003 1.
Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting and are made up to the nearest Friday to 28 February each year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Westbury plc and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiary undertakings or businesses acquired during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date on which control passed.
Uniform accounting policies are adopted by the Group and its subsidiary undertakings.
Turnover Group turnover for the year consists of the contract price from legally completed sales of new properties and the sale of land where unconditional contracts have been exchanged.
The purchase of second-hand houses is regarded as an incentive for the sale of new houses.
Subsequent sale of second-hand houses is therefore excluded from turnover.
Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is an undertaking in which the Group has an interest that does not carry on its own business, but acts as a vehicle to facilitate the Groups activities.
The Groups share of profits and losses of joint arrangements is included in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, and the Groups share of their separate assets, liabilities and cash flows is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a participating interest and is jointly controlled under a contractual arrangement.
The Groups share of profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, and the Groups share of their gross assets and gross liabilities is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Since the accounting policies of joint ventures do not necessarily conform in all respects to those by the Group, adjustments are made on consolidation to reflect the accounting policies of the Group.
Intangible fixed assets Intangible assets comprise of purchased goodwill and know-how licences.
Goodwill, being the difference between the price paid for the subsidiary undertakings or businesses acquired and the fair value of their net assets at acquisition, is capitalised on the balance sheet and amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life, being 20 years for the Maunders acquisition in 1998 and 6 years for the Prowting acquisition in 2002.
This goodwill will be subject to impairment reviews in accordance with the provisions of FRS 11.
Goodwill on acquisitions before 28 February 1998 was written off to reserves and has not been reinstated, as permitted under FRS 10.
The know-how licences for Space4 and Incresco are stated at cost less amortisation.
The Space4 know-how licence is amortised based on its expected usage in terms of units produced and the Incresco know-how licence is amortised over 5 years.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are written down to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates: Plant, machinery and equipment 20-25% Motor vehicles 25-33% Buildings 4% Plant, machinery and equipment of Space4 is depreciated based on its expected usage in terms of units produced.
Fixed asset investments The cost of shares purchased to satisfy awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan is capitalised as fixed asset investments, and subsequently charged to the profit and loss account over the relevant performance period.
The cost of shares purchased for awards under the Employee Share Incentive Plan is capitalised as a fixed asset investment and subsequently charged to the Profit and loss account over the vesting period.
Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised as though they had been purchased outright with the corresponding liability included as an obligation in finance lease creditors.
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account on such assets in accordance with the accounting policy above and the interest element of lease payments is charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Westbury plc Annual Report 2003 49 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2003 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Stocks Stocks, which comprise land held for development, work in progress and finished and second-hand houses, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes an appropriate proportion of direct overheads but excludes interest charges.
Government grants In respect of commercial development, grants received are treated as deferred income and are recognised in the profit and loss account once the development to which they relate has been sold.
Finance costs In accordance with FRS 4 the costs of raising term finance are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of such finance.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses straightforward derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate exposures.
Hedge accounting principles are applied to these instruments and the gains and losses are matched against the underlying interest charge.
The instruments are not recognised on the balance sheet at the year end.
The cost of early termination is spread over the maturity period of the underlying debt.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transaction or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Group operates two optional contributory pension schemes for selected employees.
The schemes are externally invested and the funds of the schemes are administered by trustees.
Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of three years, the rates of contributions payable being determined on the advice of the actuaries having regard to the results of these valuations.
In the intervening years the actuaries review whether the contribution rates continue to be appropriate.
In addition the Group provides a money purchase Group Personal Pension Plan for all employees.
Contributions are charged against profits so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group, and are included within staff costs.
Related parties The Group has provided the information required by FRS 8 in respect of transactions and balances with related parties.
This information is given in note 13 in respect of joint ventures, note 21 in respect of the pension scheme and in note 28 in respect of transactions relating to directors and senior managers.
The Group had no other transactions with related parties.

The contributions are determined by qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
Westbury Pension Scheme A formal valuation of the pension scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2000 by Watson Wyatt LLP.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The rate of investment return on existing assets of the scheme was assumed to be 6% pa and the rate on future contributions was assumed to be 6.5% pa. Additionally, it was assumed that salaries would increase at a rate of 4.0% pa, pensions earned before 5 April 1997 would increase at a rate of 3% pa and those earned after that date would increase at a rate of 2.5% pa.
The market value of the schemes investments at the effective date of the valuation was 31,447,000 and the results indicated that these assets represented 86% of the benefits which had accrued to members after allowing for future increases in earnings.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account has been calculated by Watson Wyatt LLP.
It is based on the actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2000 and, with the exception of future investment returns on the existing assets of the scheme, all assumptions are the same as those used for the actuarial valuation.
The rate of investment return on existing assets has been assumed to be 6.5% pa.
The resulting pension cost comprises a regular cost of 10.2% of Pensionable Earnings to meet the normal accrual of benefits, plus an annual amount of 434,000 indexed with national average earnings in future years to meet the deficiency over the average remaining service lives of the contributing members, less the interest on the prepayment.
Since the date of the last formal valuation of the scheme, UK stock markets have fallen by around 40% and the assets of the scheme have not been immune to this general trend.
The liabilities of the scheme are valued using a discount rate which reflects the market level at the date of the valuation.
The fall in the schemes assets does not, in itself, change the estimate of the cost of providing the pension benefits promised, which was based on the last formal valuation.
The cost will be reassessed following the next formal valuation, which will take place as at 5 April 2003.
The Group contributed to the scheme at the rate of 14% of Pensionable Earnings plus an additional amount to meet the minimum requirement under the Schedule of Contributions for the year to April 2002.
These rates of contribution have increased the prepayment to 3,870,000 at 28 February 2003 2002: 3,436,000.
During the year to 28 February 2003, the Group met administrative costs of 227,595 2002: 211,665 on behalf of the pension arrangements.
At 28 February 2003 there were no outstanding unpaid contributions in respect of the year to that date 2002: nil.
In addition, the Group provides a money purchase Group Personal Pension Plan.
The contributions to this arrangement plus payments in respect of death-in-service insurance premiums were 58,521 2002: 51,000.
Prowting Pension Scheme The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme for the purpose of calculating the employers pension costs was carried out as at 31 March 2000 by Mercers Human Resource Consulting Limited.
The Projected Unit method was used and the schemes assets were valued at market value.
The main assumptions used to determine the pension costs are rates of investment returns of 6% per annum for all members.
Further assumptions were Pensionable Salary increases of 5% per annum and pension increases of 3.25% per annum on pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions.

Pension commitments continued At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 20,834,000 and this represented 141% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The employers contributions into the scheme are 10.9% of pensionable salaries.
The pension cost for the financial year was 343,000.
FRS 17 disclosures The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements within FRS 17 Retirements Benefits have been calculated by independent actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2000 updated to 28 February 2003.
