The NV Directors arrangement operates on the basis of a justifiable expectation and does not provide any vested deferred entitlement.
NV Directors leaving before age 55 are only entitled to benets from other Unilever pension plans.
The accrued annual benets are calculated on the basis that benets commence at age 60: in the event the Director leaves service prior to age 60 and payment of the benefit commences earlier than age 60, the benets payable would be on a reduced basis.
Within last years report the NV Directors accrued annual benets were presented on the basis of an immediate but reduced pension.
This year the accrued annual benets for NV and PLC Directors are presented on the same basis, as described above, therefore for NV Directors the total accrued benets at 31 December 2002 were actuarially converted to be consistent with the form of the 31 December 2003 accrued annual benets.
2 The transfer values for the NV Directors arrangement are calculated on the basis used by the Unilever Netherlands pension plan Progress, in line with the Netherlands regulations.
The transfer values for the PLC Directors arrangement are calculated on the basis used by the Unilever United Kingdom pension plan UPF, in line with the GN11 guidance note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the United Kingdom.
3 During 2003 the UK based Directors paid compulsory contributions equivalent to 2% of their pensionable salary.
The Netherlands and US based Directors made no compulsory contributions in that year, in line with the then current practice for all employees in those countries.
4 Reached age 55 during the year, therefore the increase in total accrued benets during 2003 was calculated using the 31 December 2002 total accrued benets, actuarially converted to be consistent with the form of the 31 December 2003 accrued annual benefit.
