Carpetright plc Annual report and 34 accounts 2003 Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies a Accounting convention The Accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The transitional disclosures associated with the adoption of FRS17 have been applied.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The Group has produced consolidated accounts for the first time.
The comparatives are for the Company.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company made up to 3 May 2003 and those of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2003.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for acquisitions made during the period.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Intra group transactions are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Under section 230 4 of the companies act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
c Intangible fixed assets Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions during the period is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life not exceeding 20 years.
The goodwill arising on the European acquisition has been accounted for in Euros.
Amortisation is charged to the profit and loss account from the beginning of the month following acquisition.
d Turnover Turnover represents the value of goods sold to customers excluding value added tax.
e Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% p. a.
Short leasehold buildings Length of lease Fixtures and fittings 10% to 15% p. a.
Plant and machinery 10% to 15% p. a.
Motor vehicles 25% p. a. Freehold land is not depreciated.
f Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
g Deferred taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
h Leased assets Assets financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership are held under finance leases and included in tangible fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period of the lease.
Rentals are apportioned between reductions in the capital obligations included in creditors and those amounts relating to finance charges, which are charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge.
All operating lease rentals are written off to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Income under operating leases is credited to the profit and loss on a receivable basis.
i Pensions The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The cost of providing pension benefits is spread over the expected working lives of pension scheme members.
Certain companies within the Group also operate defined contribution schemes, contributions to which are charged against profits as they become payable.
j Employee share schemes The cost of administration of the All Employee Share Ownership Plan is borne by the Company.
k Accounting for new stores Benefits received as incentives to sign leases, in the form of reverse premiums and post-opening rent free periods, are spread on a straight line basis over the period to the first rent review.
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Carpetright plc Annual report and 35 accounts 2003 l Foreign currency The profit and loss account and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and the balance sheet at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets are dealt with through reserves.
In addition, exchange differences between the results translated at an average rate and a closing rate are dealt with through reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in foreign enterprises are taken to reserves and disclosed in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, together with any tax charges or credits arising on the retranslation.
m Cash and liquid resources Cash for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.

It also purchased 100% of two property companies owning freehold property rented by Carpetland NV and its subsidiary Carpetland BV as well as other tenants.
On 31 October the remaining 50% of the shares were acquired.
The results of these companies have been consolidated for the period from 1 July 2002 to 3 May 2003 in line with the basis in Note 1.
The total purchase cost of 34.2 million including fees gives rise to goodwill on acquisition of 16.1 million after accounting for the fair value of the assets acquired and minority interest of 1.4 million.
A breakdown of the fair value of the assets acquired is as follows: Accounting Book value Revaluation policy alignment Fair value 000 000 000 000 Net assets acquired Tangible fixed assets 21,996 8,327 669 29,654 Stocks 10,162 95 576 9,491 Debtors 2,754 2,754 Cash at bank and in hand 86 86 Total assets 34,998 8,232 1,245 41,985 Creditors 10,481 68 10,413 Bank overdrafts 3,581 3,581 Loans and finance leases 6,808 6,808 Deferred taxation 2,838 1,095 1,743 Liabilities 23,708 68 1,095 22,545 Net assets acquired 11,290 8,300 150 19,440 Minority interest 1,360 Goodwill 16,147 Purchase consideration and costs of acquisition 34,227 The Group has accounted for goodwill in Euros and the summary above is converted to Sterling at the rate prevailing at the date of acquisition.
The purchase consideration was paid in full in Euros on 31 October 2002.
The principal fair value adjustments have arisen as follows: Fixed assets: Freehold and long leasehold properties were revalued to market value at the date of acquisition, which is partially offset by the write-down of assets in certain stores.
The accounting policy alignment is to bring depreciation rates in line with the UK accounting policies.
Other: The value of discontinued stock lines was written down to nil, and the recognition of deferred tax was brought in line with UK accounting policy.

a Currency exposure Net monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in Sterling are as follows: 2003 2002 '000 '000 Euro assets bank account 2,852 476 Euro liabilities bank loan 42,334 The Group has two significant overseas subsidiaries which operate in Europe and whose revenues and expenses are denominated exclusively in Euros.
In order to protect the Group's sterling balance sheet from the movements in the Euro sterling exchange rate, the Group finances its net investment in this subsidiary by means of Euro borrowings.
b Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Borrowings are denominated in Euros and are subject to floating rates of interest as detailed in Notes 15 and 16. c Liquidity risk 82.4% of the Group's term borrowings are due to mature between two and five years and 17.6% in more than five years.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities.
d Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are the same as book values.
23 Contingent liabilities The Group and the Company had no contingent liabilities requiring disclosure at the year end 2002: nil.
24 Pensions costs The UK Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company, being invested in a Managed Fund operated by the Clerical Medical Investment Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2002 when the market value of the fund was 4,270,384 excluding the value of any Additional Voluntary Contributions and at which date the actuarial value of the assets represented 88% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are a rate of investment return of 6.5% and salary increases of 4% p. a.
The contributions of the Company and employees were 16% and 5% of earnings respectively.
Contributions totalling 62,750 2002: 38,221 are included in creditors and have been paid to the fund since the year end.
