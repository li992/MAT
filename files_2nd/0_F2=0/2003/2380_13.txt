In preparing those accounts, the directors are required: To select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
To make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
To state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts.
To prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements, and having a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

51 Notes on accounts 11 T axation continued Factors that may affect future tax charges The group earns income in many different countries and, on average, pays taxes at rates higher than the UK statutory rate.
The overall impact of these higher taxes, which include the supplementary charge of 10% on UK North Sea profits, is subject to changes in enacted tax rates and the country mix of the groups income.
However, it is not expected to increase or decrease substantially in the near term.
The tax charge in 2002 reflected a benefit from US non-conventional fuel credits which are no longer available after 31 December 2002.
The effect of the loss of these credits on the overall tax charge was offset in 2003 by benefits from restructuring and planning initiatives.
The group has around $4.5 billion $5.3 billion of carry-forward tax losses in the UK, which would be available to offset against future taxable income.
To date, tax assets have been recognized on $285 million $840 million of those losses i. e. to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that suitable taxable income will arise.
During 2003 the group disclaimed tax depreciation allowances, which will be available in future periods, in order to optimize the utilization of tax losses.
This is reflected in the movement in tax losses carried forward between the end of 2002 and 2003.
Carry-forward losses in other taxing jurisdictions have not been recognized as deferred tax assets, and are unlikely to have a significant effect on the groups tax rate in future years.
The groups profit before taxation includes stock holding gains or losses.
These gains or losses are not taxed or deductible in certain jurisdictions in which the group operates, and therefore give rise to decreases or increases in the effective tax rate.
However, over the longer term, significant changes in the tax rate would arise only in the event of a substantial and sustained change in oil prices.
The impact on the tax rate of acquisition amortization non-deductible depreciation and amortization relating to the fixed asset revaluation adjustments and goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and Burmah Castrol acquisitions is unlikely to change in the near term.
The major component of timing differences in the current year is accelerated tax depreciation.
Based on current capital investment plans, the group expects to continue to be able to claim tax allowances in excess of depreciation in future years at a level similar to the current year.

The profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is $10,265 million $6,843 million.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, adjusted for the unwinding of the discount on the deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP, of $10,289 million $6,843 million.
The number of shares outstanding is adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee share options are converted into ordinary shares, and for the ordinary shares issuable, in three annual tranches, in respect of the TNK-BP joint venture.
The number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share may be reconciled as follows: shares thousand 2003 2002 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 22,170,741 22,397,126 Potential dilutive effect of ordinary shares issuable under employee share schemes 71,651 107,322 Potential dilutive effect of ordinary shares issuable as consideration for BPs interest in the TNK-BP joint venture 186,980 22,429,372 22,504,448 In addition to basic earnings per share based on the historical cost profit for the year, a further measure, based on replacement cost profit before exceptional items, is provided as it is considered that this measure gives an indication of underlying performance.

All these business combinations were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
No significant fair value adjustments were made to the acquired assets and liabilities.
Goodwill of $5 million arose on these acquisitions.
In addition the group redeemed the outstanding stock in CH-Twenty, Inc. a subsidiary undertaking, for $150 million.
On 29 August BP and the Alfa Group and Access-Renova AAR combined their Russian and Ukranian oil and gas businesses to create TNK-BP, a new company owned and managed 50:50 by BP and AAR.
TNK-BP is a joint venture and accounted for under the gross equity method.
BP contributed its 29% interest in Sidanco, its 29% interest in Rusia Petroleum and its holding in the BP Moscow retail network.
In addition BP paid AAR $2,306 million in cash and will subsequently pay three annual tranches of $1,250 million in BP ordinary shares, valued at market prices prior to each annual payment.
Costs of the transaction amounted to $45 million.
In exceptional and unanticipated circumstances BP may be required to settle these annual tranches in cash rather than shares.
Acquisitions in 2002 During the year BP acquired the whole of Veba Oil Veba from E. ON in two stages.
Veba owns Aral, Germanys biggest fuels retailer.
In February BP paid $1,072 million to subscribe for new shares issued by Veba and acquired $1,520 million of outstanding loans from E. ON to Veba in return for a 51% interest in and operational control of Veba.
In addition, there were acquisition expenses of $30 million.
Subsequently, on 30 June BP paid E. ON a further $2,386 million to acquire the remaining 49% of Veba.
There were further acquisition expenses of $30 million.
The total consideration of $5,038 million was subject to final closing adjustments.
Other transactions in 2002 included buying our co-venturers 15% interest in the ARCO polypropylene joint venture and acquiring the 51% BP did not own in certain Chinese LPG ventures.
All these business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The assets and liabilities acquired as part of the 2002 acquisitions are shown in aggregate in the table below.
The identifiable assets and liabilities of Veba were not revalued on the acquisition of the 49% minority interest in June, as the difference between the fair values and the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities was not material.
Additional goodwill of $203 million was originally recognized on the acquisition of the minority interest in Veba.
This has been reduced to $61 million following the revisions to the fair values described below.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities of Veba included in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2002 have been subject to further investigation and review during 2003, as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No.

Financial instruments comprise primary financial instruments cash, fixed and current asset investments, debtors, creditors, finance debt and provisions and derivative financial instruments interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, oil price contracts, natural gas price contracts and power price contracts.
Interest rate contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Foreign exchange contracts include forwards, futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil, natural gas and power price contracts are those that require settlement in cash and include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil, natural gas and power price contracts that require physical delivery are not financial instruments.
However, if it is normal market practice for a particular type of oil, natural gas and power contract, despite having contract terms that require settlement by delivery, to be extinguished other than by physical delivery e. g. by cash payment it is called a cash-settled commodity contract.
Contracts of this type are included with derivatives in the disclosures in Notes 25 and 26.
With the exception of the table of currency exposures shown on page 61, short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the groups operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note, as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No.

The proportion of floating rate debt at 31 December 2003 was 97% of total finance debt outstanding.
Aside from debt issued in the US municipal bond markets, interest rates on floating rate debt denominated in US dollars are linked principally to London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR, while rates on debt in other currencies are based on local market equivalents.
The group monitors interest rate risk using a process of sensitivity analysis.
Assuming no changes to the finance debt and hedges described above, it is estimated that a change of 1% in the general level of interest rates on 1 January 2004 would change 2004 profit before tax by approximately $210 million.

Fixed asset investments included in the table above are held for the long term and have no maturity period.
They are excluded from the calculation of weighted average time until maturity.
25 Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business the group is a party to derivative financial instruments derivatives with off balance sheet risk, primarily to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The group also manages certain of its exposures to movements in oil, natural gas and power prices.
In addition, the group trades derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.
Risk management Gains and losses on derivatives used for risk management purposes are deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments to carrying amounts, as appropriate, when the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs.
When an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur or finance debt is terminated before maturity, any deferred gain or loss that has arisen on the related derivative is recognized in the income statement, together with any gain or loss on the terminated item.
Where such derivatives used for hedging purposes are terminated before the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognized on a basis that matches the timing and accounting treatment of the underlying hedged item.
The unrecognized and carried-forward gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging, and the movements therein, are shown in the following table.
$ million Unrecognized Carried forward in the balance sheet Gains Losses Total Gains Losses Total Gains and losses at 1 January 2003 526 450 76 352 28 324 of which accounted for in income in 2003 96 51 45 200 14 186 Gains and losses at 31 December 2003 331 130 201 1,003 425 578 of which expected to be recognized in income in 2004 98 28 70 438 75 363 Gains and losses at 1 January 2002 109 235 126 113 327 214 of which accounted for in income in 2002 60 19 41 50 162 112 Gains and losses at 31 December 2002 526 450 76 352 28 324 of which expected to be recognized in income in 2003 96 51 45 200 14 186 Trading activities The group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives.
This activity is undertaken in conjunction with risk management activities.
Derivatives held for trading purposes are marked-to-market and any gain or loss recognized in the income statement.
For traded derivatives, many positions have been neutralized, with trading initiatives being concluded by taking opposite positions to fix a gain or loss, thereby achieving a zero net market risk.
The following table shows the fair value at 31 December of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
The fair values at the year end are not materially unrepresentative of the position throughout the year.

These techniques are based on a variance covariance model or a Monte Carlo simulation and make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period.
The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures, and the history of one-day price movements over the previous 12 months, together with the correlation of these price movements.
The potential movement in fair values is expressed to three standard deviations which is equivalent to a 99.7% confidence level.
This means that, in broad terms, one would expect to see an increase or a decrease in fair values greater than the value at risk on only one occasion per year if the portfolio were left unchanged.
The group calculates value at risk on all instruments that are held for trading purposes and that therefore give an exposure to market risk.
The value-at-risk model takes account of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate forward and futures contracts, swap agreements, options and swaptions: foreign exchange forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options: and oil, natural gas and power price futures, swap agreements and options.
Financial assets and liabilities and physical crude oil and refined products that are treated as trading positions are also included in these calculations.
The value-at-risk calculation for oil, natural gas and power price exposure also includes cash-settled commodity contracts such as forward contracts.
The following table shows values at risk for trading activities.

It is considered that a more comprehensive representation of the groups oil, natural gas and power price trading activities is given by aggregating the gain or loss on such derivatives together with the gain or loss arising from the physical and paper trades to which they relate, representing the net result of the trading portfolio.

The table also shows the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
This amount represents the net book value, i. e. market value when acquired or later marked-to-market.
Foreign exchange contracts include forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil, natural gas and power price contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options and cash-settled commodity contracts such as forward contracts.
Short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the groups operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note, as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No.

The fair value of listed fixed asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.
Current assets Debtors falling due after more than one year The fair value of other debtors due after one year is estimated not to be materially different from its carrying value.
Current assets Investments and cash at bank and in hand The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for unlisted current asset investments and cash at bank and in hand approximates their fair value.
The fair value of listed current asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.
Finance debt The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, which mainly comprise commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses, based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.
Creditors Amounts falling due after more than one year Other creditors Deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP is discounted to the present value of the future payments.
The carrying value thus approximates the fair value.
The remaining liabilities are predominantly interest-free.
In view of their short maturities, the reported carrying amount is estimated to approximate the fair value.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Other provisions Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years the amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
The carrying amount of provisions thus approximates the fair value.
Derivative financial instruments and cash-settled commodity contracts The fair values of the groups interest rate and foreign exchange contracts are based on pricing models that take into account relevant market data.
The fair values of the groups oil, natural gas and power price contracts futures contracts, swap agreements, options and forward contracts are based on market prices.

Total finance debt includes an asset of $745 million $277 million for the carrying value of currency swaps and forward contracts.
Included within Other loans repayable within one year are US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds of $2,503 million $1,881 million with maturity periods ranging up to 35 years.
They are classified as repayable within one year, as required under UK GAAP, as the bondholders typically have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates.
Any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not experienced any significant repurchases.
BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when assessing the maturity profile of its finance debt.
At 31 December 2003, the groups share of third party finance debt of joint ventures and associated undertakings was $2,151 million $457 million and $922 million $849 million respectively.
These amounts are not reflected in the groups debt on the balance sheet.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt is 2%.

At 31 December 2003, the provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives was $4,720 million $4,168 million.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.5% 2.5%.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount reasonably determinable.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities at 31 December 2003 was $2,298 million $2,122 million.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of liability.
The group also holds provisions for potential future awards under the long-term performance plans, expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties and sundry other liabilities.
To the extent that these liabilities are not expected to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using a real discount rate of 2.5% 2.5%.

BP offers most of its employees the opportunity to acquire a shareholding in the company through savings-related and or matching share plan arrangements.
Such arrangements are now in place in nearly 80 countries.
BP also uses long-term performance plans see Note 35 and the granting of share options as elements of remuneration for executive directors and senior employees.
During 2003, share options were granted to the executive directors under the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP.
For these options the option exercise price was the market value as determined in accordance with the plan rules on the grant date.
The options granted to executive directors reflect BPs performance in terms of total shareholder return, that is, share price increase with all dividends reinvested, relative to the FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three years preceding the grant as well as the underlying health of the business and the competitive marketplace.
Options are not granted in any year unless the criteria for an award of shares under the share element of the EDIP see Note 35 have been met.
Options vest over three years one-third each after one, two and three years respectively and have a life of seven years after the grant.
Share options were also granted in 2003 under the BP Share Option Plan to certain categories of employees.
Subject to certain vesting requirements the options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
There are no performance conditions attaching to the options granted during the year.
Under the BP ShareSave Plan a savings-related share option plan employees save on a monthly basis over a threeor five-year period towards the purchase of shares at a price fixed when the option is granted.
The option price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract: otherwise it lapses.
The plan is run in the UK and a small number of other countries.
Under the BP ShareMatch Plan, BP matches employees own contributions of shares, up to a predetermined limit.
The shares are then held in trust for a defined minimum period.
The plan is run in the UK and in over 70 other countries.
BP does not recognize an expense in respect of share options granted to employees.
If the fair value of options granted in any particular year is estimated and this value amortized over the vesting period of the options, an indication of the cost of granting options to employees can be made.
The fair value of each share option granted has been estimated using a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2003 2002 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 4.0% Expected volatility 30% 26% Expected life in years 1 to 5 1 to 5 Expected dividend yield 4.00% 3.75% Weighted average fair value of options granted $ 1.44 1.64 The additional expense that would have been recognized in 2003 on this basis would be $79 million $90 million and the impact on earnings per share would be 1 cent 1 cent.
The company sponsors a number of savings plans covering most US employees.
Under these plans, most employees may contribute up to 100% of their salary subject to certain regulatory limits.
Most employees are eligible for a dollar-for-dollar company-matched contribution for the first 7% of eligible pay contributed on a before-tax or after-tax basis, or a combination of both.
The precise arrangement may vary in certain business units.
Company contributions are initially invested in a fund primarily comprised of BP ADSs but employees may transfer those amounts and may invest their own contributions in more than 200 investment options.
The companys contributions generally vest over a period of three years.
Company contributions to savings plans during the year were $130 million $125 million.
An Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP was established in 1997 to acquire BP shares to satisfy future requirements of certain employee share plans.
The company provides funding to the ESOP.
The assets and liabilities of the ESOP are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company within the accounts.
The ESOP has waived its rights to dividends.
During 2003, the ESOP released 16,892,853 shares 15,332,235 shares for the matching share plans.
The cost of shares released for these plans has been charged in these accounts.

35 Long-term performance plans During 2003, the company operated two long-term performance plans: the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP for executive directors and the Long Term Performance Plan LTPP for senior employees.
Executive directors participated in the LTPP prior to 2002 or to their appointment as an executive director, whichever was the later.
Both plans are incentive schemes under which the company may award shares to participants or fund the purchase of shares for participants if long-term targets are met.
Awards were made in 2003 in respect of the 2000-2002 LTPP.
Further details of the plans are given in the directors remuneration report on pages 106-115.
The costs of potential future awards for both the EDIP and LTPP are accrued over the three-year performance periods of each plan.
The amount charged in 2003 was $94 million $51 million.
The value of awards under the 2000-2002 LTPP made in 2003 was $35 million 1999-2001 LTPP $125 million.
Employees are able to defer the date of their potential award beyond the end of the performance period.
The amount charged in respect of the increase in deferred awards after the expiry of the relevant performance periods was $17 million $19 million.
Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the EDIP and LTPP and then to hold them for the participants during the retention period of the plan.
In order to hedge the cost of potential future awards and deferred awards the ESOPs may, from time to time over the performance period of the plans, purchase BP shares in the open market.
The company provides funding to the ESOPs.
The assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company within these accounts.
The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards.
At 31 December 2003, the ESOPs held 4,118,835 shares 3,901,317 shares for potential future awards.

Pension contributions Six executive directors participated in a non-contributory pension scheme established for UK staff by a separate trust fund to which contributions are made by BP based on actuarial advice.
One US executive director participated in the US BP Retirement Accumulation Plan during 2003.
Office facilities for former chairmen and deputy chairmen It is customary for the company to make available to former chairmen and deputy chairmen, who were previously employed executives, the use of office and basic secretarial facilities following their retirement.
The cost involved in doing so is not significant.
Further information Full details of individual directors remuneration are given in the directors remuneration report on pages 106-115.
38 Loans to officers During the year Miss J C Hanratty repaid a low interest loan of $43,000 made to her prior to her appointment as company secretary on 1 October 1994.
71 Notes on accounts 39 Pensions Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary schemes.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
Contributions to funded defined benefit plans are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
The cumulative difference, since the adoption of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24, between the contributions paid by BP to the pension funds and the pension expense recorded each year is reflected in the balance sheet.
If the cumulative contributions exceed pension expense the difference is shown as a prepayment on the balance sheet.
If the cumulative contributions are less than pension expense the difference is shown as a provision on the balance sheet.
For unfunded plans, where assets are not held with the specific purpose of matching pension obligations, the accrued liability for pension benefits is included within other provisions.
The majority of the groups employees are members of defined benefit plans.
The pension plans in the UK and US are reviewed annually by the independent actuaries and subject to a formal actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The date of the latest actuarial valuation for the UK and US plans was 1 January 2003.
The date of the most recent actuarial reviews was 31 December 2003.
During 2003 contributions of $258 million and $2,189 million were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition contributions of $86 million were made to other funded defined benefit plans.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2004 is expected to be approximately $400 million.
The pension assumptions for the principal plans are set out below.
The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December in any year are used to determine pension expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2003 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension cost for 2004.
This applies for both accounting bases described in this note.
Pension costs for the UK and US plans have been derived using the projected unit method and by amortizing surpluses and deficits on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service lives of the current employees.
An analysis of pension expense is set out below.

However, there is a new accounting standard, Financial Reporting Standard No.
17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17, which changes the basis of accounting for pensions and other post-retirement benefits and requires certain disclosures in the periods prior to adoption.
The additional disclosures for the year ended 31 December 2003 and earlier periods are shown in the following tables.
The group has adopted FRS 17 with effect from 1 January 2004.

provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to their retired employees and dependants.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The plans are funded to a limited extent and the accrued net liability for post-retirement benefits is included within other provisions.
The cost of providing post-retirement benefits is assessed annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The date of the latest actuarial valuation was 1January 2003 and the date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2003.
The assumptions used in calculating the charge for post-retirement benefits are consistent with those shown in Note 39 for US pension plans.
The charge to income for post-retirement benefits is as follows: $ million 2003 2002 Service cost 54 37 Interest on post-retirement benefit liabilities 259 219 Expected return on plan assets 2 4 Amortization of variances 77 21 Curtailment 11 3 377 276 At 31 December 2003, the independent actuaries reassessed the obligation for post-retirement benefits at $4,143 million $4,326 million.
The discount rate used to assess the obligation at 31 December 2003 of the plans was 6.0% 6.75%.

The groups obligation for other postretirement benefits at 31 December 2003 does not reflect the effects of the recent Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 Act.
The provisions of the Act provide for a federal subsidy for plans that provide prescription drug benefits and meet certain qualifications, and alternatively would allow prescription drug plan sponsors to co-ordinate with the Medicare benefit.
Specific authoritative accounting guidance is pending and when that guidance is issued, it could require BP to change its actuarially determined obligation for post-retirement benefits and net cost for postretirement benefits in subsequent periods.

78 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2003 42 Contingent liabilities There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2003 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the groups business.
No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities.
Approximately 200 lawsuits were filed in State and Federal Courts in Alaska seeking compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in March 1989.
Most of those suits named Exxon now ExxonMobil, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company Alyeska, which operates the oil terminal at Valdez, and the other oil companies which own Alyeska.
Alyeska initially responded to the spill until the response was taken over by Exxon.
BP owns a 47% interest reduced during 2001 from 50% by a sale of 3% to Phillips in Alyeska through a subsidiary of BP America Inc. and briefly indirectly owned a further 20% interest in Alyeska following BPs combination with Atlantic Richfield Company Atlantic Richfield.
Alyeska and its owners have settled all the claims against them under these lawsuits.
Exxon has indicated that it may file a claim for contribution against Alyeska for a portion of the costs and damages which it has incurred.
If any claims are asserted by Exxon which affect Alyeska and its owners, BP will defend the claims vigorously.
Since 1987, Atlantic Richfield, a current subsidiary of BP, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging injury to persons and property caused by lead pigment in paint.
The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed as against Atlantic Richfield.
Atlantic Richfield and in one case two of its affiliates is named in these lawsuits as alleged successor to International Smelting & Refining which, along with a predecessor company, manufactured lead pigment during the period 1920-1946.
Plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities.
Several of the lawsuits purport to be class actions.
The lawsuits depending on plaintiff seek various remedies including: compensation to lead-poisoned children: cost to find and remove lead paint from buildings: medical monitoring and screening programmes: public warning and education on lead hazards: reimbursement of government healthcare costs and special education for lead-poisoned citizens: and punitive damages.
No case has been settled or tried to conclusion.
While the amounts claimed could be substantial and it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, Atlantic Richfield believes that it has valid defences and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.
Consequently, BP believes that the impact of these lawsuits on the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity will not be material.
The group is subject to numerous national and local environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities.
These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties.
Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites.
In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities.
The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate.
However, the estimated cost of known environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
While the amounts of future costs could be significant and could be material to the groups results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, BP does not expect these costs to have a material effect on the groups financial position or liquidity.
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations where this is required for legal or contractual reasons.
This is because external insurance is not considered an economic means of financing losses for the group.
Losses will therefore be borne as they arise rather than being spread over time through insurance premia with attendant transaction costs.
The position is reviewed periodically.
The parent company has issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2003 were $20,903 million $19,952 million, including $20,847 million $19,896 million in respect of borrowings by its subsidiary undertakings and $56 million $56 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
In addition, other group companies have issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2003 were $635 million $338 million in respect of borrowings of joint ventures and associated undertakings and $304 million $237 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
43 Capital commitments Authorized future capital expenditure by group companies for which contracts had been placed at 31 December 2003 amounted to $6,420 million $5,966 million.
79 Notes on accounts 44 Subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures The more important subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures of the group at 31 December 2003 and the group percentage of ordinary share capital or joint venture interest to nearest whole number are set out below.
