4 FA C T ORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE TAX CHARGES The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets amounting to 8.9m 2002 18.2m arising from timing diff e rences and losses b rought forw a rd in the US as it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be re c o v e red in the short term.
Other than the potential availability of these unprovided tax losses and other timing diff e rences, there are no factors that are expected to significantly a ffect the taxation charges for future years.

Employee costs including directors comprise: Wages and salaries 1 1 4.
EMPLOYEES continued The Group operates throughout the UK a defined benefit final salary pension scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate t rustee administered fund.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method in a review of the scheme as at 1st December 2001.
The actuarial assumptions are that the investment re t u rn will be 1.9% per annum above annual salary growth.
The market value of the assets of the scheme on 1st December 2001 was 75.9m.
Their actuarial value re p resented 72% of the value of benefits for service to the date of the review allowing for future salary incre a s e s. In deriving a pension cost, the shortfall in the Scheme is being spread as fixed amounts over the future working lifetime of the existing members.
For the purpose of funding the Scheme, the shortfall is spread over a shorter period as a level percentage of members salaries.
As a result of the actuarial valuation at 1st December, 2001 employer contributions to the Scheme increased with effect from 1st D e c e m b e r, 2002.
Normal annual contributions increased from 3.9m per annum to 6.6m per annum.
In this re g a rd, with eff e c t f rom 1st December, 2002, the Companys UK employer contribution was increased to 15.2% of pensionable salary.
The Group has also agreed to strengthen the Schemes funding by additional contributions of 2.1m per annum for 10 years, starting in 2003.
The actual additional contribution made in each year will be reviewed annually in the light of actuarial advice.
Furt h e rm o re during 2003 the employer contribution rate will be increased to 18.2%.
Since the end of the financial year a review of the investment strategy for the Scheme has also been completed.
In order to contro l risk the target asset allocation for the Scheme has been amended and now comprises 60% equities and 40% bonds and gilts.
The defined benefit final salary section of the pension scheme closed to new members on 1st July 2001 and was replaced by a defined contribution section of the Scheme for new employees.
Under the projected unit method of valuation the current serv i c e cost will increase as members approach re t i re m e n t. The total UK employer contribution in respect of both Schemes for the year ended 30th June 2003 amounted to 5.3m 2002 4.0m, while the amount charged to the profit and loss account was 8.0m 2002 4.2m.
This increased the balance sheet a c c rual of 3.3m at the year ended 30th June 2002 to 6.0m at 30th June 2003.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per ord i n a ry share is based on the profit after taxation of 206,400,000 2002 158,100,000 and the weighted average number of ord i n a ry shares in issue and ranking for dividend during the year excluding those held by the Barr a t t Developments Employee Benefit Trust of 231,641,125 2002 230,518,421.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue and ranking for dividend is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The eff e c t of the dilutive potential shares is 2,253,881 2002 3,008,294, this gives a diluted weighted average number of shares of 4 2 233,895,006 2002 233,526,715.
