BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 Notes to the accounts 1 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS EARLY ADOPTION OF UITF ABSTRACT 38, 'ACCOUNTING FOR ESOP TRUSTS' BG Group has adopted UITF 38 in its 2003 Financial Statements and consequently has transferred amounts representing consideration paid for shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trusts from debtors to shareholders' funds.
Amounts recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of share awards, previously recorded at book value of shares held in the ESOP trusts, are now based on the fair value of shares at the date the award is made.
These changes have not been applied retrospectively as the impact is immaterial.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 16 February 2004, BG Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire El Paso Oil and Gas Canada, Inc.
The acquired company holds producing gas fields, together with around 630 000 acres of undeveloped oil and gas acreage.
The transaction is expected to complete in March 2004 for a cash consideration of US$346m, based on an economic effective date of 1 January 2004.
On 19 February 2004, BG Group announced that it had signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of Mauritania Holdings B. V. which owns interests in Production Sharing Contracts offshore Mauritania, West Africa.
The transaction is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2004 for a cash consideration of $132m, plus up to a further $5.1m that is contingent upon the attainment of certain exploration and production milestones.
2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The reporting segments for BG Groups operations in 2003 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG, Transmission and Distribution T&D, Power Generation Power and Other activities.
E&P comprises exploration, development, production and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on gas.

Power develops, owns and operates natural gas-fired power generation plants around the world.
Other activities primarily comprises New Business development expenditure and certain corporate costs.
In 2001, BG Groups operations also included the Storage segment.
Storage provided a range of gas storage services based on underground and offshore storage facilities to meet the requirements of customers in Great Britain.
BG Group sold its Storage interests on 28 November 2001.
During 2003, the disclosure of segmental information on a geographical basis was reviewed following changes to BG Groups internal management structure.
As a result of this review, the following geographical segments were identified for disclosure: North West Europe, South America, Asia and Middle East, North America and Trinidad, and Mediterranean Basin and Africa.
Comparative results have been restated to reflect this presentation, which complies with the segmental reporting requirements of both UK and US generally accepted 79 accounting principles.

The effective interest rates of the loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings as at 31 December 2003 were between 0% and 9.95% 2002 4.06% and 9.95%.
The maturity profile of the non-interest bearing financial assets, being primarily loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings, cannot be practicably estimated as repayments are based on the performance of the individual joint venture or associated undertaking.
The interest rates on those Group financial assets and liabilities which are at floating rates are determined mainly by the prevailing London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR for the relevant currency and maturity at the time of determination plus or minus an agreed margin.

The amounts actually exchanged are based upon all the terms of the derivatives, including interest rates, exchange rates and notional amounts.
The value of the derivatives is based upon these underlying parameters and changes in the relevant rates or prices.

The fair value of the fixed rate long-term borrowings and joint venture and associated undertaking loans has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices.
The fair value of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associated undertaking loans approximates book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings as repayment of these loans is linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associated undertaking and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.
The amount for cash-settled commodity contracts represents the Groups estimated liability based on forward price curves for a number of gas and oil contracts.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures in the table above.

The impact of this surcharge included a 51m charge relating to the opening UK deferred tax balances in 2002 see note 8, page 88.
A brief description of each provision together with estimates of the timing of expenditure is given below: DECOMMISSIONING COSTS The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the producing lives of fields is reviewed periodically and is based on engineering estimates and reports, including those from independent experts.
Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date.
The payment dates of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain but are currently anticipated to be between 2004 and 2030.
At the year end, the discount rate used for calculating the decommissioning provision was reviewed and revised downwards to reflect the sustained trend in interest rates.
The provision as at 31 December 2003 has been calculated assuming a nominal discount rate of 5% and both the decommissioning provision and associated asset have been increased by 52m to reflect this change.
PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT COSTS Pension costs represent the difference between the charge or credit to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and the 99 contributions to the pension schemes see Principal Accounting Policies, page 70 and note 27, page 103.
Post-retirement costs relate to a healthcare plan in respect of Comgas.
DEFERRED PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX The provision for tax on gas and oil activities is calculated on a unit of production basis and represents liabilities expected to crystallise on certain North Sea fields.
The first payment is expected to be made in 2005.
The calculation is based upon estimated remaining production of 98 mmboe.
DEFERRED CORPORATION TAX This represents the provision for the tax attributable to timing differences between profits and losses compiled for tax purposes and results as stated in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is provided for in full on certain timing differences.
The provision has been calculated as follows: THE GROUP 2003 2002 m m UK corporation tax at 30% and 40% 2002 30% and 40% : Accelerated capital allowances 710 735 Other timing differences 205 196 505 539 Overseas tax 183 82 688 621 BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 22 PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED In the event of the distribution of the unappropriated profits or reserves of certain overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings, additional liabilities to UK and overseas tax of approximately 231m 2002 200m might arise.
Such potential deferred tax liabilities have not been provided because it is currently not intended to remit the profits.
OTHER The balance as at 31 December 2003 primarily represents restructuring costs arising from the renegotiation of power purchase agreements at Premier Power Limited of 17m 2002 26m.

Exchange gains losses of 115m 2002 198m: 2001 2 m on foreign currency net borrowings have been offset in reserves against exchange adjustments on the net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 24 CAPITAL AND RESERVES CONTINUED In addition to the above exchange gain on borrowings in 2003, two of BG Groups subsidiary undertakings, Gas Argentino S. A. and MetroGAS S. A. have recognised losses of 38m in their company profit and loss accounts resulting from the retranslation of their US Dollar borrowings to Argentine Peso on the devaluation of the latter currency.
This devaluation had no impact on the consolidated borrowings of BG Group and consequently the loss recognised in the local subsidiary undertakings books has been moved at a consolidated accounts level to match the associated profit which arose in consolidated reserves on retranslation, from Peso to Sterling.
As at 31 December 2003, cumulative goodwill amounting to 232m 2002 232m: 2001 232m has been eliminated against BG Groups profit and loss account reserve in accordance with the accounting policy prior to the implementation of FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in 1998.
This goodwill will be charged to the profit and loss account on any subsequent disposal of the businesses to which it relates.
No goodwill was transferred from reserves and charged against the profit and loss account for either 2003, 2002 or 2001.
The profit loss for the financial year, dealt with in the accounts of the Company, was 197m 2002 3 m: 2001 404m.

F LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BG International Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of BG Group, is one of seven companies collectively known as the Contractor holding interests under a Production Sharing Agreement the PSA with the Republic of Kazakhstan RoK with rights to drill in a sector of the north-east Caspian Sea.
BG International Limited currently has a one-sixth interest in the PSA.
In June 2002, the Kashagan discovery was declared commercial.
In December 2002, the Development Plan and Budget DP&B for the Kashagan Development was submitted to the RoK.
The RoK subsequently wrote to the Contractor alleging that the DP&B was non-compliant with the PSA and that this constituted a material breach of the PSA, which would entitle the RoK to terminate the PSA.
The Contractor has rejected these allegations.
In the event of any proceedings arising from these disputes, the Contractor intends to contest vigorously these allegations.
However, the PSA contains provisions for amicable settlement of disputes and discussions have taken place.
This issue was resolved by a Supplemental Agreement SA signed, and approved by RoK Decree, on 25 February 2004.
The sums payable under the SA are for the account of the five buyers of BG Groups interest under the pre-emption Sale and Purchase Agreements SPAs.
Final sign-offs from the RoK, on the closing documents pursuant to the SPAs, are expected in early 2004.
First Gas Power Corporation FGPC, in which the Group has a 40% shareholding, is in dispute with Siemens AG, Siemens Power Generation and Siemens Inc. collectively Siemens relating to Siemens construction for FGPC of the Santa Rita power station in prior years.
The dispute arises from delays in project completion.
FGPC is claiming liquidated damages of approximately 62m owing from Siemens to FGPC and has withheld approximately 59m from its milestone payments to Siemens.
Siemens is claiming that FGPC is not entitled to any remedy including liquidated damages for the delay in completion of the project and is seeking payment of the amounts withheld by FGPC and additional unspecified amounts for costs, loss of profit and finance charges arising from the delay.
Siemens made a formal request for arbitration in January 2003.
FGPC submitted its answer in June 2003.
A hearing of legal matters is scheduled for March 2004 with the final hearing scheduled for April 2005.
FGPC plans to contest vigorously all Siemens claims, including those claims that seek recovery of amounts withheld by FGPC as liquidated damages.
FGPC plans to seek the additional 3m approximately owed by Siemens in liquidated damages as well as additional amounts in counterclaims against Siemens.
In addition, various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome 102 of some of these matters cannot readily be foreseen, it is considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as shown in these Financial Statements.
Further detail in respect of litigation can be found in the Operating and Financial Review, page 47.

27 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme is of the defined benefit type.
It is exempt approved and established under Trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The Scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the Schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the Scheme.
Employees contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 3% of pensionable pay.
Participating employers contributions, including Scheme expenses, are certified by the Scheme actuary.
For the year ended 31 December 2003, the employers contribution rate was 19.9% of pensionable pay.
Higher paid employees may be subject to the earnings cap which is a restriction on the amount of pay which can be used to calculate pensions from a tax approved pension scheme.
The Company has agreed that on becoming capped, employees may, at the Companys discretion, be offered membership of the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme, an unfunded, unapproved arrangement under which their benefits including contingent death benefits would be increased to at least the level that would otherwise have been provided under the 103 BG Pension Scheme had they not been subject to an earnings cap.
Provision has been made in respect of the additional obligations for those post-retirement benefits for members of the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme.
A subsidiary undertaking operates a defined benefit pension scheme the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme which is closed to new entrants.
The scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
There is an unfunded post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect of employees of Comgas.
Provision has been made in respect of these post-retirement benefits.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes for its local employees in overseas businesses.
These are not material in Group terms.
UK GAAP SSAP 24 ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION COSTS An independent valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 31 March 2002 using the Projected Unit valuation method.
The financial assumptions used in these valuations are as follows: Valuation 31 Mar 2002 % Rate of price inflation and pensions increase 2.5 Discount rate for Schemes accrued liabilities 6.1 Future increases in pensionable pay 4.5 Discount rate for future service costs 7.0 The independent valuation showed that the aggregate market value of the Schemes assets as at 31 March 2002 was 241m, representing some 99% of the accrued liabilities in respect of BG Group employees on the assumptions set out above.
The level of employers contributions from 1 January 2003 was revised to adjust the funding level on a straight-line basis to 100% over time.
The last independent actuarial review of the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2002 based on salary and service at the date of valuation with no allowance for future salary increases, reflecting the expected cost of purchasing annuity policies to cover the schemes accrued liabilities with an insurance company.
This showed that the aggregate value of the schemes assets was 7m, which represented 122% of the schemes accrued liabilities.

A full valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2002.
A valuation of the schemes assets and expected liabilities as at 31 December 2003, and healthcare plan liabilities, was carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 based on the following assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 Comgas Comgas Comgas healthcare healthcare healthcare 104 BG schemes plan BG schemes plan BG schemes plan %% %%%% a Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 2.7 5.0 2.3 5.0 2.4 5.0 Future increases in earnings 4.7 n a 4.3 n a 4.4 n a Discount rate 5.4 11.3 5.6 11.3 5.7 11.3 b Healthcare cost trend rate n a 9.6 n a 9.7 n a 10.0 a Rate of pension increase in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.

Following this valuation the rate of employers contributions will be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.
US GAAP Calculations in respect of the US GAAP pension disclosures for the BG Pension Scheme, the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme for the year ended 31 December 2003 have been prepared using a measurement date of 31 December 2003.
For prior years, as permitted by Financial Accounting Standard FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, calculations in respect of US GAAP pension disclosures have been prepared using a measurement date of 30 September.
The 31 December measurement date more accurately reflects the plans funded status and net periodic pension cost for each year presented and provides a more useful comparison with the disclosures prepared under the UK accounting standard FRS 17.
The impact of the change in measurement date on the prior year numbers presented under FAS 87 is not material.
The long-term assumptions used in accounting for pension costs under US GAAP see note 29, page 110 were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 % %% 106 Expected long-term rate of return on assets 7.5 7.7 6.0 Rate of pension increase 2.7 2.3 2.4 Rate of salary increase 4.7 4.3 4.4 Discount rate 5.4 5.5 5.7 The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been determined following advice from the plans actuary and is based on the expected return on each asset class together with consideration of the long-term asset strategy.
The percentage of fair value of total assets in the plan for each major category of assets for the BG Pension Scheme and the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme is set out in the FRS 17 disclosure on page 104.
The Trustees of the pension plans are responsible for setting the investment strategy after consultation with the Company and professional advisors.
The Trustees consider that an appropriate strategy is achieved by adopting the following asset allocation as a benchmark for the BG Pension Scheme: an equity bond split of 85 15: within equities, a UK overseas split of 40 60: and within bonds, an index-linked fixed interest split of 30 70.
In addition, the Trustees have undertaken to ensure that there is sufficient investment in liquid or readily realisable assets to meet cash flow requirements so that the overall investment policy is not disrupted.
Assets of the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme are invested in index-linked gilts.

Under US GAAP, Financial Accounting Standard FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, prescribes the method and assumptions that may be used to calculate pension costs.
This method recognises the surplus deficit falling outside a 10% fluctuation corridor.
The supplementary disclosures required by FAS 87 and FAS 132, Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits are given in note 27, page 103.
The US GAAP pension costs and disclosures incorporate the requirements of FAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits.
b On 1 January 2002, BG Group adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Under UK GAAP, prior to the publication of FRS 10, 111 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill was taken to Group reserves immediately on acquisition.
As a result of the adoption of FRS 10, goodwill is now capitalised as an intangible fixed asset and amortised.
Before the adoption of FAS 142, goodwill under US GAAP was accounted for in line with FRS 10.
Under FAS 142, goodwill is allocated to the lowest identifiable cash-generating unit.
It is no longer amortised but is instead reviewed annually for impairment and the UK amortisation charge for the period has therefore been reversed within US net income.
On adoption in 2002, an impairment review of assets was undertaken in order to ascertain any transitional adjustment required and no adjustment was considered necessary.
Had FAS 142 been implemented in 2001, the net income and earnings per ADS figures would have been 335m and 0.48, respectively.
c Under US GAAP, BG Group recognised goodwill relating to assets held in Argentina.
Following the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, this goodwill was reviewed and deemed irrecoverable from future cash flows.
d Under US GAAP, as permitted under FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, BG Group accounts for stock options under Accounting Principles Board statement APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees as clarified by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No.
44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation FIN 44 and FIN 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.
In any ten year period, not more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or issuable under all schemes.
Details of the BG Group Company Share Option Scheme CSOS are given on page 61.
In any ten year period, not more than 5% of the issued share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under discretionary share option schemes, including the CSOS.
Under UK GAAP, Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 UITF 17, there is no profit and loss account charge in respect of these options as the exercise price is the same as the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
Under US GAAP, variable accounting is applied to this scheme and compensation expense, recognised rateably over the vesting period, is equal to the difference between the market value of the underlying share relating to the option and the exercise price.
At each reporting period, compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the market value of the shares since the date of grant.
No significant compensation expense has been recognised for any of the prior periods presented.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the CSOS is estimated using an option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 1.2% 2002 1.2%: 2001 1.2%, volatility of 32% 2002 38%: 2001 34%, risk-free rate of 4.47% 2002 4.35%: 2001 4.47% and an expected life of 5 years 2002 5 years: 2001 5 years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 0.85 per share 2002 0.92 per share: 2001 0.88 per share.
Details of the BG Group Sharesave Scheme are given on page 62.
In any five year period, not more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under all-employee share schemes.
Under UK GAAP, no profit and loss account charge is incurred in respect of this scheme as Save As You Earn schemes are exempt from the provisions of UITF 17.
In accordance with FIN 44, the 20% discount on the option price compared with the market price on the date of grant must be recognised as compensation expense over the saving period.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 29 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES CONTINUED The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the Sharesave Scheme is estimated using an option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 1.2% 2002 1.2%: 2001 1.2%, volatility of 31% 2002 39%: 2001 35%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 4.34% 2002 4.42%: 2001 4.71% and a weighted average expected life of 3.8 years 2002 3.8 years: 2001 3.9 years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 0.99 per share 2002 1.04 per share: 2001 1.02 per share.
Details of the BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS are given on page 61.
Notional allocations of shares under the LTIS scheme are made each year to eligible employees.
Under UK GAAP, costs of this Scheme are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the allocation, based upon the likelihood of the allocation vesting under the Scheme and the fair value of shares acquired to fulfil the allocation.
Under US GAAP, the profit and loss account charge is based upon the likelihood of the allocation vesting under the Scheme and the current market value of the shares required to fulfil the allocation.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year in respect of the LTIS is estimated using an option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 1.2% 2002 1.2%: 2001 1.2%, volatility of 32% 2002 38%: 2001 34%, a risk-free rate of 4.32% 2002 4.18%: 2001 4.42% and an expected life of 3 years 2002 3 years: 2001 4 years.
The fair value includes an allowance in respect of market performance conditions.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year was 1.30 per share 2002 1.22 per share: 2001 1.24 per share.
Details of the BG Group Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 62.
Free Shares awards were made under the SIP in 2003 and 2002.
Under both UK GAAP and US GAAP, the charge to the profit and loss account in respect of the award is based on the market value of the shares at the date of the allocation.
The fair value of the shares awarded during the year was 2.51 per share 2002 3.05 per share.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation: for the year ended 31 December 2003 2002 2001 m m m Net income as reported 766 393 294 Add: charges to net income under APB 25 net of tax 8 64 Deduct: charges determined under the fair value basis of FAS 123 net of tax 12 9 3 Pro-forma net income 762 390 295 Earnings per ADS as reported: Basic 1.09 0.56 0.42 Diluted 1.09 0.56 0.42 112 Pro-forma earnings per ADS: Basic 1.08 0.55 0.42 Diluted 1.08 0.55 0.42 e On 1 January 2003, BG Group adopted FAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
The standard requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred, if capable of estimation, concurrent with an increase in the related assets carrying value.
The increase in this carrying value is then amortised over its useful life.
Although similar to UK GAAP FRS 12, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, FAS 143 requires entities to use a credit-adjusted discount rate.
BG Group has used a rate of 5.5%.
Further details on decommissioning are given on page 98. f Under UK GAAP, where the Group has contractual rights to liquidated damages to reimburse income lost as a result of delays to commissioning of assets under construction, the liquidated damages are accounted for as income.
Liquidated damages recognised during 2003 have been accounted for under US GAAP as a reduction in the value of the asset constructed.
g FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by FAS 138 and FAS 149, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
In general, FAS 133 requires that companies recognise all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value.
BG Group uses derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies.
The terms of the instruments range between one and 15 years.
Commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives under FAS 133 are markedto-market and the fair value has been determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a credit adjusted risk-free discount rate.
The 269m 2002 99m reconciling difference between net assets under UK and US GAAP in respect of the valuation of these contracts comprises assets of 30m 2002 8m offset by liabilities of 299m 2002 107m, nil 2002 nil of which is included within net assets under UK GAAP.
On adoption of FAS 133, the current US GAAP hedging relationships for BG Groups existing currency and interest rate swaps were fide-designated and marked-to-market.
The fair value of these instruments has been determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.
The currency and interest rate derivative instruments are included within net assets under US GAAP as a 150m asset 2002 38m asset, comprising assets of 167m 2002 57m offset by liabilities of 17m 2002 19m.
Under UK GAAP, assets of 151m 2002 46m and liabilities of 1m 2002 2m have been recognised leading to a net asset of 150m 2002 44m.
There are a number of issues pending before the FASB, which may have a material impact on the application of FAS 133: and BG Groups results under US GAAP will continue to see volatility due to the requirements of this standard to mark-to-market a number of instruments and contracts at a point in time.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 29 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES CONTINUED Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 02-03, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, was issued in January 2002 and is effective from 25 October 2002 for all new contracts entered into after that date and for fiscal periods beginning after 15 December 2002 for contracts that remain in effect as of the date of the adoption of this standard.
EITF 02-03 replaces EITF 98-10 and addresses certain issues related to energy trading activities, including gross versus net presentation in the income statement, whether the initial fair value of an energy trading contract can be other than the price at which it was exchanged, mark-tomarket accounting when a contract does not meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133 and additional disclosure requirements for energy trading activities.
The adoption of this Issue has not had a material impact on BG Groups 2003 Financial Statements.
During 2003, energy trading activities, as defined by FAS 133, comprised forward based physicaland cash-settled gas contracts consisting of forwards, futures and options: and cash-settled oil futures contracts.
The fair value, based on external market quotes, of such commodity contracts included within net assets under US GAAP includes a liability of 8m 2002 9m asset relating to energy trading contracts.
The table below shows the reconciliation between the opening and closing values of BG Groups energy trading contracts: m Value of energy trading contracts as at 1 January 2003 9 Realised gains 9 Unrealised losses arising in 2003 8 Value of energy trading contracts as at 31 December 2003 8 The closing balance includes liabilities of 8m attributable to energy trading contracts maturing in 2004. h The disposal in 2003 of a number of UK North Sea gas production assets included an element of decommissioning obligations.
The difference between these obligations under UK and US GAAP has resulted in a difference in profit on disposal.
Under UK GAAP, periodic recoverability tests are performed on fixed assets.
Recognition is on the basis of discounted cash flows of income generating units.
Under US GAAP, before the adoption of FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, FAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, recognised impairments on the basis of undiscounted cash flows and measured on the basis of discounted cash flows.
The asset to which this adjustment related was disposed of in 2001 and the US GAAP adjustment therefore reversed.
i Under UK GAAP, currency translation adjustments on borrowings are taken to reserves to offset the foreign exchange exposure on foreign investments.
Under US GAAP, the currency translation adjustment on those borrowings would be expensed through the income statement.
113 j Under UK GAAP, provision for deferred income tax is required on a full provision basis in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Tax.
US GAAP FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, similarly requires deferred tax to be provided on a full liability basis.
The balance sheet adjustment is calculated under FAS 109 and the deferred tax balances carried forward under US GAAP are shown below: as at 31 December 2003 2002 m m Capital allowances for property, plant and equipment 710 735 Timing differences in respect of US GAAP adjustments 147 96 Petroleum revenue tax 27 24 Other deferred tax liabilities 196 94 786 757 Deferred tax assets 240 217 Net deferred tax liabilities under US GAAP 546 540 Net deferred tax recognised under UK GAAP 693 621 Net US GAAP adjustment 147 81 k In accordance with FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, BG Groups listed investments are revalued at each period end, with differences charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Under UK GAAP, investments are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
The aggregate fair value of the Groups available-for-sale equity securities as at 31 December 2003 was 32m 2002 9m.
There was no material difference between UK and US GAAP in prior years.
l Under UK GAAP, FRS 3, Reporting Financial Performance, requires that the disposal of businesses meeting specific criteria be reported as discontinued operations.
Operations not satisfying all these conditions are classified as continuing.
Under US GAAP, FAS 144 requires a different set of conditions to be fulfilled in order to classify a disposal of a business as discontinuing.
In 2003, BG Group disposed of its investments in a number of UK North Sea gas production assets and in Phoenix Natural Gas Limited and, in 2002, in Iqara EcoFuels Limited see note 6, page 87.
Also in 2003, BG Groups management committed to sell its investments in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement and in the Muturi Production Sharing Contract.
Management expects these sales to complete in 2004.
These are classified as discontinued operations under US GAAP.
m A reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share is arrived at by adjusting both the numerator and denominator with the adjustments given in note 10, page 90.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 Notes to the accounts continued 29 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES CONTINUED n Under US GAAP, Company shares not fully vested are regarded as treasury stock and recorded at cost as a reduction of shareholders equity.
In 2003, the UK GAAP requirement for these shares held by employee trusts to be shown within current assets at cost, less amounts written off, was changed so that they are now treated in a similar manner to US GAAP.
This change has not been retrospectively applied.
o Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are declared or proposed.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded only in the period in which they are formally declared.
EXPLANATION OF UK US RECONCILING DIFFERENCES NOT QUANTIFIED A Under FRS 3, income and expenses from non-recurring and significant transactions arising other than in the course of the Groups ordinary activities are recorded as exceptional items.
Items classified by BG Group as exceptional under UK GAAP see note 6, page 87 do not meet the definition of extraordinary under US GAAP and would be classified as operating items.
This difference does not result in a difference in net income under UK GAAP and US GAAP.
B In 2000, BG Group received proceeds of 168m in connection with the securitisation of receivables under the Premier Power CCGT transaction.
US GAAP treats these proceeds as debt compared to deferred revenue under UK GAAP.
No adjustment is required to the reconciliation of shareholders funds since the difference between the UK and US GAAP treatment is not significant as at 31 December 2003.
Under US GAAP, this would give rise to debt of 155m, as at 31 December 2003, bearing interest at a rate of 7.62% and maturing in March 2012.
The increase in US GAAP interest expense would be offset by increased turnover.
C Under UK GAAP, the balance sheets are presented in ascending order of liquidity, whereas under US GAAP assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.
Also under UK GAAP, the balance sheet is analysed between net assets and shareholders funds.
Under US GAAP, the analysis is between total assets and total liabilities plus shareholders equity.
Certain items which are disclosed in the notes under UK GAAP would be disclosed on the face of the balance sheet under US GAAP.
Also under US GAAP, debtors due after more than one year of 88m 2002 93m included within current assets in UK GAAP would be classified under long-term debtors.
D Under UK GAAP, BG Groups Financial Statements include a cash flow statement in accordance with FRS 1 revised 1996, Cash Flow Statements.
This statement presents substantially the same information as that required under FAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows.
FAS 95 only requires presentation of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows: for the year ended 31 December 2003 2002 2001 m m m 114 Net cash provided by operating activities 1 082 745 365 Net cash used in investing activities 811 1 311 448 Net cash used in provided by financing activities 301 623 110 Net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 30 57 27 Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year 141 92 65 Foreign exchange 1 8 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 112 141 92 Cash and cash equivalents are cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with a maturity or period of notice of 24 hours or one working day.
E In May 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 01-08, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
This Issue provides guidance for determining whether an arrangement for the right of use of property, plant and equipment contains a lease in accordance with FAS 13, Accounting for Leases.
If it is determined that a lease exists, the lease and non-lease components of a combined arrangement must be accounted for separately.
EITF 01-08 is effective for all arrangements initiated, modified or acquired in the first reporting period beginning after 28 May 2003.
The adoption of EITF 01-08 has not had an impact on BG Groups 2003 Financial Statements.
In February 2004, BG Group finalised an agreement to expand the regasification services provided by the Lake Charles terminal in the USA.
The agreement will be reviewed in the light of the requirements of EITF 01-08 during 2004.
F In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantees.
FIN 45 also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees.
It requires the guarantor to recognise a liability for the non-contingent component of the guarantee.
This is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur.
The initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception.
The recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements.
BG Group has adopted the disclosure requirements and has applied the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after 31 December 2002.
The adoption of this Interpretation did not affect shareholders funds or net income.
Since 1 January 2003, BG Group has issued or modified guarantees to joint ventures and associated undertakings with a maximum exposure of 419m.
Their fair value as at 31 December 2003 was 5m.
These guarantees relate to the Groups Egyptian LNG facilities.
Further disclosures about BG Groups guarantees, commitments and contingencies are given in note 25, page 101.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 29 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES CONTINUED G In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which interprets Accounting Research Bulletin ARB 51, Consolidated Financial Statements.
FIN 46 was replaced by FIN 46-R, containing significant revisions to the original Interpretation, in December 2003.
FIN 46-R clarifies the application of ARB 51 with respect to the consolidation of certain entities variable interest entities VIEs to which the usual condition for consolidation described in ARB 51 does not apply because the controlling financial interest in VIEs may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests.
In addition, FIN 46-R requires the primary beneficiary of VIEs and the holder of a significant variable interest in VIEs to disclose certain information relating to their involvement with the VIEs.
BG Group adopted FIN 46 for all entities created after 31 January 2003 and adopted FIN 46-R for all entities created before 1 February 2003.
The impact of the adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R has not had an effect on BG Groups 2003 Financial Statements.
NEW US GAAP ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
FAS 148 permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
The Statement also requires prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation.
BG Group has adopted the disclosure provisions of the Statement but has not adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as BG Group still accounts for these in accordance with APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
In May 2003, the FASB issued FAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
FAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
FAS 150 became effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after 31 May 2003.
For unmodified financial instruments existing at 31 May 2003, FAS 150 is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after 15 June 2003.
The standard does not affect BG Groups Financial Statements.
