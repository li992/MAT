A full description of the PSP is provided on page 91.
Details of the comparator groups which apply in respect of different awards are as follows for companies which subsequently delisted, the date of delisting is shown in brackets.

12.04 6.335 22.09.04 Notes 1 Form of award: Original LEAP participants were required to commit personal capital to the plan throughout the Investment Period.
They were entitled to receive a maximum award of five shares for every Investment Share committed to the plan, subject to WPP TSR performance.
Each LEAP unit was comprised of two separate elements: i a market value option over one share ordinary or ADR : and ii a bonus unit, with a value equal to the lower of the exercise price of the option and the share ADR price on the date payment is made.
Both parts of the award were subject to the same performance and investment conditions.
A full description of Original LEAP is provided on pages 91 and 92.
All awards shown in the above table, with the exception of Beth Axelrods arrangements see footnote 5 below, were dependent on WPPs TSR performance against a comparator group over the five-year performance period 1 January 1999 31 December 2003 and maintenance of a participants holding of Investment Shares and continued employment throughout the Investment Period.
The comparator group for this award was comprised of Aegis, Cordiant, Grey Advertising, Havas Advertising, IPG, AC Nielsen Media Research, Omnicom Group, Publicis, Saatchi & Saatchi, Snyder Communications, Taylor Nelson Sofres, True North Communications, WPP and Young & Rubicam.
Where a company delisted it is not included in the comparator group for further awards, for the purpose of measuring TSR performance.
Where a company delisted during the performance period, the committee deem this to be a disposal and the proceeds treated as being reinvested in the stock of the remaining companies.
2 To the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied, the option becomes exercisable for a three month period following the end of the Investment Period, the first and last dates of which are shown above.
In accordance with the requirements of xed plan accounting under US GAAP, any option not previously exercisable may become so in full, with no restriction or condition other than continued employment with the Group for a period of six weeks prior to the tenth anniversary of grant, when it will expire.
Messrs Paster and Richardson have already waived their right to the option and bonus elements of their respective awards, which are now structured as a transfer of shares with equivalent economic effect to the original bonus and option structure.
3 The portion of Paul Richardsons award which was made in November 2000 was subject to a maximum match of three shares.
4 The number of Sir Martin Sorrells matching shares includes those attributable to JMS.
5 The award made to Beth Axelrod was made under special arrangements, approved by the Compensation committee in contemplation of her appointment.
The award is subject to a reduced level of match ie without the minimum half-share.
The Performance Period for the award is the five-year period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006.
The comparator group is comprised of Aegis, Cordiant, Grey, Havas, IPG, Omnicom, Publicis, Taylor Nelson Sofres, True North and WPP.
In tandem with her Original LEAP award, a special award of 8,500 units of restricted stock was made.
This award is subject to continued employment with the Group and will lapse to the extent that her investment requirement under Original LEAP is not maintained.
6 The number of matching units at 1 January 2003 represents the maximum potential match achievable under LEAP at the beginning of the financial year i. e. a five times match, subject to footnote 3.
The performance period for Messrs Paster, Richardson, and Sorrell ended on 31 December 2003.
The committee has since determined, on the basis of a TSR calculation conducted using external independent data sources, that WPP ranked 6th in the comparator group and that, subject to the ongoing investment requirements until September 2004, 3 matching shares shall vest for every investment share held.
The shares shown to have lapsed represent the reduction from the potential maximum number of shares that could have vested to the actual amount of shares that will vest subject to the ongoing investment requirements for Beth Axelrod, no shares have lapsed as the performance period does not end until 31 December 2006.
The number of shares at 31 December 2003 represents the final number of matching shares, based on the 3 times match, that will vest in September 2004, subject to the ongoing investment requirements except for Beth Axelrod, for whom there is shown the potential maximum match as the performance period does not end until December 2006.
7 The 12 month high share price was 5.96 and the 12 month low share price was 3.20.
The share price on 31 December 2003 was 5.485.
