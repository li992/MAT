The Group is responsible for the eligibility of the receivables that it sells.
In 2003 the Group entered into a non recourse sale and assignment of receivables within Europe.
As at 4 January 2004 the cash received was 9.5 million.
This has not been netted off against debtors.

Hedges As explained in the Financial Review on pages 22 and 23 the Group has hedged interest rate risk using both interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements and transactional currency exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
There are no unrecognised gains losses against hedged foreign currency assets and liabilities as these have been translated at the forward contract rates.

In a number of jurisdictions companies have a constructive obligation to remedy any known environmental problems.

This cancellation was confirmed by an Order of the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, on 14 July 1993.
The amount of 88.9 million standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account on 14 July 1993 was transferred to the Special Reserve against which goodwill on consolidation can be written off.
This reserve, together with the amounts standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account on 12 October 1990 of 71.5 million, on 19 June 1987 of 38.9 million and on 27 July 1989 of 12.3 million which were transferred following previous Orders of the High Court, becomes distributable to the extent of subsequent increases in issued Share Capital and Share Premium Account.
The amount of reserves of The Morgan Crucible Company plc that may not be distributed under Section 264 3 of the Companies Act l985 is 207.5 million 2002: 179.5 million.
The cumulative amount of goodwill eliminated against reserves in respect of subsidiary undertakings continuing to trade as members of the Group and which has not subsequently been written off through the profit and loss account is 205.0 million 2002: 216.8 million.
The 205.0 million has been debited against the Merger reserve 77.7 million and the Special reserve 127.3 million.

26 Leasing Commitments Operating leasing commitments during the next year, for which no provision has been made in these accounts, are: The Group The Company Land and Land and buildings Other buildings Other m m m m 2004 0.7 0.4 0.1 2005 0.5 0.3 2006 0.9 2.0 0.3 2007 0.1 0.5 2008 0.5 0.4 2009 and thereafter 3.7 1.5 6.4 3.6 1.8 0.1 27 Pensions and other retirement costs The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major schemes are of the funded defined benefit type.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustee of The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SSS is Law Debenture MC Senior Pension Trust Corporation: the trustee of The Morgan Pension Scheme MPS is Morgan Crucible Pension Trustees Limited, both of which are wholly owned subsidiary undertakings of The Law Debenture Pension Trust Corporation Plc.
Both have been trustees of the UK schemes since 1986.
Neither of the UK schemes holds any shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, has loaned or will loan any scheme assets to the Company or its subsidiary undertakings or made or will make any cash loan to the Company or its subsidiary undertakings.
The total pension cost for the Group was 21.6 million 2002: 20.8 million of which 15.4 million 2002: 16.4 million relates to the overseas schemes.
The pension cost relating to the UK schemes, The MPS and The SSS is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The latest actuarial valuations of The MPS and The SSS were on 6 April 2002 and 1 April 2003 respectively.
At those dates the market values of the assets of the two schemes were 150 million and 62.9 million respectively and the actuarial values of the assets were sufficient to cover 106% of the benefits that had accrued to members of The MPS and 88% of the benefits that had accrued to members of The SSS after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The MPS surplus has been allocated towards the reduction of employer contribution rates over the average remaining service lives of members of the scheme which is approximately 13 years, whilst the SSS employer contribution rates have been increased to pay off the deficit, the rates to be reviewed at subsequent valuations.
62 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Notes to the accounts 27 Pensions and other retirement costs continued The average annual assumptions used for calculating the pension cost under SSAP24 are: MPS SSS Investment return 7.0% 7.0% Pay increases 5.0% 5.0% Retail Price Index increases 3.0% 3.0% The Group operates approximately 70 overseas schemes with some 25% of these schemes being defined contribution schemes.
Most of the defined benefit schemes are operated in the USA, Australia, Italy and Germany.
A review of the major overseas schemes was carried out during 2003 and no material surpluses, or unprovided deficiencies on a current funding level, were identified which required adjustment in the accounts.
A further review is planned for 2004.
The charge to the profit and loss account in respect of the overseas schemes has been determined in accordance with SSAP24 or local best practice.
Where local best practice is followed the resulting charge is not materially different from SSAP24.
The disclosure requirements under FRS17 are in note 30.
Four of the US subsidiary undertakings provide post retirement medical care to former employees.
These costs are accounted for on an accruals basis with the estimated actuarial liability being amortised over the average life of the relevant employees.
The cost for the year was 0.3 million 2002: 0.4 million.
The estimated actuarial liability is 1.6 million 2002: 1.9 million.
28 Guarantees and contingent liabilities Guarantees by The Morgan Crucible Company plc have been given for bank facilities of subsidiary undertakings totalling 86.6 million 2002: 40.0 million of which 86.6 million 2002: 40.0 million have been utilised.
The Company has also issued guarantees for the performance by certain subsidiary undertakings of obligations under leases and a Precious Metals facility in the USA.
There are contingent liabilities on bills discounted by the Group amounting to 0.2 million 2002: 0.3 million.
The Group is the subject of legal claims in the US that arose subsequent to the conclusion in 2002 of the US Department of Justice anti-trust enquiry.
These claims are being vigorously defended.
The competition investigations in Canada remain ongoing whereas those in Europe have been concluded without any fines being imposed on the Group.
The Board, having taken legal advice, are of the opinion that the ongoing actions investigations will not have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
In an international group a variety of claims arise from time to time.
Provision has been made in these accounts against those claims which the Directors consider meet the requirements of FRS12 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and are likely to result in significant liabilities.
29 Related parties The Directors have reviewed transactions with related parties as defined in FRS8, Related Party Disclosures and have concluded that there are no material transactions which require disclosure which have not been acknowledged elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts.
