AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements Form 20-F Information 2003 81 18 Financial instruments A discussion of the Groups objective, policy and strategy in respect of risk management and the use of financial instruments is included in the Financial Review on pages 31 to 42.
The following disclosures exclude all short term, trade related debtors and creditors.
Interest rate risks of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile, after taking into account interest and cross-currency swaps, of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2003 was: Financial Weighted Weighted assets liabilities average average on which fixed period for Floating Fixed no interest is interest which rate rate rate paid received Total rate is fixed $m $m $m $m % Years Financial liabilities US dollar 430 8 438 11.5 9.7 Other 17 17 447 8 455 Financial assets US dollar 3,542 111 3,653 Euro 8 8 Sterling 176 141 317 SEK 43 22 65 Other 128 128 3,897 274 4,171 The floating rate financial liabilities comprise largely of fixed rate debt that has been swapped into floating rate debt.
The long dated $300m US dollar bond reverts back to a fixed rate in 2009.
The financial liabilities also include $152m of short term bank borrowings and overdrafts, bearing interest at rates fixed by reference to local interbank rates.
The financial assets principally comprise cash on overnight deposit and short term investments with an average maturity of 29 days.
These include deposits where the interest rate is fixed until maturity but, as the original maturity is less than one year, they are classified as floating rate financial instruments.
The main benchmark rates for euro and US dollar financial assets are the relevant LIBID rates.
Financial assets include $220m of other fixed asset investments on which no interest is received.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements 82 Form 20-F Information 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 18 Financial instruments continued Currency exposures 100% of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, as at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group companies concerned, having taken into account the effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been used to match foreign currency exposures.
Additionally, in 2003 and 2002, approximately 50% of forecast future foreign currency transaction exposures extending for 12 months were selectively hedged.
The policy has been modified in 2004 to cover movements outside specified limits on 95% of these transaction exposures.
The principal currency exposures sterling, Swedish kronor SEK, euros, Australian dollars AUD, Canadian dollars CAD and Japanese yen were hedged using a mixture of purchased currency options and forward foreign exchange contracts.
As at 31 December 2003, the forecast future foreign currency transaction exposures were: 2003 2002 Forecast Forecast exposures exposures $m $m Sterling payables 2,517 2,374 SEK payables 1,422 1,006 Euro receivables 2,194 1,780 Yen receivables 444 306 AUD receivables 255 201 CAD receivables 482 336 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short term creditors such as trade creditors and accruals, at 31 December 2003 was as follows: 2003 2002 Analysis by year of repayment Loans Other Total Loans Other Total $m $m $m $m $m $m After five years 303 303 308 308 From five to four years 13 13 From four to three years From three to two years From two to one years 7 7 Due after more than one year 303 303 328 328 Due within one year 152 152 314 328 642 303 152 455 642 328 970 Other financial liabilities comprise short term borrowings and, at 31 December 2002, deferred payments to re-acquire certain distribution rights.

The Group had a standby letter of credit covering these financial liabilities which was collateralised by high grade government securities.
The liabilities were settled in 2003 and the standby letter of credit cancelled at the same time.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements 84 Form 20-F Information 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 18 Financial instruments continued The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: a.
Short term investments the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments carrying values approximate fair value.
Fixed asset investments excluding equity investments in joint ventures and associates the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
c. Loans the fair value of publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given frequency of resets: the fair value of remaining debt is estimated using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.
d. Forward foreign exchange contracts the Group has forward foreign exchange contracts to sell currency for the purpose of hedging nondollar commercial transaction exposures which existed at the date of the balance sheet and to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, non-dollar commercial transactions for 2004.
The majority of the contracts for existing transactions had a maturity of six months or less from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based on market forward foreign exchange rates at year end.
e. Foreign currency option contracts the Group has foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, nondollar commercial transactions for 2004.
The fair value of option contracts is estimated using Black-Scholes valuation techniques as adapted by Garman and Kohlhagen.
f. Interest rate and cross-currency swaps AstraZeneca uses interest rate and cross-currency swaps to hedge the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange movements on borrowings in accordance with a formal risk management strategy.
The fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.
The above financial instruments are subject to credit and market risk.
AstraZeneca contains credit risk through the use of counterparty and product specific credit limits and by ongoing review procedures.
All financial instruments are transacted with commercial banks and, in line with standard market practice, are not backed with cash collateral.
The notional principal values of off balance sheet financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group of these instruments.
The credit risk of these instruments is limited to the positive fair values of such contracts.
Market risk is the sensitivity of the value of financial instruments to changes in related currency and interest rates.
The Group is not exposed to material market risk because gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions subject to hedge.
Hedges The Groups policy was to hedge 100% of transactional currency exposures and approximately 50% of forecast future transaction exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts.
It also uses cross-currency and interest rate swaps to manage its borrowings profile.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains $m $m $m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 January 2003 108 108 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in 2003 57 57 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were not recognised in 2003 51 51 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 129 21 108 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 89 21 68 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 or later 40 40
