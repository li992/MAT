Notes to the Accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and in accordance with all applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The financial statements are in compliance with the Companies Act 1985 except that, as explained below, investment properties are not depreciated.
"As explained in note 27, comparative figures have been restated following the adoption of Urgent Issues Task Force ""UITF"" Abstract 38 ""Accounting for ESOP trusts""."
Basis of Consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries, together with the groups share of results, assets, liabilities and cash flows arising from joint investments and developments.
Foreign Currencies All assets, liabilities and results denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
The principal foreign currency used is the euro and the exchange rate ruling at 31 December 2003 was 1 1.42 31 December 2002 : 1 1.53.
Differences arising from the translation of the net equity investment in overseas subsidiaries and currency loans for such investments are dealt with through reserves.
Differences arising on the revaluation surplus are accounted for in the revaluation reserve.
Other differences resulting from the conversion of one currency into another are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Net Rental Income Rent increases arising from rent reviews are taken into account when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Where a lease incentive does not enhance the property, it is amortised over the period to the earlier of the first rent review, the first break option, or the end of the lease term.
On new leases with rent free periods, rental income is allocated evenly over the period from the date of lease commencement to the date of the first rent review.
Differences between property operating expenditure incurred and that recovered from tenants through service charges are included in net rental income.
Profits on Sale of Properties Profits on sale of properties are taken into account on the completion of contract.
Profits arising from the sale of trading properties acquired with a view to resale are included in the profit and loss account as part of the operating profit of the group.
Profits or losses arising from the sale of investment properties are calculated by reference to book value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure, and treated as exceptional items.
Cost of Properties The net development outgoings, including interest, attributable to properties held for development or resale are added to the cost of such properties.
Lease incentives which enhance the property are added to the cost of properties.
A property is regarded as being in the course of development until ready for its intended use.
For buildings that are let this will be when construction and fitting out are complete, whilst for unlet buildings this will be at the end of the construction period.
Valuation of Properties Properties held for the long term are valued at the balance sheet date at market value.
Surpluses and deficits arising from revaluation are taken to the revaluation reserve.
Properties held for resale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Where properties held for resale are transferred to or from the investment portfolio, they are transferred at market value.
Depreciation In accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
"19 ""Accounting for investment properties"", no depreciation is provided in respect of freehold properties or leasehold properties with over 20 years to expiry."
This is a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 which requires all properties to be depreciated.
Such properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that to depreciate them would not give a true and fair view.
Depreciation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation of properties and accordingly the amount of depreciation which might otherwise have been charged cannot be separately identified or quantified.
The directors consider that this policy results in the accounts giving a true and fair view.
Depreciation is provided on fixtures, fittings and equipment on a straight line basis having regard to their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.. 24 Notes to the Accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Borrowing Expenses All costs incurred directly in connection with the issue of debt are deducted from the proceeds and the net amount included in liabilities.
The costs, together with any discount on issue, are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Financial Derivatives The group uses forward rate agreements and interest rate and currency swaps to help manage its exposures to movements in interest and exchange rates.
Differences between interest payable and receivable on interest rate swaps are dealt with, on an accruals basis, within the groups cost of finance.
In the case of currency swaps, which are used to hedge foreign currency assets, any differences arising on translation at the balance sheet date are taken to reserves.
Tax The tax charge on disposals is allocated between the current element, which is included in the profit and loss account and the element relating to prior years revaluation gains, which is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences and is reduced by available tax losses.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
No provision is made for tax that may arise on the future disposal of the groups properties.
Pensions The costs of the groups defined benefit pension schemes are spread over the remaining service lives of participants of the schemes.. 25 Notes to the Accounts 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Gross Other 2003 2002 rental Rents property Net rental Net rental income payable outgoings income income m m m m m Rental income United Kingdom Retail: Shopping centres London & South 50.5 0.9 5.7 43.9 41.5 Midlands & North 23.7 0.5 4.9 18.3 23.5 Retail parks 17.1 0.8 16.3 4.6 91.3 1.4 11.4 78.5 69.6 Office: City 31.1 5.0 1.0 25.1 29.4 West End 13.1 0.4 0.6 12.1 16.1 Docklands & other 12.0 1.4 1.7 8.9 8.8 56.2 6.8 3.3 46.1 54.3 Total United Kingdom 147.5 8.2 14.7 124.6 123.9 Continental Europe Retail: France 42.4 4.6 37.8 32.7 Germany 17.8 0.3 5.7 11.8 11.8 60.2 0.3 10.3 49.6 44.5 Office: France 16.1 0.8 15.3 7.5 Total Continental Europe 76.3 0.3 11.1 64.9 52.0 Group Retail 151.5 1.7 21.7 128.1 114.1 Office 72.3 6.8 4.1 61.4 61.8 Total Group 223.8 8.5 25.8 189.5 175.9 Included in net rental income for 2003 is 8.8m 2002: 2.5m in respect of accrued rent receivable allocated to rent free periods and a deduction of 0.8m 2002: 0.9m in respect of amortisation of lease incentives.

The Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 January 2003 and a Group Personal Pension Plan has been established for new employees.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the Attained Age method.
The most recent actuarial investigation was carried out at 31 December 2002.
Principal actuarial assumptions 31 December 2002 Rate of investment return 7.0% Increase in pensionable salaries 3.0% Increase in retail price index 2.5% Increase in pensions in payment 2.5% Valuation of investments Market values At the date of this actuarial investigation, the market value of the assets was 17.7m, and the actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 82% of the benefits that had accrued to members after fully allowing for future salary increases.
In calculating the net pension expense the deficit is amortised over the remaining expected service lives of the employees on a percentage of salary basis.
As far as cash payments are concerned, the deficit is being recovered over a ten year period to July 2013 by fixed monetary amounts.
"Financial Reporting Standard 17 ""Retirement Benefits"" ""FRS17"" The full requirements of FRS 17 must be adopted for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005."

The value of the unfunded commitment at 31 December 2003 amounted to 1.0m 2002: 0.8m.
This liability has been included in creditors on the groups balance sheet.
The assumptions used for the purposes of the FRS 17 valuation of the scheme are the same as those used for the Hammerson Group Management Pension & Life Assurance Scheme.
The liability under the scheme was 1.0m at 31 December 2003 2002: 0.8m.
US unfunded unapproved scheme The US unfunded pension commitment relates to obligations to five former employees.
The value of the liability has been calculated by a qualified actuary using the Attained Age method.
An actuarial investigation was carried out at 31 December 2003 with the principal actuarial assumptions being a rate of investment return of 6.5% and an increase in pensions in payment of 5.0%.
At the date of this actuarial investigation the present value of the pension commitment was 4.1m.
This liability is included in creditors on the groups balance sheet.
For the purpose of FRS 17 for both 2002 and 2003, the discount rate for scheme liabilities was 6.5% and the increase in pensions in payment was assumed to be 5.0%.
The present value of the liabilities at 31 December 2003 amounted to 4.1m 2002: 4.5m.

The shares of Hammerson plc, which were included in investments at an amortised cost of 2.2m at 31 December 2002, are now shown as a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
The group has an effective 33.5% interest in Value Retail Investors Limited Partnership I and an effective 27.5% interest in Value Retail Investors Limited Partnership II, both of which have interests in a designer outlet centre in Bicester, in the United Kingdom.
The interests were acquired at a total cost of 17.1m and are included at a total value, based on the market value of the underlying property, at 31 December 2003 of 25.3m, the property elements of which have been reviewed by Donaldsons, Chartered Surveyors.
These investments have not been consolidated within the group accounts as the group does not have significant influence over the management of the partnerships.
Investments in Value Retail plc and certain related companies are included at cost.
Other investments include the groups 14% stake in Stonemartin plc, which was purchased in July 2001 for 4.0m.
"Stonemartin plc, which operates serviced offices under the brand name of the Institute of Directors, is listed on the Alternative Investment Market ""AIM"" and at the balance sheet date the investment has been included at market value."

The analysis above reflects the effect of currency and interest rate swaps in place at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002.
The Company has a 10m interest rate swap maturing in 2011 which is cancellable by the counterparty at 30 September 2004 and annually thereafter.
Under this swap the Company receives interest at a fixed rate of 6.875% and pays interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR.
