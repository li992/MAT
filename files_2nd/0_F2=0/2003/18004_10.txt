Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements Notes to the Financial :59 Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 1 Principal Accounting Policies A summary of the principal accounting policies of the group, all of which have been applied consistently throughout this and the preceding year, is set out below.
1 Accounting Convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties in accordance with Note 1 4 below, and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
2 Basis of Consolidation On 4 December 2001 a restructuring of the group was completed and a new ultimate holding company was introduced by way of a scheme of arrangement in accordance with Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The new holding company was incorporated on 30 March 2001 as a public company, Dolphincove plc.
On 15 October 2001 it changed its name to New Canary Wharf plc.
In order to maintain continuity following implementation of the scheme, New Canary Wharf plc changed its name to Canary Wharf Group plc on 4 December 2001, whilst the previous company of that name has been re-incorporated as a private limited company and changed its name to Canary Wharf Estate Limited.
The financial statements include consolidated accounts for Canary Wharf Group plc formerly New Canary Wharf plc and its subsidiaries at 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003.
The combination of New Canary Wharf plc with Canary Wharf Group plc has been accounted for using merger accounting in accordance with the group reconstruction provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 6 Acquisitions and Mergers.
Consequently, although the combination did not become effective until 4 December 2001, the financial statements of the combined group are presented as if the merged businesses had always been part of the same group.
Accordingly, the results of the group for the entire year ended 30 June 2002 are shown in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The directors have adopted the basis of preparation set out above because they consider that it is necessary in order to give a true and fair view of the results of the group for the year ended 30 June 2002 consistent with the financial period adopted by the group previously.
The effect of not doing so would have been to present only the results for the period since the combination became effective on 4 December 2001.
Group restructuring expenses have been treated as an exceptional item in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 3 Reporting Financial Performance.
This transaction did not give rise to deferred tax in the prior year.
3 Profit and Loss Account Turnover, which is stated net of VAT, comprises rental income and service charges.
Marketing and administrative costs which are not development expenses are charged to the profit and loss account when incurred.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 60: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 4 Property Interests The groups property interests comprise investment properties, properties under construction and properties held for development.
Investment properties Investment properties are revalued annually and in accordance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties no provision is made for depreciation.
This departure from the requirements of the statutory accounting rules, which require all properties to be depreciated, is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view.
Depreciation is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount attributable to this factor is not capable of being separately identified or quantified.
Surpluses or deficits on investment properties are transferred to the revaluation reserve, unless a deficit is expected to be permanent and exceeds previous surpluses recognised on the same property, in which case the excess is charged to the profit and loss account.
Properties under construction and properties held for development Properties held for development and properties under construction which are to be retained are categorised as fixed assets and included in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value at the date of the acquisition by Canary Wharf Estate Limited of the Canary Wharf Holdings Limited CWHL group in December 1995, together with subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent disposals, subject to any provision for impairment.
Properties under construction which are to be retained are transferred to investment properties on an individual building basis when construction is complete and the properties are substantially let.
Properties under construction or held for development where the group has entered into an agreement for sale are categorised as current assets and stated at the lower of cost namely fair value at date of acquisition plus subsequent additions at cost and net realisable value.
Profits on sale of such properties are recognised on completion of the sale contract.
Additions to properties under construction or held for development include all expenses of development, including attributable interest where appropriate.
Interest capitalised is calculated by reference to the rate of interest payable on the borrowings drawn down to finance the development.
5 Lease Incentives Lease incentives include rent-free periods and other incentives given to lessees on entering into lease agreements.
Under UITF 28 the aggregate cost of lease incentives is recognised as an adjustment to rental income, allocated evenly over the lease term or the term to the first open market rent review OMR if earlier.
The cost of other lease incentives is included within prepayments and spread on a straight line basis over a similar period.
Accordingly the valuation of investment properties is reduced for these incentives.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :61 6 Other Tangible Fixed Assets Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated so as to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Computer equipment 33% Fixtures and equipment 25% 7 Debt Debt instruments are stated initially at the amount of the net proceeds.
The finance costs of such debt instruments are allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the reporting period and reduced by payments made in respect of the debt in that period.
Finance costs are charged to the profit and loss account, except in the case of development financings where interest and related financing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of development.
Amounts receivable and payable, arising from derivatives which hedge interest rate exposures, are treated as part of financing costs.
8 Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
9 Finance Leases Sales and leasebacks where the leaseback is treated as a finance lease, as required by SSAP 21 and FRS 5 are recorded in the balance sheet as assets and as obligations to pay future rentals.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance charge and a reduction in the outstanding obligation for future amounts payable.
The total finance charge, which includes the amortisation of deferred expenses relating to finance leases, is allocated to accounting periods over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic charge on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
10 Vacant Leasehold Property Provision is made for the present value of the anticipated net commitments in relation to leasehold properties where there is a shortfall in rental income receivable against the rent and other costs payable.
11 Pensions The group operates two defined contribution pension schemes.
Pension contributions in respect of these schemes are accrued as they fall due.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 62: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 12 Share Option Schemes The economic cost to the group of share option schemes is charged to the same expense category as the employment cost of the relevant employee, spread on a straight line basis over the relevant performance criteria period.
The economic cost represents either the acquisition cost of the shares or the market value of the shares at the date the options are granted, less any amount recoverable from the employee.
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the groups share option schemes are recorded as an investment in own shares within fixed asset investments and shown net of accumulated amortisation.
Where relevant, provision is made for employers National Insurance contributions based on the market value of the share options at the balance sheet date and spread on a straight line basis over the period of the relevant performance criteria.
13 Deferred Taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the corporation tax return.
Under FRS 19 deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse or, where the timing differences are not expected to reverse, a period not exceeding 50 years.
Discount rates of 3.2% to 3.5% have been adopted reflecting the post-tax yield to maturity that can be obtained on government bonds with similar maturity dates and currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :63 2 Segmental Reporting The Operating and Financial Review includes a discussion of segmental information and a summary of the properties in each segment see pages 26 and 27.
For the purposes of the segmental information which follows, properties are stated on the basis adopted for statutory reporting purposes, which does not reflect any revaluation of properties under construction or held for development.

Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :67 10 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by reference to the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 9.5 million June 2002 profit of 193.0 million and on the weighted average of 585.5 million shares in issue June 2002 642.9 million.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 June 2003 is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 9.5 million year ended 30 June 2002 profit of 193.0 million and the diluted weighted average of 585.5 million shares June 2002 649.8 million.
For the year ended 30 June 2003, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of calculating the diluted earnings per share is identical to that used for basic earnings per ordinary share.
This is because the exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not treated as dilutive under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 14 Earnings per share.
The calculation of the number of shares which are dilutive is based on the number of each instrument outstanding Note 19 as adjusted for the difference between the exercise price and the weighted average share price for the relevant year.
The basic earnings per share excluding exceptional items and diluted earnings per share excluding exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2003 have been calculated on the loss for that year of 9.6 million year ended 30 June 2002 profit of 12.5 million, excluding exceptional items totalling a profit of 0.1 million year ended 30 June 2002 180.5 million.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 68: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 11 Investment Properties and Properties Under Construction and Held for Development Freehold properties held as tangible fixed assets: Properties Properties Investment Under Held for Properties Construction Development m m m Market value at 1 July 2002 3,278.8 936.6 178.7 Adjustment for UITF 28 as at 1 July 2002 10.7 Carrying value as at 1 July 2002 3,268.1 936.6 178.7 Additions including interest 2.2 733.3 45.1 Transfer of completed properties 760.7 760.7 Revaluation 151.8 As at 30 June 2003 4,182.8 909.2 223.8 Adjustment for UITF 28 at 30 June 2003 47.7 Market value at 30 June 2003 4,230.5 Of which, subject to lease and finance leaseback arrangements 1,015.5 Historical cost 2,491.8 909.2 223.8 During the year ended 30 June 2003 the group completed construction of five buildings that were retained as investment properties, 5 Canada Square, 20 Canada Square, 16-19 Canada Square, 20 Bank Street and 40 Bank Street.
These properties have been revalued externally by either FPDSavills Commercial Limited, Chartered Surveyors or CB Richard Ellis Limited, Surveyors and Valuers, at 30 June 2003 on the basis of Market Value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Market Value.
This resulted in surpluses upon revaluation of 415.4 million which have been taken to the revaluation reserve.
The groups other investment properties have also been valued as at 30 June 2003 on the basis of Market Value.
These valuations were undertaken by either FPDSavills Commercial Limited or CB Richard Ellis Limited.
Each property has been valued individually on a free and clear basis and not as part of a portfolio and no account has been taken of any intra-group loans or arrangements.
Whilst allowance has been made for any purchasers expenses no allowance has been made for any sellers expenses of realisation nor for any taxation which may arise in the event of disposal Note 18.
The allowance for purchasers expenses has been reduced from 5.75% to 1.75% taking account of the stamp duty relief for properties in disadvantaged areas announced in the 2003 Budget.
The net surplus arising on the year end valuations, including that on properties completed during the year 151.8 million, has been transferred to the revaluation reserve.
Properties under construction and properties held for development at 30 June 2003 which are to be retained are carried at their fair value at the time of the acquisition of the CWHL group in December 1995, less subsequent disposals plus additions at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :69 At 30 June 2003 properties under construction held as fixed assets included 87.6 million 30 June 2002 67.2 million in respect of financing costs.
In April 2002 8 Canada Square achieved practical completion and the building was sold under the terms of a development agreement entered into in October 1998.
The sale of this property resulted in a profit on disposal of 169.5 million which was shown as an exceptional item in the profit and loss account for the year ended 30 June 2002.

Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 70: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 At 30 June 2003 the companys principal subsidiary undertakings, all of which were incorporated and registered in the UK and wholly owned, were as follows: Name Description of Shares Principal Activities Canary Wharf Two Limited 1 Ordinary Holding company Canary Wharf Estate Limited 1 Ordinary Holding company Canary Wharf Holdings Limited 1 Ordinary Holding company 1 Preferred Redeemable Canary Wharf Limited 1 Ordinary Property development 1 Preferred Redeemable Canary Wharf Investments Limited 1 Ordinary Property investment 1 Deferred Canary Wharf Contractors Limited 1 Ordinary Property construction Canary Wharf Management Limited 1 Ordinary Property management Heron Quays Properties Limited 1 Ordinary Property development Norquil Limited 1 Ordinary Property investment Canary Wharf Finance II plc CWFII 1 Ordinary Investment company CW Lending II Limited 1 Ordinary Investment company Canary Wharf Finance plc CWF 1 Ordinary Investment company CW Lending Limited 1 Ordinary Investment company Those held directly by the parent company are marked with an asterisk.

In October 1996 the group sold its interest in the limited partner companies of the First Tower Limited Partnership subject to payment of deferred consideration contingent on the satisfaction of certain conditions.
During the year to 30 June 2002 these conditions were confirmed as having been satisfied and the group received 13.4 million net of expenses.
In the year to 30 June 2003 the group became entitled to receive an additional 2.9 million net of expenses.
These amounts, which did not give rise to deferred tax are recognised in the profit and loss account as exceptional items.
In March 2001, the group acquired 52,079 1 ordinary shares and 2,604 convertible shares in HighSpeed Office Limited HSO, an unlisted company registered in England and Wales, being approximately 13% of its nominal share capital.
The principal activity of HSO is the provision of broadband telecommunications services.
The consideration paid was 2.1 million representing the historical cost to the group including fees.
At 30 June 2003 the carrying value of the investment was written down by 0.5 million to 1.1 million, representing the net asset value of HSO at that date.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :71 During 2001 the company acquired 5.2 million of its own shares at a cost of 26.8 million in connection with certain of the groups share option schemes.
Such shares are initially recorded at cost and written down to the exercise price over the period to vesting.
Prior to the payment of the special dividend on 29 November 2002 the exercise price for the relevant schemes was 4.00 per share.
As a result of the special dividend, the amount payable by employees on exercise was reduced from 4.00 to 3.3117.
The carrying value of the groups investment in own shares has accordingly been reduced in order to reflect the reduction in the amount recoverable.
This has resulted in an exceptional charge to operating profit of 2.8 million during the year.

7 On 3 November 2000 the group concluded a seven year, 1 billion revolving construction loan facility.
On 30 May 2003, notice to reduce the facility by 250 million to 750 million became effective.
At 30 June 2003 76.8 million of a 407.0 million commitment allocated to the construction of 1 Churchill Place had been drawn down leaving 343 million of the facility available to fund construction of other buildings.
Drawings under the facility are secured by first-ranking fixed and floating charges over the properties which are subject to the financing and by the guarantee of the parent company.
Drawings bear interest at a margin of 1% over LIBOR and are repayable on the date falling three months after the scheduled completion date for the property being financed, subject to the groups ability to extend on certain conditions.
8 In October 2001 the group entered into a further 125 million construction loan facility, of which a total of 82.3 million was drawn down in connection with construction of the property at 20 Canada Square.
Interest was incurred at a margin of 1% over LIBOR.
In March 2003, the loan was repaid in full following completion of the building.
9 Upon repayment of the construction facility secured on 20 Canada Square, a group company entered into an investment loan in a principal amount of 225 million.
The proceeds of this loan were used in part to repay the balance on the 125.0 million construction loan Note 17 8 with the balance for general corporate purposes.
Interest is charged at LIBOR plus 1.125%.
The loan has been fully hedged at 6.056% and is repayable by instalments from April 2008 with a final maturity in 2025.
The loan is secured by first ranking fixed and floating charges over 20 Canada Square.
In addition a group company has entered into a rental guarantee of a minimum of 2.8 million and a maximum of 3.4 million per quarter.
The rental guarantee will be reduced in the event of further lettings in the building.
10 In January 2003 a group company drew down 85.0 million on a bank facility to fund the redemption of the D notes BBB rated of the December 1997 securitisation Note 17 1.
The term of the facility is eighteen months to July 2004.
The loan carries interest of LIBOR plus 2.1% subject to an interest rate collar arrangement which serves to cap the portion linked to LIBOR to 5.5%.
The loan is secured by way of a second charge over the property interests included in the CWF securitisation and by an interest guarantee from Canary Wharf Limited.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 78: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 11 In December 2002, the group entered into a facility to borrow up to 605 million secured against 1 Churchill Place, a property that is currently under construction.
The facility may be drawndown when the property has reached practical completion, which is expected in July 2004, and the related construction facility has been repaid.
The amount which may be drawn is dependent on the amortisation period chosen.
A minimum of 529 million may be drawn on the basis of paying interest only for the first ten years of the facility whereas drawings can be increased to 605 million on a fully amortising basis.
The loan is currently hedged to reflect the 529 million minimum drawing resulting in a hedged interest rate of 5.82% and a final maturity in July 2034.
If a shorter amortisation period is chosen, the increased borrowings will require additional hedging.
12 On 1 October 2001 the group concluded the acquisition from HSBC of Indural Holdings Limited Indural for a consideration of 3.1 million.
In December 1997 Indural entered into agreements for lease in respect of two properties owned by the then group which were subsequently leased back to the group from the date of acquisition on finance lease terms.
As a result of the acquisition cash deposits totalling 111.9 million held by Indural as security for the groups finance leases were released from charge.
Indural has been consolidated in the accounts of the group from the date of acquisition, the effect of which has been that finance lease receivables and payables totalling 102.1 million have been offset.
The consideration payable on acquisition, together with an adjustment to the carrying value of the finance lease obligation, have been treated as a charge required to restructure the finance leases and shown as a component within interest payable finance lease charges for the year ended 30 June 2002, totalling 4.1 million Note 5.
13 The groups obligations under certain finance leases are secured by first-ranking fixed and floating charges over the property which is the subject of those finance leases and over certain cash deposits Note 26.
The weighted average rate of interest implicit in the groups finance leases is 6.5%.

In January 2003, upon redemption of the D notes issued by CWF Note 17 1, the associated interest cap was closed out realising a gain of 785,000.
This was offset against the write-off of unamortised fees allocated to the D notes of 2.3 million giving rise to a net write-off associated with the redemption of the D notes of 1.5 million.
Other than the above no gains or losses on derivative financial instruments have been recognised in the year.

The group also acquired the sub-leasehold interest with approximately 14 years now unexpired in 200 202 Aldersgate Street, a 440,000 sq ft office building in the City of London, and let the premises to Clifford Chance for a term of approximately 5 years at the same rent as that under the sub-lease.
Clifford Chance has given notice to terminate the lease on 29 September 2003.
The group will now seek to sublet the premises or dispose of its interest on the open market.
In accordance with UK GAAP the group has recognised a provision for the estimated net liability under the lease of 200 202 Aldersgate Street.
In arriving at the quantum of the provision the directors have consulted with FPDSavills, the groups valuers, to determine the assumptions on which the provision should be computed, including such matters as the void period, the rent achievable on re-letting and the incentive package payable.
Based on the valuers assessment of the market at 30 June 2003 a provision of 123.5 million has been recognised which includes an allowance for refurbishment of the building prior to re-letting.
This provision is based on the following key assumptions which will be reviewed at each subsequent balance sheet date: Passing rent 16.7 million 38 per sq ft Average void period 2 years Rent free period on reletting 2 years Headline rent on reletting 35 per sq ft Refurbishment cost 55 per sq ft This provision is stated at present value calculated on the basis of a discount rate of 6.0%, being the groups weighted average cost of debt, and will be amortised to the profit and loss account, after allowing for the unwind of the discount, on a straight line basis over the period to the first open market rent review on 10 Upper Bank Street in 2013.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :83 Other lease commitments: In March 2001 Lehman Brothers signed an agreement for lease in respect of 25-30 Bank Street HQ2, comprising 1,023,300 sq ft.
The agreement for lease requires that HQ2 be delivered in a fitted out condition and provides for payment of a fit-out contribution which covers, inter alia, the cost of fitting out the space to Category A Minimum Standard Developers Finish budgeted at a cost of 35 per sq ft which for accounting purposes is treated as part of the cost of the building.
The incentive package agreed with Lehman Brothers also includes the following additional elements: 1 a contribution to the tenants final fitting-out costs, equivalent to 30 per sq ft. Any fitting-out expenditure in excess of this amount is at Lehman Brothers cost: 2 payments to Lehman Brothers of approximately 16 million on drawdown of the HQ2 lease, equivalent to 16 per sq ft: and 3 a contribution of 30 per sq ft towards the cost of refitting the 408,728 sq ft occupied by Lehman Brothers at Broadgate, capped at 12 million, equivalent to 12 per sq ft of space in HQ2.
In total, these committed payments to Lehman Brothers, excluding the Category A element of the fit-out which is part of the cost of the building, amount to approximately 58 million, or 58 per sq ft.
Component 1 of the incentive package is taken into account in determining the market value of the building at 30 June 2003.
Components 2 and 3, totalling approximately 28 million, have been accrued for at 30 June 2003 reflecting the fact that HQ2 reached base building practical completion subsequent to the year end removing any conditionality to these payments.
Lehman Brothers has been granted options to sub-let back to the group up to 202,800 sq ft and in the event such options are exercised incentives totalling 65 per sq ft will be repaid to the group in respect of the space sub-let Note 26.
The group has also entered into a rent support commitment with Lehman Brothers under which the group may contribute a maximum of 10 per sq ft per annum towards the difference between the passing rent payable by Lehman Brothers on its leases at Broadgate and the rent achievable on any sub-lease.
For 1 and 2 Broadgate, comprising 311,077 sq ft where the leases expire in January 2017 and the passing rent is 46.86, rent support is only payable for the life of the first sub-lease: for the remaining space in 6 Broadgate, comprising 97,651 sq ft where the leases expire in September 2013, rent support of up to 5 per sq ft is payable by the group on any second sub-letting, but no further amount is payable thereafter.
The passing rent on the space in 6 Broadgate varies between 44 per sq ft and 52 per sq ft but on the majority of space it is in the range of 44-45 per sq ft.
The terms of the Lehman Brothers leases prevent it from sub-letting space below market levels and no amount is payable by the group on space which Lehman Brothers does not sub-let.
Absent any sub-lettings the maximum potential liability would have been 51 million nominal with a present value of 37 million discounting at 6%, being the groups weighted average cost of debt.
To date Lehman Brothers have sub-let approximately 100,303 sq ft in 1 and 2 Broadgate at a rent higher than the passing rent and therefore it will not be necessary to make any rent support contribution as a result of this sub-lease.
Accordingly, the maximum amount payable in respect of the remaining space leased by Lehman Brothers Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 84: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 at Broadgate has reduced to 38 million nominal with a present value of 27.3 million.
This amount has been provided in full at 30 June 2003 and, subject to review at each subsequent balance sheet date, will be amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period to the first open market rent review on 25-30 Bank Street in 2013.

If the group's investment properties had been sold at the balance sheet date at the amounts stated in Note 11, the amount of tax payable by the group would have been in the region of 125.8 million after taking into account available tax losses and provisions.
This amount comprises corporation tax on chargeable gains in relation to the sale of completed properties held by group investment companies of 45.5 million and corporation tax on development surpluses in relation to the completed properties that are held by group property development companies of 80.3 million.
Capital losses have reduced tax on chargeable gains by 128.0 million 30 June 2002 Nil and revenue losses have reduced tax on development surpluses by 200.0 million 30 June 2002 130.5 million.
In line with FRS 19, the benefit of these losses has not been recognised in deferred tax provided in the balance sheet.

The benefit of the capital losses has been recognised by reducing the contingent capital gains tax liability as disclosed above.

These warrants are exercisable until 31 December 2005 at a price of 375 pence per share and 1 April 2006 at a price of 275 pence per share respectively as adjusted see below.
The subscription price and the number of shares of both issues of warrants are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, such as capitalisation, rights issues or takeover.
Adjustment to Warrants The warrant instrument relating to warrants over shares in the company exercisable initially at 330p per share the 1997 Warrants and the warrant instrument relating to warrants over shares initially exercisable at 450p per share the 1999 Warrants both require adjustment to be made in the event of a capital distribution being made by the company.
Payment of the special dividend in November 2002 was part of the companys return of capital programme and in accordance with the terms of the warrant instruments, as approved by the companys advisers, accordingly triggered adjustment to the warrants.
Details of these adjustments are set out below: 1997 Warrants Initial subscription price 330p Initial number 8,925,233 Current adjusted subscription price 275p Current number of warrants 10,710,279 1999 Warrants Initial subscription price 450p Initial number 26,867,000 Current adjusted subscription price 375p Current number of warrants 32,240,400 In the event of a capital distribution the subscription price for both sets of warrants is adjusted by multiplying the subscription price immediately prior to the capital distribution by a warrant price adjustment ratio which is calculated by using the formula set out below.
Warrant Price Adjustment Ratio A B A Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 86: Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2003 Where: A is the current market price of one share defined as the average closing price of the five dealing days immediately preceding the date on which the capital distribution is publicly announced as calculated from the Daily Official List : and B is the value of the capital distribution attributable to one share.
Consequently, in this formula A 388.10p the average of the Canary Wharf Group plc closing share price of the five dealing days immediately prior to 12 September 2002 : and B 64.27p being the value of the capital distribution attributable to one share.
The current subscription prices referred to above were obtained by applying these figures.
Both warrant instruments also contain provisions which provide for an increase to the number of shares for which a warrant holder is entitled to subscribe following an adjustment to the subscription price.
This increase is calculated by multiplying the number of warrants currently held by the ratio derived from the following fraction: Share Number Adjustment Ratio X Y Y Where: X is the subscription price immediately before the adjustment: and Y is the subscription price immediately after the adjustment.
Applying this formula the adjustment ratio for both sets of warrants was 0.2 which led to the current number of warrants as outlined above.
2 Share Options At 30 June 2003 options had been granted and remained outstanding over 14,243,708 ordinary shares adjusted to reflect the special dividend paid in November 2002, see below for detail under the companys share incentive plans.

Adjustment to Options Following payment of the special dividend in November 2002 an adjustment was made to options outstanding under the Canary Wharf Group plc 1997 Executive Share Option Plan.
This method of adjustment had the effect of reducing the option price and increasing the number of shares under option to provide an equivalent value to option holders.
The impact of this adjustment is reflected in the table below.

Barclays is entitled to lease back all such space for a term of 15 years or more in multiples of 5 years but it may at its option lease back up to 4 floors for a term of 10 years medium term space.
If Barclays exercises its options a fit-out contribution of 70 per sq ft will be reduced to 35 per sq ft on short term space and to 40 per sq ft on medium term space.
No contribution is payable on long term space.
The existence of these sub-let options has been taken into account in the market valuation of 1 Churchill Place at 30 June 2003.
