Treasury hedging activities: The group uses interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to interest rates arising on underlying debt and cash positions or probable future commitments and foreign exchange risks arising on foreign currency assets and borrowings, foreign currency forecasted transactions and the retranslation of overseas net investments.
All instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile on existing underlying exposures and probable future commitments in line with the groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are recognised as adjustments to the net interest charge over the term of the contracts.
Currency swap agreements and forward exchange contracts are retranslated at the rates ruling in the agreements and contracts.
Resulting gains or losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related borrowings or, where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Where used to hedge overseas net investments, gains or losses are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, with interest recorded in the profit and loss account.
Where derivatives used to manage interest rate risk or to hedge other anticipated cash flows are terminated before the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognised on a basis that matches the timing and accounting treatment of the underlying debt or hedged transaction.
When an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur or finance debt is terminated before maturity, any deferred gain or loss that has arisen on the related derivative is recognised in the profit and loss account, together with any gain or loss on the terminated item.
Comparative figures Where the presentation of the financial statements and notes has been revised, prior year amounts have been reclassified in line with the revised presentation.
The profit and loss account, balance sheet and notes 2, 3, 5, 13, 14, 17 and 28 are affected by this change.

b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The differences between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 2003 2002 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 778 719 Less: share of joint ventures and associates profit before tax 44 31 Group profit on ordinary activities before tax 734 688 Tax on group profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2002: 30% 220 207 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including goodwill amortisation 48 51 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 23 7 Utilisation of tax losses and other short term timing differences 25 82 Deferred petroleum revenue tax relief 39 55 Higher tax rates on overseas earnings 5 6 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years 6 16 Supplementary charge applicable to upstream profits 47 12 Overseas losses or taxation not available for credit 17 Group current tax charge for the year 285 179 c Factors that may affect future tax charges The group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30%.
A supplementary charge of 10% is also currently applicable on the groups UK upstream profits.
Fair values are attributed to fixed assets on acquisition of businesses and companies and amortisation or depreciation is subsequently provided based upon those amounts.
Were the assets to be sold at the book values at the balance sheet date without the benefit of tax planning arrangements, the amount of tax that would be payable is estimated in aggregate to be 180 million 2002: 168 million of which 121 million 2002: 146 million is provided as a deferred tax liability.
There is, however, no intention to sell any of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the crystallisation of the above tax charge is considered to be remote.

9 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings for the year of 500 million 2002: 478 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 4,235 million 2002: 4,181 million.
The number of shares excluded 26 million ordinary shares 2002: 27 million, being the weighted average number of the companys own shares recorded on the group balance sheet during the year in accordance with UITF Abstract 13 ESOP Trusts.
The directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for goodwill amortisation and exceptional charges assists with understanding the underlying performance of the group.

Details of the revisions are provided below: Direct Energy Services Inc The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Direct Energy Services Inc has increased by 10 million to 203 million as a result of: a reduction in tangible fixed assets of 7 million to 220 million following final determination of the depreciated replacement cost: an increase in net current liabilities of 9 million to 13 million following final determination of debtor recoverable amounts and liabilities arising at acquisition: a decrease in provisions of 13 million to 31 million following final determination of deferred tax at acquisition: and increased consideration of 7 million to 445 million relating to the costs of the acquisition.
Electricity Direct The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Electricity Direct has increased by 12 million to 92 million as a result of: a reduction in debtors amounts falling due within one year of 17 million to 32 million following final determination of the recoverable amounts at acquisition: and increased creditors amounts falling due within one year of 7 million to 62 million following final determination of liabilities at the date of acquisition.
On the acquisition of Electricity Direct, consideration of 12 million was paid but held in escrow, contingent upon verification of certain working capital balances acquired.
Following verification, an amount of 12 million was repaid to the group.
Centrica Storage The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Rough storage has remained unchanged at nil, however the following adjustments were made to the fair values at acquisition: a reduction in tangible fixed assets by 18 million to 445 million following final determination of the value in use: a reduction in creditors amounts falling due within one year by 2 million to 16 million: a reduction in provisions of 17 million to 140 million following identification of certain non-qualifying deferred tax assets during the completion period: and increased consideration of 1 million to 489 million relating to the costs of the acquisition.
WTU CPL The goodwill arising on the acquisition of WTU CPL has increased by 18 million to 185 million as a result of: a reduction in debtors amounts falling due within one year of 19 million to 84 million following final determination of the recoverable amounts at acquisition: a reduction in creditors amounts falling due after more than one year of 17 million to 23 million following final determination of liabilities arising at acquisition: and an increase in contingent consideration of 16 million to 17 million to reflect expectations at 31 December 2003.
Contingent consideration is dependent on business performance to 2006 and is stated net of an amount recoverable from the vendor in relation to the liability for regulatory clawback, dependent upon the retention of customers above specific levels in 2002 and 2003.

Centrica plc report 2003 55 Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued iii Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of their useful lives.
The estimate has been based on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
The timing of decommissioning payments are dependent on the lives of the facilities but are anticipated to occur between 2005 and 2042.
The profit and loss charge includes 6 million of notional interest 2002: 4 million.
iv The provision for tax on gas and oil activities has been calculated on a unit of production basis.
v This provision included the difference between charges to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the pension schemes in respect of retirement pensions and other related benefits note 25. vi The provision represented costs relating to surplus properties, redundancy and other costs relating to reorganisations.
The provision relating to surplus properties was calculated as the lower of the difference between rental costs and sub-let income over the remainder of the leases and the potential cost to surrender those leases.
The provision for redundancy costs reflected announced restructuring plans.
The majority of these sums are expected to be spent between 2004 and 2005. vii The sales contract loss provision represented the net present cost, using a risk free discount rate, of expected losses on long term sales contracts, which at inception are onerous, based on the difference between contracted sales prices and the expected weighted average cost of gas.
These contracts terminate between 2005 and 2006.
The profit and loss charge represents 14 million of notional interest 2002: 14 million.
In previous years, the group renegotiated certain long term Take or Pay contracts which would have resulted in commitments to pay for gas that would be excess to requirements and or at prices above likely market rates.
The provision represented the net present cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the renegotiations, which are due for settlement in 2008. viii Other provisions principally cover estimated liabilities in respect of claims reflected in the groups insurance subsidiaries, outstanding litigation and provision for National Insurance payable in respect of long term incentive scheme liabilities.
The National Insurance provision was based on a share price of 211 pence at 31 December 2003 2002: 171 pence.

25 Pensions Substantially all of the groups UK employees at 31 December 2003 were members of one of the four main schemes in the group: the Centrica pension scheme formerly the Centrica staff pension scheme, the Centrica engineers pension scheme, the Centrica management pension scheme and the AA staff pension scheme.
These schemes are defined benefit schemes and are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The Centrica unapproved pension scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees whose benefits under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the earnings cap.
Independent actuarial valuations for SSAP 24 purposes at 31 March 2001 showed aggregate actuarial asset values and those values relative to benefits due to members, calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and services on an ongoing basis using the projected unit method as follows: Asset values Asset relative to values liabilities m % Centrica pension scheme 713 105 Centrica engineers pension scheme 396 106 Centrica management pension scheme 254 115 AA staff pension scheme 676 117 The long term assumptions applied to calculate group pension costs, 2003 2002 as agreed with the independent actuary, are set out below: % % Rate of price inflation and pension increases 2.50 2.50 Annual rate of return on investments 6.70 6.70 Future increases in employee earnings 4.50 4.50 Dividend growth 3.75 3.75 62 Centrica plc report 2003 25 Pensions continued The groups pension costs arising and the reconciliation to the 2003 2002 balance sheet provision was as follows: m m Regular pension costs 105 95 Amortisation of surplus 21 21 84 74 Interest 10 10 Net pension costs 74 64 Contributions paid 124 107 Decrease in provision for pension costs 50 43 Pension provision at 1 January 55 98 Pension provision at 31 December 5 55 i AA post retirement private medical insurance 24 21 ii Direct Energy Marketing Limited post retirement benefits 1 1 Pension and other retirement benefits provision note 18 30 75 Other retirement benefits i The group has a commitment to provide post retirement private medical insurance cover for certain AA current and past employees.
The triennial independent actuarial valuation undertaken at 31 December 2001, assuming a 2.5% per annum real increase in premiums, disclosed a liability of 27 million.
The provision under this scheme as recognised under SSAP 24 was 24 million 2002: 21 million.
The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was 3 million 2002: 3 million.
ii The group has a commitment to provide certain pension and other post retirement benefits to employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited Canada.
The Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan was established on 1 March 2002 and an independent actuarial valuation carried out on 7 May 2002, which disclosed a surplus in respect of pension benefits of 6 million and a deficit in respect of non-pension post retirement benefits of 4 million, resulting in a net surplus of 2 million.
The provision under this scheme as recognised under SSAP 24 was 1 million 2002: 1 million surplus.
The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was 2 million 2002: 1 million.
The total net cost to the group of other retirement benefits on a SSAP 24 basis was 5 million 2002: 4 million.
Additional disclosures regarding the groups defined benefit pension schemes, the unapproved pension arrangement and the post retirement medical plan are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The disclosures provide information which will be necessary for the full implementation of FRS 17 in due course.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March 2001, the unapproved pension scheme at 6 April 2002, the Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan at 7 May 2002 and the post retirement medical liability at 31 December 2001.
These have been updated to 31 December 2003 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at market value.

Had FRS 17 been implemented in full at that date the net assets of the group would have been reduced by 720 million 2002: 507 million, and the net charge for pension costs in the profit and loss account would have increased by 71 million 2002: 47million compared with that under SSAP 24, as set out below: Increase FRS 17 SSAP 24 Increase FRS 17 SSAP 24 decrease 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 For the year ended 31 December m m m m m m Amount charged to operating profit 138 79 59 133 68 65 Amount charged credited to interest 12 12 18 18 Net charge to profit and loss account 150 79 71 115 68 47 2003 2002 Analysis of the amount that would have been charged to operating profit under FRS 17 m m Current service cost 135 131 Past service cost 3 2 2003 2002 Analysis of the amount that would have been charged credited to interest under FRS 17 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 149 170 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 161 152 Analysis of the actuarial loss that would have been recognised in the statement 2003 2002 of total recognised gains and losses m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 208 588 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 3 3 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 419 99 Actuarial loss to be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses before adjustment for tax 214 492 History of experience gains and losses 2003 2002 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 208 588 Percentage of scheme assets 8.8% 31.2% Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 3 3 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities 0.1% 0.1% Total actuarial loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount m 214 492 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities 6.2% 18.1% 64 Centrica plc report 2003 25 Pensions continued 2003 2002 The movement in deficit during the year under FRS 17 would have been: m m Deficit in schemes at beginning of year 831 333 Movements in the year to 31 December: Current service cost 135 131 Past service cost 3 2 Employer contributions 124 107 Interest 12 18 Acquisition of surplus in year 2 Actuarial loss 214 492 Deficit in schemes at end of year 1,071 831 26 Commitments and contingencies a Acquisitions On 10 December 2002 the group reached agreement to acquire the retail gas and electricity supply business of the ATCO Group in Alberta, Canada for consideration of approximately 52 million, payable over two years.

c Decommissioning costs The company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide security to BG International Limited, which, as original licence holder for the Morecambe gas fields, will have exposure to decommissioning costs relating to the Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully discharged by the group.
The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields falls below 150% of the estimated cost of such decommissioning.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force unless and until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant Department of Trade and Industry decommissioning notice in respect of the Morecambe gas fields has been revoked.

e Litigation The group has a number of outstanding disputes arising out of its normal activities, for which provisions have been made, where appropriate, in accordance with FRS12.
f Guarantees and indemnities The company has 915 million of bilateral credit facilities 2002: 1 billion.
Hydrocarbon Resources Limited and British Gas Trading Limited have guaranteed, jointly and severally, to pay on demand any sum which the company does not pay in accordance with the facility agreements.
The group and BG Group plc have agreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify each other against certain actual and contingent liabilities associated with their respective businesses.
In relation to the sale and leaseback of the Morecambe gas field tangible fixed assets recorded in these financial statements, the group has given guarantees amounting to 60 million 2002: 92 million.
The group has given guarantees in connection with the finance lease obligations relating to Humber Power Limited referred to in note 12.
A fixed collateral payment amounting to 225 million 2002: 225 million is required in the event of Centrica plc failing to retain at least one credit rating which is not on credit watch above the BBB Baa1 level, and further collateral of 75 million 2002: 75 million is required if the credit rating falls further.
Centrica plc report 2003 65 Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Commitments and contingencies continued Group companies have given guarantees and indemnities, subject to certain limitations, to various counterparties in relation to wholesale energy trading and procurement activities, and to third parties in respect of gas production and energy transportation liabilities.
In connection with their energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in credit worthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
Following the closure of the British Gas Energy Centres Limited Energy Centres operations in July 1999, guarantees have been signed on certain former Energy Centres properties as a result of reassignment of leases.
g Gas purchase contracts The group is contracted to purchase 76 billion therms of gas 2002: 65 billion therms in Britain under long term contracts.
The significant increase on last year is largely due to the addition of a contract agreed in 2002 with Statoil to procure 17 billion therms over 10 years from 1 July 2005.
Last year this contract was not included in the numbers below as it was conditional, however during 2003 it became unconditional.
The gas contract commitments include several contracts with prices linked to the market price for gas and legacy contracts at prices, mainly determined by various baskets of indices including oil prices and general inflation, which may exceed market gas prices from time to time.
The total volume of gas to be taken under these long term contracts depends upon a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
Based upon the minimum volume of gas that the group is contracted to pay for in any year, the profile of the contract commitments is estimated as follows: 2003 2002 million million therms therms Within five years 43,500 45,900 After five years 32,400 19,200 75,900 65,100 The directors do not consider it feasible to estimate reliably the actual future cost of committed gas purchase as the groups weighted average cost of gas from these contracts is subject to a variety of indexation bases.
The groups average cost of gas from its contracts with third parties for the year ended 31 December 2003 was 20.8 pence per therm for the year ended 31 December 2002: 19.6 pence per therm.
2003 2002 The commitment profile on this same basis is set out below: m m Within one year 2,200 1,900 Between one and five years 6,800 7,000 After five years 6,700 3,800 15,700 12,700 As reported in 2002, the group entered into a contract with Gasunie to purchase an additional 27 billion therms over 10 years from 1 April 2005.
This contract remains conditional and is therefore not included in the numbers above.

ii Fair values have been determined by reference to closing exchange rates at 31 December.
iii Prior year amounts include C$500 million 196 million Canadian dollar bonds previously classified as loan notes.
iv The fair values of energy derivatives are calculated as the product of the volume and the difference between their strike or traded price and the corresponding market prices.
The market price is based upon the corresponding closing price of that market.
Where there is no organised market and or the market is illiquid, the market price is based upon management estimates, taking into consideration all relevant current market and economic factors.
Energy derivatives held for trading includes both physical and financial energy contracts entered into for trading purposes.
Prior year amounts have been restated to include the fair value of physical energy trading contracts as explained in note 28f.
v The fair values of these financial instruments are based upon discounted cash flows, using discount rates based upon the groups cost of borrowing.
vi Fair values have been determined by reference to closing prices at 31 December.
Centrica plc report 2003 69 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial instruments continued f Gains and losses on financial instruments held for trading The group engages in swaps, futures, forwards and options in gas, electricity and weather, for trading purposes.
Financial and physical trading positions are marked to market using externally derived market prices and any gain or loss arising is recognised in the profit and loss account.
This is not in accordance with the general provisions of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, which requires that these contracts be stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value or that, if revalued, any revaluation difference be taken to a revaluation reserve.
However, the directors consider these requirements would fail to provide a true and fair view since the marketability of energy trading contracts enables decisions to be taken continually whether to hold or sell them.
Accordingly the measure of profit in any period is properly made by reference to market values.
The effect of this departure from the historical cost convention on the financial statements for the year is an increase in profit for the year amounting to 5 million 2002: 7 million and an increase in net assets at 31 December 2003 of 14 million 2002: 9 million.
Energy derivatives held for trading include both physical and financial energy contracts entered into for trading purposes.
Prior year amounts in note 28e have been restated to include the fair value of physical energy trading contracts amounting to a net liability of 22 million.
The net gain from trading in energy derivatives included in the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2003 is 17 million 2002: nil.
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading purposes at 31 December 2003 amounted to 125 million and 115 million respectively 2002: 94 million financial assets and 111 million financial liabilities.
The average fair value of instruments held during the year ended 31 December 2003 did not materially differ from the year end position.
g Gains and losses on hedges The group uses financial instruments to hedge its currency, interest, energy price and weather exposures.
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives used are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position itself is recorded therein.
