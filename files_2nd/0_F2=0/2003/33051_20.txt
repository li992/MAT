Such gains would only become taxable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief or offset existing capital losses.
The group does not expect any tax to become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of tax on gains arising from the revaluation of xed assets, as the group is not committed to disposal of these assets.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no dividends have been accrued.
Tax losses and other timing differences with a value of 20.9m have not been recognised as their use is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
Of the losses, 1.4m expires between 2004 and 2009.
Notes to the accounts 61 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 8 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share of 24.4p 25.4p, 37.9p is based on the weighted average of 736,968,849 736,441,256, 735,427,260 ordinary shares in issue during the year and profit for the financial year of 179.9m 187.4m, 278.8m.

Earnings per share is also calculated below, before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, since the Directors consider that this gives a useful indication of underlying performance.
The calculation of the diluted earnings per ordinary share of 24.4p 25.4p, 37.8p is based on the weighted average of 737,624,103 737,523,158, 737,709,825 ordinary shares and the profit after taxation of 179.9m 187.4m, 278.8m.

The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of Hanson was 200.0m nil.
After dividends of 84.5m nil the profit for the year was 115.5m nil.

The cost of sharesave plans, share options and the Long Term Incentive Plan, where awards are granted at a discount to the market price of the Companys shares, is charged to the profit and loss account.
As the Hanson Sharesave Scheme is a UK Inland Revenue approved savings related scheme, Hanson has taken advantage of the exemption from applying UITF 17 Employee Share Schemes.

Healthcare and obligations to employees relate to post-retirement health and benefit costs of current and retired employees and are described in note 29.
Environmental and reclamation provisions have been established to cover those situations where the group has either a legal or constructive obligation to remedy known exposures.
Reclamation provisions are expected to be utilised over the life of the relevant quarry.
Legal and insurance and other provisions relate to acquisitions, disposals and rationalisations both arising on acquisitions and provided for in current and prior years.
Legal and insurance, environmental and other provisions are expected to be utilised on a reducing basis over the next five years, depending in each case on the nature of the underlying obligation.
The above provisions include 137.7m 146.7m at December 31, 2003 in respect of the cost of resolving current and probable future claims against US subsidiaries for asbestos.
Where appropriate, environmental and reclamation provisions have been established after taking into account the opinions of suitably qualied and experienced consultants and after estimating the costs in line with current practice and standards.
The liabilities for deferred and other taxation provided were as follows: 2003 2002 m m Excess of capital allowances over depreciation 170.3 148.8 Short-term timing differences 134.7 36.6 Other timing differences 98.8 102.4 134.4 214.6 Accounting Policies Deferred Taxation page 51 outlines those categories for which no deferred tax is provided.
Notes to the accounts 67 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 18 Koppers liabilities Koppers environmental obligations and related costs relate to the former US chemical operations disposed of by Beazer PLC prior to its acquisition by Hanson in 1991.
Beazer and certain of its subsidiaries remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations.
During 1998 an agreement was signed under which the funding and risk of the environmental liabilities were underwritten by subsidiaries of two re-insurance companies, Centre Solutions and Swiss Re.
A one-off premium and related transaction costs totalling $275.0m was paid providing insurance cover of $800.0m in perpetuity after payment by the group of the first $100.0m of remediation costs arising since January 1, 1998.
The discounted liability is now recognised in provisions and a corresponding asset representing the amounts receivable is shown in prepayments.
These costs are payable, on a reducing basis.
The Company estimates that this insurance cover is sufficient to meet these costs.
Factors which could cause actual remediation costs to differ from these estimates include i unknown adverse conditions arising at sites: ii third party claims in excess of estimates: iii changes to regulatory requirements for remedial technology iv any other significant variations to assumptions made in support of these estimates.
The Koppers amounts due from insurers, as shown in prepayments, and liabilities transferred to insurers, as shown in provision for liabilities and charges, are as follows: 2003 2002 m m At January 1 199.5 205.8 Increase in prepayment liability due to unwinding of discount 12.4 16.0 Increase in prepayment liability due to reappraisal of liabilities 63.2 36.5 Decrease in prepayment liability due to settlements 52.6 38.1 Exchange movements 21.3 20.7 At December 31 201.2 199.5 The matched increase in the asset liability during 2003 recognises the possibility of increased claims in future years.
The insurance agreement provides cover in excess of projected liabilities.

The fair value adjustments for joint-ventures and associates includes 17.3m of goodwill arising on the transaction.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to net assets and liabilities will be reviewed based on additional information up to December 31, 2004.
The Directors do not anticipate that any net adjustments resulting from such reviews would have a material adverse effect on Hanson.
In respect of acquisitions in 2002, there were no material subsequent amendments to the preliminary allocations made.
Goodwill arising on current year acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes.
Disposals On January 3, 2003, the North American division sold its 50% interest in North Texas Cement to its joint-venture partner for 75.7m, together with its ready-mixed concrete operations in Texas on July 18, 2003 for 48.8m.
On November 12, 2003, the Continental Europe and Asia division disposed of its Singapore ready-mixed concrete division for 0.7m.

Of this, 4.4m 10.0m relates to former trading activities of the group.
Also outstanding were 118.8m 144.6m of surety bonds issued by USA insurance companies in respect of reclamation liabilities of 43.2m 44.3m and performance bonds of 64.9m 82.1m.
These have been provided primarily to public authorities.
Other surety bonds amount to 10.7m 18.2m.
The groups bankers have also issued letters of credit of 94.9m 86.9m, primarily relating to performance bonds and the deductible element of insurance programmes.
No guarantees are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
Existing and former subsidiaries, including subsidiaries not transferred pursuant to the Demergers, have engaged in businesses and activities, unrelated to the businesses and activities presently being carried on by the group, which give rise to bodily injury and property damage claims concerning environmental and health issues.
Claims and lawsuits have been led against these subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, relating to products incorporating asbestos, coal by-products and chemicals, in particular for the wood treating industry.
With regard to asbestos claims, various of the Companys US subsidiaries are defendants, typically with many other companies, in a number of lawsuits led in certain state and federal courts by claimants who allege that they have suffered bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products, the manufacture of which by such subsidiaries ceased, depending on the subsidiary involved, between 1973 and 1984.
Each of the Companys relevant US subsidiaries, together with its insurance carriers and outside counsel, review each asbestos claim that is pursued by the claimants.
In many cases the claimants are unable to demonstrate that any injury they have suffered resulted from exposure to the subsidiarys products, in which case their claim is generally dismissed without payment.
In those cases where a compensatable disease, exposure to the subsidiarys products and causation can be established, the subsidiary generally settles for amounts that reect the type of disease, the seriousness of the injury, the age of the claimant, the particular jurisdiction of the claim and the number and solvency of the other defendants.
Information regarding the movement in asbestos claimants in the year and the cost of resolution in the year is provided on pages 28 and 29 of the Annual Report and Form 20-F. At December 31, 2003, approximately 124,200 claimants were outstanding.
The amounts of compensation formally claimed in the cases initially led by these claimants vary but typically follow standard formulations that are used in various jurisdictions by various plaintiffs law rms.
Of the claimants outstanding as of December 31, 2003, Hanson estimates that approximately 47% do not specify a dollar claim for damages, approximately 42% claim an amount greater than US$25,000, approximately 6% specify an amount between US$1m and US$10m and approximately 3% specify an amount between US$10m and US$40m.
The remaining 2% claim various amounts, typically greater than specified amounts between US$50,000 and US$100,000.
Hanson is not aware of any claim specifying an amount greater than US$40m.
Hanson does not believe that the specic dollar amount mentioned in the claim is an accurate gauge of what relief, if any, the claimant may eventually recover from one of Hansons US subsidiaries, and most claimants fail to allocate their alleged claims of liability amongst the various named defendants.
Of the claimants whose cases were resolved during this period, approximately 70% were dismissed without payment.
The aggregate amounts paid in settlement and average settlement payments in any given period, together with related defence costs, have uctuated widely and are expected to continue to uctuate widely depending on the nature of the claims resolved including the proportion which are mass claims disease mix, number of other defendants and jurisdiction of claim.
74 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 27 Contingent liabilities continued Most of the subsidiaries involved with asbestos claims have had agreements with their respective insurance carriers regarding the defence and settlement of asbestos claims, the terms of which varied for each such subsidiary.
These insurance arrangements have resulted in the insurance companies having met substantially all of the amounts such subsidiaries have paid to date in settlements and defence costs.
The Company assumes, in establishing the provisions for asbestos costs referred to below, that the amounts received from insurers will decline signicantly over the next two years.
One of the Companys subsidiaries is involved in litigation proceedings in the state of California with its insurers, with a view to establishing whether or not substantially all of the primary cover available to that subsidiary has been exhausted and, to the extent that such cover has been exhausted, the amount of excess cover that is available to it.
Two other subsidiaries of the Company are seeking to increase the amount of insurance cover available and have initiated legal proceedings in the state of Pennsylvania.
The Companys approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable and estimable.
The costs of resolving possible claims are accounted for as contingent liabilities.
At present, based on detailed analysis and the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and estimable equate to approximately eight years of gross cost at current levels.
Whilst further claims are likely to be resolved beyond this eight year period, the associated costs of resolution are not able to be estimated and hence no provision has been made to cover these possible liabilities.
In total, the full year increase in the provision for future asbestos costs was US$125m, including a second half charge of US$20m, taking the gross provision to US$317m.
Offsetting this is approximately US$73m of remaining insurance cover.
Assumptions made relate to the number, disease mix and location of future claims, trends in dismissal rates, settlement and defence costs, resolution of all existing claims, time scale of resolution of new claims, the continued solvency of co-defendants and expected insurance recoveries.
In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provisions for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and as a result the provisions will be subject to potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and developments occur.
Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates and expectations include: i adverse trends in the ultimate number of asbestos claims led against the Companys US subsidiaries: ii increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to settlement costs, dismissal rates, legal fees and or judgment sizes: iii decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims as a result of adverse changes in the interpretation of insurance policies or the insolvency of insurers: iv the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the scope of potential claimants: v the impact of bankruptcies of other companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Companys US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws: vi the unpredictable aspects of the USA litigation process: vii adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Companys US subsidiaries, and viii potential legislative changes.
In light of such factors, the liability of the Companys US subsidiaries for resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current estimates and the impact of such claims might have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash ow.
However, assuming that current trends continue, the Company does not expect that the liability and costs associated with its asbestos claims will have such a material adverse effect and, even assuming a material deterioration in current trends, on the evidence available to it, the Company does not expect that such claims would impact the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
In addition to US asbestos claims, the Companys former and existing subsidiaries are subject from time to time to bodily injury and property damage claims and lawsuits, both on an individual and class action basis, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations.
Such claims and lawsuits relate primarily to former US chemical products and operations, in particular those relating to the wood treating and coal tar derivative industries: products and operations which are unrelated to the groups present business and activities.
In such cases where one of the Companys subsidiaries is involved, there are often several potential defendants named in the claim or lawsuit.
Since the Demergers no settlements have been paid by, or judgments rendered against, any of the Companys subsidiaries which have had or could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow in connection with any such claims or lawsuits.
In a number of instances, the claim or lawsuit against the subsidiary has not been pursued and has been dismissed.
With respect to those claims or lawsuits that have been or are being pursued, the subsidiary concerned generally believes itself to have had or to have meritorious defences and such claims and lawsuits have been and are being vigorously defended.
Insurance issues do arise on these claims and lawsuits, both in terms of settlement and defence coverage, the outcome of which can be uncertain.
In certain instances no insurance coverage may be available to the relevant subsidiary.
The insurance cover referred to in note 18 relating to the Koppers environmental obligations does not apply to the bodily injury claims and lawsuits described in this note, although it will address certain of the property damage claims.
Several of the Companys subsidiaries are subject to litigation in California courts arising out of sand dredging operations on submerged lands leased from the state of California.
The litigation involves allegations that these subsidiaries underpaid royalties due under the leases and that sand was dredged from state owned lands without authorisation.
The litigation includes claims by the state of California under California statutes providing for the recovery of treble damages and certain fines, penalties and attorney fees where the wrongful conduct involves false statements or conversion of state owned property.
A press release by the California Attorney General states that he is seeking damages of $200m, although the complaint actually led in court does not specify the amount of damages sought.
The Company believes the claims are largely based on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant leases and is aggressively defending the matter.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation, no assurances or predictions can be made on the outcome of this litigation.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are also the subject of a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and disposals.
The Company does not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation and in particular in the USA, where there is the added potential for punitive damage awards, there can be no guarantee that a settlement might have to be made by, or an unfavourable judgment may be rendered against, the Company or one of its subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow in connection with the above mentioned non-asbestos claims and lawsuits.
Notes to the accounts 75 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 27 Contingent liabilities continued In connection with the Demergers, each of the four companies into which the Company demerged its respective businesses agreed to indemnify the Company against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of the businesses transferred to it on its respective demerger while the Company agreed to indemnify each of these companies against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of all other businesses owned or previously owned by the Company including the businesses transferred to the other demerged companies.
Neither the Company nor any of its existing subsidiaries has incurred any liability in respect of a claim that related to the above-mentioned businesses demerged by the Company, any such liability being borne by the relevant demerged company without liability to the Company or any of its existing subsidiaries.
The Energy Group PLC, one of the demerged companies, was acquired by TXU Corp. in 1988.
In November 2002, TXU Corp. announced that several of TXU Corps UK subsidiaries had been placed under the administration process in the UK, including The Energy Group PLC.
The Energy Group PLC itself is therefore unlikely to be able to full its indemnification obligations to the Company and its existing subsidiaries if and when required.
The Company is, however, not aware of any claims against it or its subsidiaries that would give rise to an indemnity obligation on the part of The Energy Group PLC.

The benets provided by these plans are based primarily on years of credited service and final average pensionable pay as dened under the respective plan provisions.
The Company, together with the relevant trustees of the various dened benefit plans, has a policy of ongoing review of the investment guidelines of each of the plans.
During 2002 this resulted in a significant reallocation of equities to xed interest securities in the main UK scheme.
The UK dened benefit plans were closed to new employees joining the Company after July 2002 and a new dened contribution plan was put into place.
The current level of employer contributions to dened contribution plans ranges from 3-7% dependent on the level of employee contribution.
During 2003 the Company completed a comprehensive review of the funding policies of its main US and UK dened benefit plans which led to the Company adopting a policy of funding to the level of the accrued benefit obligation.
This level is higher than applicable statutory minimum funding levels.
The decision resulted in a return to Company contributions.
Initial contributions were 25.0m in the UK and $80.0m 49.0m in the USA.
In addition the Company made regular contributions into dened benefit plans of 7.6m principally in the USA, UK and Australia.
Hanson also participates in several multi-employer plans, principally in the USA, which provide dened benets to certain of the groups union employees.
Multi-employer plans are accounted for as dened contribution schemes, since it is not possible to isolate the individual components of the charge that relate to the group from the other employers that participate in the plans.
Contributions relating to multi-employer plans are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements.

Pension plans The group accounts for pensions under SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The objective of the standard is to spread pension costs systematically over the period for which benets are received from the employees services.
UK plans the pension charge in respect of UK dened benefit plans is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using, in general, the projected unit method.
Actuarial reviews are carried out every three years.
Past service surpluses and deficits are amortised over the average remaining working lifetimes of the current workers in the relevant plan.
US plans a complete valuation of each US plan is undertaken by independent qualied actuaries every year.
The pension charge for such plans is charged based upon actuarial calculations determined in accordance with US accounting standard SFAS 87 Employers accounting for pensions, as permitted under SSAP 24.
The pension charge in respect of dened contribution plans is approximate to the contributions made and accrued for the period.
The charge to the profit and loss account under SSAP 24 is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 P&L charge P&L charge P&L charge SSAP 24 charge m m m Dened benefit plans 20.0 6.4 4.1 Dened contribution plans including overseas plans 7.0 5.2 8.1 Multi-employer plans 4.3 6.3 6.8 Total pensions 31.3 5.1 10.8 The assumptions used for the most recent actuarial valuations carried out as at January 1, 2003 for the US plans and during 2001 for the principal UK plan by independent qualied actuaries are set out below.

The assessed value of these assets represented approximately 106.7% of the liabilities for benets that had accrued to members, allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
Other post-retirement benets Hanson provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benets, mainly in the USA, under plans to certain groups of its retired and active employees.
Hanson conforms with the provisions of the Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 6 Accounting for Post-Retirement Benets other than Pensions UITF6, which requires accrual of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benets.

The object of FRS 17 disclosures is to present the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans assets and liabilities at their fair value at the balance sheet date and to separate the charge for pensions benets accruing to employees in the period the details of investment returns.
The date of the most recent actuarial valuation of the principal UK plan is January 1, 2001.
The date of the most recent valuations of the US plans is January 1, 2003.
Qualied independent actuaries have updated these valuations to December 31, 2003, in order to calculate the funded status of the plans as at the year end.
Each of the dened benefit plans has independent trustees and some differentiating characteristics, and as a result there are a range of investment policies and parameters.
In practice however all of the major plans utilise some level of xed income securities ranging from 32.3% to 100% with the residual invested primarily in equities with a strong bias toward domestic equity markets.
In the UK the objective of the trustees in investing the assets of the plans is to provide returns from its investments in the form of both income and capital growth to enable the liability requirements of the plans to be met over their long-term future.
Account has been taken of the maturity proles of the plans in setting the investment strategy with a policy that investment of the assets within the plans is in xed interest and index-linked securities as a broad match for the pensioner liability.
Although the trustees do not believe that it is practicable to set targets for the expected return on investments over a particular time period, the asset allocation selected is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy whilst maintaining a prudent approach to meeting the plans liabilities.
In the USA the trustees investment policy is designed to maximise the total return on assets with a strong emphasis on preservation of capital in real terms.
Assets should participate in rising markets, with defensive action in declining markets expected to an even greater degree.
The total portfolio is expected to be less volatile than the market the majority of the time, although individual managers portfolios may be characterised by higher levels of volatility.
As a reection of the decline in capital markets during the period 2000-2002, the actuary reduced the net investment portfolio return assumption from 8.8% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2002 and 2003 which is consistent with the return experience of the plans.
The major assumptions used to determine the liabilities on a FRS17 basis for the significant dened benefit plans as at December 31, 2003 are set out below: 2003 2003 2002 2002 2001 2001 United United United United United United Kingdom States Kingdom States Kingdom States % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of general increase in salaries 4.50 4.25 4.50 4.25 4.50 4.25 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.50 2.50 2.50 Discount rate applied to plan liabilities 5.40 6.25 5.50 6.75 5.80 7.25 Ination assumption 2.50 3.50 2.50 3.50 2.50 3.50 The expected rates of returns and market values of the assets of the principal dened benefit plans for the UK were as follows: 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 Expected Percentage Expected Percentage Expected Percentage long-term of market Market long-term of market Market long-term of market Market rate of return value value rate of return value value rate of return value value Market value of assets %% m %% m%% m Equities 7.5 40.4 465.3 7.5 40.3 421.2 8.4 64.7 751.6 Bonds 4.9 51.2 589.3 4.6 56.2 588.1 5.2 27.5 319.4 Other 4.0 8.4 96.2 4.0 3.5 36.9 4.0 7.8 90.1 Total 5.9 100.0 1,150.8 5.7 100.0 1,046.2 7.3 100.0 1,161.1 Present value of plan liabilities 1,187.4 1,146.3 989.3 deficit surplus in the plans 36.6 100.1 171.8 Surplus restriction 9.3 Pension deficit asset before deferred tax 36.6 100.1 162.5 Deferred tax 11.0 30.0 48.7 Net pension deficit asset 25.6 70.1 113.8 78 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 29 Pensions and other post-retirement benets continued The expected rates of returns and market values of the assets of the principal dened benefit plans for the USA were as follows: 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 Expected Percentage Expected Percentage Expected Percentage long-term of market Market long-term of market Market long-term of market Market rate of return value value rate of return value value rate of return value value Market value of assets %% m %% m%% m Equities 10.0 58.1 298.9 10.0 55.7 255.6 10.0 61.3 371.0 Bonds 6.5 32.3 166.4 6.5 43.6 199.9 7.0 35.0 211.4 Other 5.0 9.6 49.4 5.0 0.7 3.0 5.0 3.7 22.5 Total 8.4 100.0 514.7 8.4 100.0 458.5 8.8 100.0 604.9 Present value of plan liabilities 520.6 537.8 558.0 deficit surplus in the plans 5.9 79.3 46.9 Surplus restriction Pension deficit asset before deferred tax 5.9 79.3 46.9 Deferred tax 2.3 30.9 16.4 Net pension deficit asset 3.6 48.4 30.5 In addition, the post-retirement medical benets in the USA give rise to a FRS 17 liability before deferred tax of 71.3m 82.4m and after deferred tax of 43.5m 50.3m.

It also includes the principal amount of any forward exchange contracts and options undertaken to manage the translation exposure of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Fixed rate US dollar liabilities represent the $750.0m bond repayable on September 15, 2005 and $250.0m of the $750.0m bond due September 27, 2010.
The xed rate liabilities in Australian dollars, represent the net notional principal of interest rate swaps.
Interest rate swaps starting at dates in the future are included in the weighted average period, but excluded from the weighted average rate, in the table above.
Floating rate financial assets comprise cash deposits, the receivable element of forward exchange contracts and commercial paper.
The majority of oating rate financial assets and liabilities bear interest based on the equivalents of LIBOR.
The group has taken advantage of the FRS13 exemption to exclude debtors and creditors due within one year from this note.
Also excluded is the Koppers liability which is accounted for at a discount of 6.0% 6.75%.
These are all non interest bearing.

The effects of any interest rate hedges are recognised over the life of the hedge.
Foreign exchange hedges are evaluated against the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the resultant gain or loss is matched with that of the underlying asset or liability in the accounts.
As a result, the unrecognised gain or loss is a function of market rates at the balance sheet date and is not indicative of gains or losses which will be recognised in future accounting periods.

For long-term, traded xed rate financial liabilities, fair value is assessed by reference to the latest market price.
For currency swaps and interest rate swaps, fair value is estimated as the net present value of the future cash ows as implied by current yield curves.
Interest rate options are valued at market price.
Foreign exchange contracts, being generally short term in nature, are valued against the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
For debtors due after one year note 14 and provisions for liabilities and charges notes 17 and 18 fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value, and is not included in the table above.

Notes to the accounts 83 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 32 Subsequent events On February 10, 2004, Hanson announced that following a reorganisation within the group, the substantial part of the assets of Old Hanson had been transferred to the Company.
As a consequence, the liability of Old Hanson in respect of Old Hansons own public bond of US $750.0m, together with its guarantees in respect of the two US $750.0m bonds issued by subsidiaries, has been assumed by the Company.
During February 2004, the Company also assumed the obligations of Old Hanson under the revolving credit facility of 829.1m and the bilateral credit agreement of 200.0m referred to on page 27.
On February 16, 2004, Hanson announced the formation of a 50:50 joint-venture between Hanson Hong Kong and Anderson Asia Limited, a subsidiary of Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Limited.
Completion of the merger, which is subject to regulatory and other approvals, is anticipated to occur during the second quarter of 2004.
Other than the items noted above, there have been no significant events since December 31, 2003.
33 US accounting information a Comparison of UK and US accounting principles The groups accounts have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the USA US GAAP.
These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to profit for the financial year and shareholders equity that would be required under US GAAP is set out below.
Intangible assets Under UK GAAP prior to January 1, 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions was written off directly to reserves.
Since January 1, 1998, all acquired goodwill has been capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
On disposal of a business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after incorporating the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill, including any previously written off to reserves.
Under US GAAP prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001, was capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 40 years.
Under the transition provisions of SFAS142 Goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill which arose during the period subsequent to July 1, 2001 is capitalised, however, has not been amortised.
From January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
Under US GAAP, separately identied intangible assets arising on acquisitions are capitalised and amortised over their useful lives.
Under UK GAAP, these assets are included within goodwill.
Impairment of goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment where there is an indication that impairment may have occurred.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of goodwill for each income generating unit IGU with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill impairment test as required by SFAS 142.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair value.
Where the carrying value including any separately identied intangible assets is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill.
Where reporting units identied under US GAAP differ from IGUs identied under UK GAAP, a reconciling item may arise.
Employee Share Option Plans ESOPs Under UK GAAP, shares held by ESOPs are recorded as xed asset investments at cost.
Under US GAAP, these shares would be treated as treasury stock and deducted from shareholders equity.
Asset recognition Under UK GAAP contingent assets become recognisable in accordance with the criteria set out in Financial Reporting Standard 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
However, there are certain circumstances under US GAAP where an asset can only be recognised if additional criteria are met.
Pensions The cost of post-retirement benets is based on consistent percentages of employees pensionable pay as recommended by independent actuaries.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost or credit is determined by reference to the pension liability and the market value of the underlying plan assets, after adjustment to reect any previously unrecognised pension obligations or assets.
For certain pension plans the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2003 exceeded the fair value of related plan assets.
Where a pension plan has an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, US GAAP requires such amount to be recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
The adjustment resulting from the recognition of any such minimum liability, including the elimination of amounts previously recognised as a prepaid benefit cost, is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of unrecognised prior service cost with the remaining amount reported in comprehensive income.
Experience surpluses or deficiencies, which may result where the actual performance of the scheme differs from previous actuarial assumptions, are dealt with on an aggregate basis.
The group applies the 10% corridor test at the beginning of the year, to determine whether amortisation of the gain or loss is necessary.
Where the gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of the schemes assets, this is amortised over the active participants average remaining service periods.
The group also provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benets, mainly in the USA, under plans to certain groups of its retired and active employees.
The group conforms with the provisions of the UITF6 Accounting for post-retirement benets other than pensions, which require accruals of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benets.
UITF6 permits UK parent undertakings with US subsidiaries to adopt the cost of post-retirement benets calculated for SFAS106 Employers accounting for post-retirement benets other than pensions in their SSAP24 calculations under UK GAAP, therefore there is no reconciling item in respect of the groups US post-retirement benets.
84 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 33 US accounting information continued a Comparison of UK and US accounting principles continued Deferred tax Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, except those that relate to revaluations where no sale is in process, or where it is probable that rollover relief or losses will be applied to the gain, and also to the remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, except where no dividends have been accrued as receivable at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP deferred taxation liabilities are provided on all differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxation assets under US GAAP and UK GAAP are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realised.
Discontinued operations Discontinued operations are those clearly distinguishable operations and activities which either ceased or left the group in the accounting period or soon thereafter.
Under US GAAP, discontinued operations also include those held for sale, which are probable of completing within one year.
Acquisition accounting Both UK and US GAAP require that a deferred tax asset or liability be raised to reect the difference between the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and their fair values at the time of acquisition.
The recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities affects the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition.
Net income under US GAAP will differ from UK GAAP to the extent that the timing of reversal of the temporary differences acquired differs from the timing of goodwill amortisation.
Under UK GAAP, on acquisition, provisions for reorganisation costs are not included in the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, but are included in post-acquisition costs.
Certain reorganisation provisions under US GAAP are allowed to be included within the fair value at the time of acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, the inventories in acquired companies are valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, inventories are recognised at the time of acquisition on the basis of expected net sales proceeds, and are amortised over its period of use.
Under UK GAAP, when shares are issued as consideration for an acquisition, the acquisition price is based upon the share price at the date the acquisition is unconditional.
Under US GAAP, the acquisition price is based upon the share price over a reasonable period of time before and after the terms of the acquisition are agreed to and announced.
Joint-ventures and associates Operating profit, interest and taxation in respect of joint-ventures and associates are included in the accounts separately under each appropriate heading.
Under US GAAP, profit after tax of joint-ventures and associates are included on a single line within the profit and loss account.
The main adjustments that would have been necessary to reconcile the joint-ventures and associates not domiciled within the United States to US GAAP would have been in respect of deferred tax, pensions and goodwill.
The group has not included a reconciling item for these adjustments, as the effect on net income is not material.
Dividends Under UK GAAP, final ordinary dividends are provided in the year in respect of which they are proposed on the basis of recommendation by the directors, although this requires subsequent approval by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are provided for in the period for which they are declared by the directors.
Under US GAAP, dividends are not provided until the dividend is formally declared.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The group operates an Inland Revenue approved Sharesave Scheme open to all employees, which gives a 20% discount on the fair value of its shares.
Under UK GAAP no cost is recognised on awards under such a scheme.
Under US GAAP, the 20% discount should be expensed over the vesting period.
All plans from 2000 are impacted.
The group also operates two schemes which incorporate performance criteria, the Hanson Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under UK GAAP, the expense is recognised over the performance period, based on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria will be met.
Adjustments to the expense are made as estimates of the intrinsic value are updated.
Under US GAAP, the plans are treated as variable compensatory plans and the expense is based on the intrinsic value, remeasured at each balance sheet date and spread over the performance period.
Under US GAAP, the group applies the methodologies set out in APB25 Accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations, and is permitted to adopt the disclosure required by SFAS123 Accounting for stock-based compensation and as amended by SFAS148 Accounting for stock-based compensation transaction and disclosure.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities Hedging policy The group enters into derivative instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Under UK GAAP, these instruments are measured at cost and accounted for as hedges, whereby gains and losses are deferred until the underlying transaction occurs, as described in the accounting policies on page 52.
Under US GAAP, derivative instruments, whether designated as a hedge or not, are required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
As the group has elected not to adopt hedge accounting for the purposes of SFAS133 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, the reconciliation to net income fully reects the changes in fair value of the derivatives.
Transition adjustment In addition, under US GAAP, transition adjustments were required to include the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet on the adoption of SFAS133 at January 1, 2001.
For those derivatives considered as fair value hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening fair value of 17.1m was shown as current assets and liabilities derivatives and as an adjustment to debt.
The adjustment to debt is being subsequently amortised through the income statement over the residual life of the debt.
For those derivatives considered as cash ow hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening value of 0.5m was shown as current assets and liabilities derivatives, and as an adjustment to other comprehensive income.
The amounts in other comprehensive income are recognised as adjustments to interest expense in future periods as the related cash ows are recognised.
Notes to the accounts 85 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 33 US accounting information continued a Comparison of UK and US accounting principles continued Foreign exchange gains and losses on disposals of businesses Under UK GAAP, cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses relating to disposals are adjusted within reserves.
Under US GAAP, these gains and losses are included in determining the profit or loss on disposal of the business.
Exceptional items Certain exceptional items are shown on the face of the profit and loss account after operating profit.
Under US GAAP these items would be classied as operating profit or expenses.
Non-monetary transactions Exchanges of assets that are similar in nature and that have a similar use in the same line of business are not regarded as transactions that generate revenue.
The cost of the new asset is based on the carrying value of the asset given up.
When dissimilar assets are exchanged, the transaction generates revenue.
The cost of the asset received is measured by its fair value, which is equivalent to the fair value of the asset given up adjusted by the amount of cash transferred.
Under UK GAAP, when investments in joint-ventures are exchanged for similar productive assets, the transaction is recorded at fair value.
Under US GAAP, the transaction is recorded at historical cost.
New US accounting standards and pronouncements not yet adopted In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB released Interpretation No 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46.
FIN 46 provides guidance on consolidation by primary beneciaries of variable interests in entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities.
This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest, or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional financial support.
FIN 46 requires certain additional disclosures, some of which are effective for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003.
In December 2003, the FASB published a revision to FIN 46 FIN 46-R to address certain FIN 46 implementation issues.
The effective dates and impact of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R are as follows: i For special purpose entities SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003, either the provisions of FIN 46 or FIN 46-R should be applied at the end of the first annual period ending after December 15, 2003: ii FIN 46-R should be adopted for non-SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003 at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004: iii The provisions of FIN 46 are applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after January 31, 2003.
The group is required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R for periods ending after March 15, 2004.
The adoption of the provisions applicable to SPEs and all other variable interests obtained after January 31, 2003 had no impact on the groups financial statements.
The group has identied a variable interest entity in which Hanson is the primary beneciary.
This entity is Piedras y Arenas Baja, S fide R L fide CV Piedras, a 50% joint-venture which currently would be equity accounted for under US GAAP.
Piedras is an aggregates producer located in Mexico which in 2003 had turnover of 8.0m 5.1m and a pre-tax loss of 1.4m 3.4m.
In addition it had net assets at December 31, 2003 of 2.4m 8.4m.
Approximately 90% of the annual turnover of Piedras is to the group.
The groups maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement is approximately 16.9m.
The consolidation of Piedras is not expected to have a material impact on the group.

These statements differ, however, with regard to classication of items within them.
Under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents include short-term liquid resources but not overdrafts.
Under UK GAAP, cash ows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, dividends, management of liquid resources and nancing.
US GAAP, however, requires only three categories of cash ow activity to be reported: operating, investing and nancing.
Cash ows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance shown under UK GAAP, would be included as operating activities under US GAAP.
The payment of dividends would be included as a nancing activity under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, capitalised interest is treated as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates and thus included as part of investing cash ows: under UK GAAP all interest is treated as part of returns on investments and servicing of finance.

The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans.
As of December 31, 2003, the group gave consideration of the Acts changes to its retiree health benefit obligations by reducing the accumulated benefit obligation by approximately 12.4m for that portion of the benefit pertaining solely to prescription drugs.
This amount was reected in the actuarial gains of the roll forward of the accumulated benefit obligation for 2003.
The group has not recorded a benefit for this change in its net periodic benefit cost for 2003 but it expects to record additional income of approximately 1.8m per annum by amortising the unrecognised gain over the expected service lives of the active participants.
There is no specic authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy, but when issued, it could cause the group to change previously reported information.
Assumed health care trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post-retirement medical benefit plans.
A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on active and non active liabilities as at December 31, 2003: 1-percentage 1-percentage point point increase decrease m m Effect on total of service and interest cost components 0.4 0.9 Effect on post-retirement medical benefit obligation 6.5 12.5 The US plans assets are primarily included in the Hanson Building Materials America Inc.

i Additional information required by US GAAP in respect of accounting for the impairment of xed assets and for xed assets to be disposed of A summary of the impairment charges that have been recognised under US GAAP is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 m m m Assets to be disposed of 15.2 155.4 Assets to be held and used 72.8 937.4 72.8 952.6 155.4 Disclosed as: Impairment charges recognised under UK GAAP: Operating exceptional impairment charges 84.6 87.0 167.0 Non-operating exceptional provision for loss on disposal 15.2 Charge for the year under UK GAAP 84.6 102.2 167.0 Less: Adjustment to goodwill impairment recognised under US GAAP 11.8 58.1 11.6 Total charge before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 72.8 44.1 155.4 Add: Cumulative effect on adoption of SFAS 142 under US GAAP 908.5 72.8 952.6 155.4 Charged against: Intangible assets goodwill 26.5 924.7 90.5 Tangible assets 46.3 26.3 62.7 Trade creditors 1.6 2.2 72.8 952.6 155.4 During 2003 the Continental Europe and Asia division identied that certain of its operations contained goodwill with a carrying value that could not be covered by the projected cash ows of these businesses.
The full amount of this goodwill of 18.5m has been provisionally impaired pending completion of the impairment analysis in 2004.
Of the amounts charged as impairments in 2003 under UK GAAP, 30.3m 58.1m, 11.6m had been charged in prior years as amortisation under US GAAP or previously impaired under UK GAAP, and is therefore shown as a reduction in the difference between the charge under UK and US GAAP.
The operating exceptional charge of 84.6m in 2003 and 87.0m in 2002 under UK GAAP relates to various operations within North America and Asia Pacic, where it has been necessary to make an impairment provision for the difference in these operations carrying values compared to the higher of their value in use or net realisable value.
Of the 167.0m impairment charge recognised in 2001, 163.4m related to the continental European brick operations.
The company received a conditional offer for these operations, which indicated that these assets were impaired.
Accordingly, the directors recorded a charge of 163.4m to write down these net assets to their anticipated net realisable value.
In the year to December 31, 2001, the operations were included within the Hanson Building Materials Europe division and recorded a loss of 0.6m before tax.
The remaining 3.6m in 2001 relates to the anticipated disposal of the groups interest in certain Asia Pacic operations in the year to December 31, 2001, which contributed 0.7m to operating profit before tax.
The 908.5m goodwill impairment charge recognised as a result of the implementation of SFAS 142 in 2002 under US GAAP includes 142.1m in respect of Asia Pacic operations relating to Hong Kong, and reected managements reduced confidence in this divisions markets.
The SFAS 142 impairment charge also included 220.2m in respect of Hanson North Americas Aggregates operations and 546.2m which related to Hanson UKs Aggregates operations.
The SFAS 142 impairment charges recorded in respect of these two divisions arose as a result of the projected cash ows of these businesses being insufficient to cover the carrying value of the divisions net assets, including both preand post-1998 goodwill.
