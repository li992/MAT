Notes to the Accounts For the Year Ended 31 December 2003 1 Accounting Policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below and have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements under the acquisition method from the date of acquisition and those disposed of up to the date of disposal.
profit of Parent Company As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the parent Company is not presented as part of these accounts.
The parent Companys profit for the financial year amounted to 5,253,000 2002: 4,478,000.
Intangible Fixed Assets Publishing goodwill, comprising intellectual property rights on individual titles acquired, is valued at cost less provision for impairment and is written off on a straight line basis over 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net identiable assets and liabilities acquired and is then written off over its estimated useful life normally 20 years on a straight line basis.
The Board carries out a full impairment review on each acquired subsidiary or business after the first full year following its acquisition or where a change in circumstances warrants a further review.
Tangible Fixed Assets Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible xed assets in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold property 80 years Leasehold property over the remaining term of lease Plant and machinery 3 to 15 years Investments Investments held as xed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Those held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Investments held by the Company in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes materials and direct labour appropriate to the relevant stage of production.
Net realisable value is based on estimated sales price less all further costs to completion and all relevant marketing, selling and distribution costs.
Foreign Currencies Unhedged monetary assets and liabilities of UK companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling in the period in which the amounts 34 - Taylor & Francis Group plc Notes to the Accounts continued are transacted, unless matching forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, in which case the rate specified in the relevant contract is used.
Exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the opening net investment in the Groups foreign subsidiaries are taken to reserves as are exchange adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency borrowings used to fund the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries, to the extent that they can be matched with exchange adjustments in the relevant net equity investment.
All other exchange differences are reected in the profit and loss account.
Operating Leases Rental charges under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pension Costs The Group operates five main pension schemes.
In the UK the Group operates four schemes.
The first provides benets based on final pensionable pay the Final Salary Scheme and the other three provide benets on the basis of contributions made.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with insurance companies.
Contributions to the Final Salary Scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
Contributions to the remaining three schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are payable.
In the US the Group also operates a pension scheme, the benets of which are based on contributions made.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are payable.
Financial Instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All derivative instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk prole of an existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Any termination payments are taken to the profit and loss account.

10 Earnings Per Share Basic The basic earnings per share calculation is based on profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 16,773,000 2002: 13,677,000.
This profit on ordinary activities after taxation is then divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue less those non-vested shares held by an employee share ownership trust, which is 85,175,000 2002: 84,823,000.
Diluted The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the basic earnings per share calculation above except that the weighted average number of shares includes all dilutive options granted by the balance sheet date as if those options had been exercised on the first day of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted average of 85,770,000 2002: 85,697,000.
In accordance with FRS 14 the weighted average number of shares includes the estimated maximum number of shares payable to the vendors of Routledge Publishing Holdings Limited assuming that there are no claims for compensation by the Group that will reduce this deferred consideration and assuming that the Company does not exercise its option to pay the balance of deferred consideration in cash.
The deferred consideration shares are also assumed for the purposes of this calculation to have been issued on 1 January 2003 at the closing mid-market share price on 31 December 2003 of 509p, making 249,000 2002: 280,000 ordinary shares potentially issued.
Diluted normalised The diluted earnings per share normalised calculation has been made to allow shareholders to gain a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
It is based on the diluted earnings per share calculation above except profits are adjusted for goodwill amortisation and the after tax effect of exceptional items as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 profit on ordinary activities after taxation 16,773 13,677 Goodwill amortisation 9,776 7,251 Exceptional items after tax 2,775 2,182 Normalised profit on ordinary activities after taxation 29,324 23,110 40 - Taylor & Francis Group plc Notes to the Accounts continued The table below sets out the adjustments in respect of diluted potential ordinary shares: 2003 2002 No.

31 Contingent Liabilities The Company has guaranteed the overdrafts of certain of its UK subsidiaries, up to a combined maximum of 3 million.
The Company has also guaranteed 43,000 of loan notes outstanding and issued by its indirect subsidiary, Taylor & Francis Books Limited.
The Company has also guaranteed the lease commitments of certain of its US subsidiaries which amount annually to $255,000.
As at 31 December 2003 the Company has entered into forward exchange contracts for a total of $40.0 million to be converted into sterling, as follows during 2004: January 2004 $30.0 million @ $1.584 February 2004 $10.0 million @ $1.550 52 - Taylor & Francis Group plc Notes to the Accounts continued 32 Pension Schemes As explained in the accounting policies set out on page 35, in the UK the Group operates a pension scheme for eligible UK employees providing benets based on final pensionable pay the Scheme.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of contributions over employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualied actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation was at 30 September 2002, and does not take into account any impact of the general fall in stock markets since that date.
Any such impact will be reected in the next valuation.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the growth rate of the fund and the rates of increase in salaries.
A growth rate of 9% for the fund, a 6.5% salary increase per annum, an increase in pensions of 4.5% per annum and dividend growth of 5% per annum have been assumed.
The most recent actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the Schemes assets was 4,271,000 and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 66% of the benets that had accrued to members, assuming all members were to leave the Scheme at the valuation date with an entitlement to normal leaving service benefit.
The most recent actuarial valuation also showed that the deficit of the Schemes liabilities over assets on an on-going basis was 2,248,000.
In order to address this deficit an additional provision of 554,000 was made in 2002 to reect recent concerns about returns generated by equities, which form the largest part of the Scheme assets.
The pension charge in the profit and loss account before the additional provision of 554,000 in 2002 referred to above for the Scheme amounted to 241,000 2002: 353,000, which is not materially different from the regular pension cost.
As a result of the actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2002, the Company has increased contributions from 10.7% to 33.6% of pensionable salaries from 1 January 2004 until 30 September 2006 and 21.4% thereafter.
The Scheme is closed to new entrants and so this contribution rate is likely to increase as the membership ages.
The Group also operates three dened contribution schemes in the UK.
Contributions during the year were 370,000 2002: 283,000.
In the US the Group operates 2 pension schemes providing benets based on the value of contributions paid.
453,000 2002: 414,000 was paid in respect of the US dened contributions scheme.

The major assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: At 31 At 31 At 31 December December December 2003 2002 2001 Rate of increase in salaries 3.75% p. a.
Limited price indexation pension increases 2.75% p. a.
