Pension and post retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of pension and post retirement healthcare schemes throughout the world.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets of the schemes are largely held in separate trustee administered funds.
The UK funds represent approximately 80% of the overall pension liabilities of the Group and are closed to new members.
Full actuarial reviews of the UK funds were carried out during the year and agreement has been reached with the scheme trustees on funding for the next three years.
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 for the year ended 31 August 2003.
Additional information required under the transitional arrangements for the introduction of FRS 17 is set out below.
The Group intends to fully adopt the FRS 17 accounting standard for the year ending 31 August 2004.
SSAP 24 disclosures United Kingdom The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit UK schemes are reviewed regularly by an actuary.
A full assessment is undertaken every three years for funding purposes and the latest full actuarial valuation of the UK schemes was carried out as at 6 April 2003 by an independent actuary.
The valuation is based on a market value approach using the projected unit credit method.
The most important assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of increase in remuneration and the pension increase rate.
The funding position as at 6 April 2003 is used as the basis for SSAP 24 accounting purposes.
The main assumptions were a discount rate of 7.5% 2002: 7.5% per annum, remuneration increases of 4% 2002: 4.5% per annum for the Main Fund and 5.5% 2002: 4.5% per annum for the Executive Fund and pension increases of 3.2% 2002: 3.5% per annum.
The market value of the Main Fund was 1,129m 2002: 1,397m and the funding level was 107% 2002: 106%.
The market value of the Executive Fund was 325m 2002: 379m and the funding level was 81% 2002: 83%.
Overseas The Group operates defined benefit pension and post retirement medical benefit plans in several countries overseas, with the most significant being in the US and Canada.
The latest actuarial reviews of these plans were carried out as at 31 August 2002 by independent actuaries for the purpose of calculating pension costs for the year ended 31 August 2003.
The actuarial reviews of the US plans showed that the combined market value of pension plan assets was 151m at 31 August 2002 2001: 186m.
This represents approximately 105% 2001: 144% of the value of benefits that had accrued to pensioners, deferred pensioners and members as at that date.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the liabilities at 31 August 2002 were an assumed discount rate of 6.25% 2001: 7.25% per annum and earnings increases of 5% 2001: 5% per annum.
The actuarial reviews of the Canadian plans showed that the combined market value of pension plan assets was 113m at 31 August 2002 2001: 132m.
This represents approximately 95% 2001: 108% of the value of benefits that had accrued to pensioners, deferred pensioners and members as at that date.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the liabilities at 31 August 2002 were an assumed discount rate of 6.74% 2001: 6.94% per annum and earnings increases of 4.38% 2001: 4.98% per annum.

Mexican excise rebate The Mexican Supreme Court ruled in 2000 in favour of an action, brought by a number of spirits companies challenging the excise duty regime applicable to their Mexican operations during 1998 and 1999.
Its ruling determined that the tax was inequitable because it was applied only to large companies.
The Mexican Supreme Court awarded compensation which, by agreement with the Mexican tax authorities, was principally recovered by offset against current and future duties and taxes.
At 31 August 2003 the recovery was complete and 298m has been received over the past three financial years subject to applicable corporation tax at 35%.

Of the provisions outstanding at the year end, 3m relate to the final stages of the acquisition integration programme, 16m for the termination of a land lease in California and 4m for the trust fund established for social and community projects in Mexico.
The remainder relates to the QSR restructuring programme.
It is expected that the majority of reorganisation and restructuring costs will be incurred in the financial year ending 31 August 2004, whilst the trust funds will be disbursed as the projects develop.
The provision for surplus properties will be utilised over the terms of the leases to which the provisions relate.

Deferred tax has not been provided for liabilities which might arise on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates, as such earnings are reinvested by the Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
