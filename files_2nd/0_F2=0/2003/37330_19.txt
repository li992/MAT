Pensions The charge to profit and loss account for pension costs during the year is made up as follows: 2003 2002 m m Regular pension cost 3.2 3.1 Variations from regular cost 3.2 1.0 Other schemes 3.6 2.6 Net pension cost 10.0 6.7 The amount under other schemes includes the actual contributions paid to the Groups defined contribution schemes and sums paid to the BBC and BT schemes, as required under the terms of the participation agreements in those schemes, explained below.
Defined benefit scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is the only material defined benefit pension scheme of the Group.
The Scheme, which is closed to new entrants and which is non-contributory for employees, provides defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a self-administered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected unit method, as members approach retirement.
The last formal actuarial valuation, undertaken for the purposes of setting the ongoing contribution rate, was carried out as at 6 April 2001.
At valuation 6 April 2001 The key assumptions adopted for this valuation were as follows: % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.75 Discount rate prior to retirement 6.50 in retirement 5.50 Inflation 2.75 Actuarial value of assets % of market value 106.00 The valuation showed that there was a deficit of 1.2m.
The market value of the Schemes invested assets excluding the value of annuities purchased to provide certain pensions in payment as at 6 April 2001 was 60.8m.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 99% of the value of the Schemes liabilities at that date.
However, the situation has deteriorated since April 2001 as explained below.
The actuary recommended that the employer contribution rate be increased from 25% to 30% of pensionable salaries with effect from April 2001.
Employer contributions were paid at this rate during the year to 31 March 2003.
Employer contributions will continue at 30% of pensionable salaries until completion of the next formal valuation to be carried out no later than as at 1 July 2003.
The year to 31 March 2003 has been marked by further falls in the market value of equities and this has, in common with other UK pension schemes, resulted in a material deterioration of the funding position of the scheme and the deficit.
The impact of this change is reflected in the additional disclosures required under FRS17 shown below.
As a result of the decline in the funding position of the scheme since the last full actuarial valuation in April 2001, in March 2003 the Group made an additional one-off cash contribution of 7.5m together with the first payment of an additional annual contribution of 1.5m recommended by the schemes actuary.
The additional annual contributions will be subject to review in the light of future market conditions and valuations.
The 7.5m contribution is being amortised and charged to the profit and loss account over 10 years, the estimated remaining service life of the Schemes active members.
The pension charge for the current year reflects the amortisation and the initial 1.5m additional contribution as variations from regular cost.
Contributory money purchase scheme A contributory money purchase scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based staff, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based staff.
A further separate similar scheme, previously set up by Trillium, is also in operation for Land Securities Trillium staff.
Other schemes As part of the PRIME Agreement, the Group is obliged to provide pension benefits under a now closed funded defined benefit scheme applicable to less than 20 employees.
During the year the Group participated in the BBC pension scheme in respect of 168 employees who were transferred from the BBC to Land Securities Trillium Media Services Limited as part of Land Securities Trilliums outsourcing contracts with the BBC.
Separate pension arrangements have been set up for these employees with effect from 1 April 2003.
Land Securities Trillium Telecom Services Limited has put in place a defined benefit scheme with the same terms and conditions as the BT scheme for 333 staff who transferred from BT to the scheme from 1 May 2002.
All relevant pension costs are recharged to Telereal Services Limited.
There are also certain historic unfunded pensions being paid to three former directors of Land Securities PLC or their dependants in accordance with their service contracts.
All death-in-service and benefits for incapacity arising during employment provided by the Group are wholly insured.
No post-retirement benefits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.
LAND SECURITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2003 52 FINANCIALS Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2003 Additional disclosures under FRS17 Retirement Benefits As noted above, a full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken on 6 April 2001.
This valuation has been updated to 31 March 2003 for the purposes of the following additional disclosures required by the transitional provisions of FRS17.
The major assumptions used in this valuation, in nominal terms, were: 2003 2002 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.75 5.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 2.75 Discount rate 5.50 6.00 Inflation 2.50 2.75 Following the increased contributions made in March 2003, the pension fund deficit was estimated at some 18.6m in March 2003.

The consolidated balance sheet includes a net pension asset of 6.7m representing the unamortised balance of the 7.5m special contribution paid in March 2003.
A full adoption of FRS17 would result in the pension asset being replaced by the net pension liability of 13.0m, giving rise to a decrease in net assets of 19.7m.

FRS14 requires the post-tax effect of all changes in income or expense that would arise from conversions into dilutive potential ordinary shares to be taken into account in deriving earnings to be used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
For the year ended 31 March 2003, the convertible bonds have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because adjusting earnings by the loss on redemption results in the convertible bonds becoming accretive, rather than dilutive, to earnings per share.
In accordance with FRS14 Earnings per share, the earnings per share for the prior year have not been restated for the effects of the Groups Scheme of Arrangement referred to in Note 1.
Profits on the sales of fixed asset properties, bid costs and exceptional items comprising the deficit arising on the purchase and redemption of convertible bonds, cost of cancellation novation of interest rate swaps and the costs of reorganising the Group are excluded from adjusted earnings as these are non-recurring items.
The additional deferred tax arising from capital allowances on investment properties is also excluded as the Groups experience is that it is very unusual for plant allowances to be claimed back through balancing charges on the disposal of a property.
Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share have also been disclosed, therefore, to show measures of earnings that better reflect the principal operating activities of the Group.

As a result the development programme now includes: Developments which are completed but less than 95% let Developments on site Committed developments being projects which are approved and the building contract let Authorised developments Board approved projects for which the building contract has not yet been let Projects in these classifications are sufficiently firm to ensure that reporting from period to period provides a good basis for performance comparison.
Proposed developments are excluded from the development programme as experience has shown that these schemes can be subject to substantial revision.
However, the Group will continue to give an indication of the likely size and timing of these schemes and their potential impact on cash flow when discussing the development pipeline, which combines both the development programme and proposed schemes.
Developments are taken out of the development programme when physically complete and 95% let.
Schemes completed during the year comprise retail parks at Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Phase 1 of Almondvale, Livingston, Designer Outlet Mall, Livingston, Lakeside Retail Park, West Thurrock, a new unit at Markham Road, Chesterfield, Neptune Point, Cardiff and Bessemer Road, Welwyn Garden City.
In addition to the development programme, investment properties include properties to the value of 180.5m in respect of proposed developments.

Both the swap and the upfront fees are being written off over the life of the borrowings.
Either party to the swap can terminate the agreement on 15 April 2005 and every second anniversary thereafter.
The interest rate on the secured bank loan, which is variable, includes a margin which varies according to the Groups credit rating.
This has been swapped into a current fixed rate of 6.85%.
Secured loans are charged on properties of group undertakings.
From time to time, short term deposits are charged as temporary security until substitutions have been agreed for properties taken out of charge.
The bank loan is secured on the unitary charge receivable from the DWP under the PRIME Agreement and also on most properties held by Land Securities Trillium.
In May 2002 the Group put in place 1.5bn of additional bank facilities.
600m of these facilities were cancelled at the time of the issue of the 400m 5 7 8 per cent Bonds due 2013 and the 200m 6 3 8 per cent Bonds due 2024 and a further 100m of the facilities were cancelled in May 2003 shortly before their scheduled expiry date.

Financial assets and liabilities This note should be read in conjunction with the comments set out in the Financial Review on page 14.
The Group has defined financial assets and liabilities as those assets and liabilities of a financial nature, namely cash, investments, borrowings and interest rate swaps.
Short term debtors creditors, capital debtors creditors, taxation and prepayments and accruals have been excluded.
All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are sterling based and, with the exception of the committed bank facilities, at fixed rates.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities and their fair values are: Excess of fair value Book value Fair value over book value 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m m m Financial assets Short term investments and cash 102.1 72.3 102.1 72.3 Financial liabilities Debentures, bonds, other loans and overdrafts 2,688.7 1,767.2 3,204.9 2,205.6 516.2 438.4 Convertible bonds 243.3 274.9 31.6 Non-equity B shares 30.3 30.3 Redeemable preference shares 0.1 0.1 Financial instruments Interest rate swaps 82.3 4.9 82.3 4.9 2,617.0 1,938.2 3,215.5 2,413.1 598.5 474.9 Financial assets Financial liabilities 2003 2002 2003 2002 Weighted average period of fixed interest rates 1 day 3 days 13.3 years 14.1 years Weighted average interest rate 4.2% 3.0% 7.9% 8.3% Fair value has been calculated by taking the market value, where one is available, or using a discounted cash flow approach for those financial assets and liabilities that do not have a published market value.
The difference between book value and fair value will not result in any change to the cash outflows of the Group unless, at some stage in the future, borrowings are purchased in the market, or repaid, at a price different to the nominal value.
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps in the name of Land Securities PLC to hedge current and future interest rate risk.
In each case the Group pays a fixed rate of interest and receives six-month LIBOR.
The total notional value of the interest rate swaps is 900m all of which are now operational.
The end dates of these swaps range from March 2012 to September 2030 and the interest rates are from 5.00% to 5.58%.
In the case of four swaps, which have a total notional value of 400m and end dates of June 2022 and September 2030, the counterparties have the right to terminate the swaps mid-life.
Interest rate swaps with a notional value of 500m were entered into during June 2002 with a start date of March 2003 and an end date of March 2013 and interest rates ranging from 5.46% to 5.5%.
300m of these swaps were cancelled at the time of the February 2003 bond issues, resulting in an exceptional interest cost of 23.5m.
LAND SECURITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2003 63 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2003 30.
Financial assets and liabilities continued As the intention of these swaps is to fix the interest rates on existing and new borrowings, their mark to market values have not been incorporated into the financial statements and instead net interest is accrued through the profit and loss account.
In addition there is a further swap with a notional value of 198.4m which was taken out by Trillium to hedge the secured bank loan, referred to in Note 21, which funds the PRIME contract.
Either party to the transaction may terminate the swap on 15 April 2005 and every second anniversary thereafter.
This swap has a maximum life of 15 years and mirrors the repayment schedule for the associated bank loan.
As part of the fair value accounting exercise for the acquisition of Trillium, this swap was marked to market in November 2000 and a provision of 14.9m was established.
The provision is being amortised over the life of the swap as a credit to interest payable.
