Shares in Wilson Bowden Group Services plc and Ward Homes Group Limited acquired during the financial year are included at cost of 11.1m and 30.2m, respectively.
Shares in other subsidiary undertakings are recorded at the nominal value of the shares issued when each subsidiary undertaking was acquired.
With the exception of preference shares in Wilson Bowden Group Services plc, included at a cost of 3.0m, all shareholdings in these subsidiary undertakings are of ordinary shares.
Acquisitions On 17th April 2003 and 14th November 2003, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Henry Boot Homes Limited and Ward Homes Group Limited, respectively.
Following fair value adjustments, the resulting positive goodwill of 20.5m is being amortised over an average period of 4 years, on a straight line basis to coincide with the period which the acquired land bank is expected to be utilised.
The amortisation of goodwill has resulted in a charge for the period of 2.1m.
On 10th November 2003 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital Frenchay Developments Limited.
Following a fair value adjustment, negative goodwill arises as FRS 19 Deferred Tax does not permit recognition of deferred tax liabilities on an increase in stock values resulting from fair value adjustments.
The negative goodwill of 6.9m will be released to the profit and loss account to match legal completions on the land and the resultant tax liabilities.
No negative goodwill has been released during the year.

Borrowings and financial instruments The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings and other items arising directly from its trading operations which include long and short-term debtors, and long and short-term land, trade and other creditors.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following analyses.
The Group enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity, currency and interest rate risks.
i Liquidity risk The profile of the Groups borrowing facilities is representative of the nature of its activities, being a combination of medium and long-term projects.
On 4th September 2003, in line with the Groups policy to extend the average maturity of its facilities, the Group issued $100.0m of unsecured fixed interest rate loan notes at an average fixed interest rate of 5.6%.
On issue, swap arrangements were entered into to fix the principal amount of the loan notes at 62.0m and to fix the sterling interest payments relative to this amount as detailed below.
At the year end 63% of the Groups borrowings were due to mature after more than 5 years.
The average maturity of the committed facilities was 3.7 years.
The Groups policy is to monitor current and forecast gearing levels with borrowings normally remaining within the level of the committed facilities.
ii Interest rate risks As at 31st December 2003, the Company had entered into swap arrangements matching sterling interest rate payments with the swapped sterling balance of 62.0m as follows: Fixed rate Fixed rate Amount payable Maturity Amount payable Maturity m % m % 21.7 5.625 4.9.
2015 At 31st December 2003, 63% of the debt was at fixed rates.
The year end borrowings position was not typical due to the cyclical pattern of both housing and property development completion monies.
No interest is payable on long-term land creditors.
Bank borrowings are all unsecured with floating interest rates linked to money market rates: LIBOR, EBBR and base rate.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft and short-term committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
Floating rate financial assets are linked to UK base rate.
After taking into account swap arrangements, the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, which are all sterling balances, at 31st December was: Group Group 2003 2002 m m Floating rate financial assets 2.2 15.3 Financial assets on which no interest is paid 0.3 0.2 2.5 15.5 Floating rate financial liabilities 81.4 39.8 Fixed rate financial liabilities 141.6 79.9 Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid 24.6 34.6 Gross financial liabilities 247.6 154.3 Financial assets comprise cash at bank of 2.1m 2002: 2.3m, fixed asset investments of Nil 2002: 12.5m and long-term trade debtors of 0.4m 2002: 0.7m.
The weighted average interest rate for the fixed rate financial liabilities was 6.5% for 2003 2002: 7.2%, with, at 31st December 2003, a weighted average period of 7.9 years 2002: 7.1 years for which the rate is fixed.
The weighted average period until maturity of the financial liabilities on which no interest is paid is 2.4 years 2002: 2.2 years.
iii Currency exposure After taking into account currency swaps the Group had no currency exposure at 31st December 2003 2002: Nil.

40.0m of these notes are repayable in April 2009, 40.0m in October 2010, 43.4m in September 2013 and 18.6m in September 2015.
These notes carry interest at an average rate of 6.5% and are unsecured.
v Borrowing facilities The Group currently has sterling bank and other borrowing facilities amounting to 580.0m.
Committed facilities amount to 537.0m, of which 305.0m are available under short and medium-term committed lines.
All bank facilities are subject to floating interest rates linked to money market rates.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to the Group at 31st December, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, had the following spread of maturity: Group Group 2003 2002 m m Expiring in one year or less 32.5 45.0 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 105.0 95.0 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 177.4 125.0 314.9 265.0 vi Fair value of financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial liabilities: Group Group Group Group 2003 2003 2002 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term borrowings net of cash in hand 2.1m 2002: 2.3m 31.7 31.7 12.5 12.5 Medium-term borrowings 47.6 47.6 25.0 25.0 Long-term borrowings 141.6 143.1 79.9 85.4 Land creditors 24.6 24.6 34.6 34.6 Long-term debtors 0.4 0.4 0.7 0.7 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Swap arrangements 4.3 245.1 250.9 151.3 156.8 WB RA f ckd 2003 57 IBC 26 2 04 12:20 pm Page 67 17.
Borrowings and financial instruments continued Market values have been used to determine the fair value of swap arrangements.
The fair values of long-term borrowings have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
There is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Groups other financial assets and liabilities.
vii Gains and losses on financial liabilities held for hedging purposes The Groups policy is to hedge a proportion of interest rate risk using swap arrangements.
Gains and losses on swap arrangements are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur.
