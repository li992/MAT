Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation, L. P. In July 1999, Psion Teklogix and other leading members of the automatic identification and data capture industry initiated a joint legal action against Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation, L. P. in the state of Nevada, USA, claiming a declaratory judgement of the court that intellectual property rights asserted against certain customers of Psion Teklogix and the Industry Members by Lemelson Medical were invalid, unenforcable and were not infringed by the products of Psion Teklogix or the Industry Members, or by their customers use of such products.
During 2001 and 2002, Lemelson Medical instigated legal action against over 500 industrial companies in the United States, alleging that their use of Auto ID methods infringed Lemelson Medicals intellectual property rights.
Some of the companies against whom Lemelson Medical brought such an action were customers of Psion Teklogix.
On 23 January 2004, the United States District Court of Nevada found in favour of Psion Teklogix and the Industry Members, ruling that the intellectual property rights asserted by Lemelson Medical were invalid and unenforcable and were not infringed by Psion Teklogix or the Industry Members.
Lemelson Medical has the right to appeal against this judgement.
It is not possible to establish the quantum of Lemelson Medicals claim in the event that it successfully appeals against the judgement.
In light of the judgement and having taken legal advice, the Board is of the opinion that neither Psion Teklogixs products nor its customers use of them infringes any of Lemelson Medicals intellectual property rights, and the company intends to defend any appeal which may be brought by Lemelson Medical against the judgement of the District Court of Nevada.
No appeal by Lemelson Medical against the judgement has been lodged as at 1 March 2004.
On 4 February and 5 February 2004, Lemelson Medical filed with the District Court of Nevada two motions to amend the judgement in favour of Lemelson Medical, citing inconsistencies in the judgement.
Certain of Psion Teklogixs customers who are being sued by Lemelson Medical for their alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights have, in the past, sent correspondence to Psion Teklogix claiming indemnification from Psion Teklogix in respect of any sums they are required to pay to Lemelson Medical.
However, no legal action has been brought against Psion Teklogix in relation to such claims.
It is not possible to establish the quantum of the claims in the event that legal proceedings are instigated against Psion Teklogix in relation to the claims for indemnity.
Having taken legal advice, the Board is of the opinion that the claims by certain of Psion Teklogixs customers for indemnity would be successfully defended by Psion Teklogix and the company intends to defend any such actions should they be brought.
The claims against Psion Teklogixs customers by Lemelson Medical have been stayed pending the determination of the action between Lemelson Medical, Psion Teklogix and the Industry Members and the Board has received legal advice that, unless Lemelson Medical is successful in appealing against the judgement of the District Court of Nevada, such claims are unlikely to be resumed.
