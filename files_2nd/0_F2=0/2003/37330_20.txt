Properties, reserves and net assets per share reflect valuations of investment properties made by Knight Frank at each year end.
In 2002, however, reserves and net assets also include the Groups 50% share of Telereals revaluation surplus arising on the revaluation of its investment properties.
With the introduction of FRS3 effective for the year ended 31 March 1994, comparatives, where appropriate, have been restated.
2001 has been restated as appropriate, for prior year adjustments arising from the adoption of FRS19 and UITF28 which became effective for the year ended 31 March 2002 and the change in accounting policy to capitalise interest effective from 1 April 2000.
2001 and 2002 also reflect the change in accounting policy introduced in 2002 in response to the treatment of bid costs under UITF34 which became effective in 2003.
However, figures for 2000 and prior years have not been restated to reflect changes in accounting policies made in 2002.
