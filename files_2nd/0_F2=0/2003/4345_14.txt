15 Foreign currencies Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as hedges when they relate to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and which involves the same currency as the hedged item.

Exchange rate differences are charged to the profit and loss account.
16 Derivative instruments The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposures.
The Group considers that its derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met as set out below: Forward foreign currency contracts The criteria for forward foreign currency contracts are that the instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified, it must involve the same currency as the hedged item and it must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to hedge a committed or probable future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Interest rate swaps The Groups criteria for interest rate swaps are that the instrument must be related to an asset or a liability and it must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials are recognised by accruing the net interest payable.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown in the Groups balance sheet at the year end.
