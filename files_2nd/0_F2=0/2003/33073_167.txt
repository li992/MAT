Additional segmental information as required by US GAAP Segmental information is provided on the following pages in accordance with SFAS 131 on the basis of the product categories described on page 80.
Unilever has reviewed the extent of its business with major customers.
As a result, Unilever has concluded that it has no major customers that would require separate disclosure during the reporting periods covered by this ling.
For management reporting purposes, Unilever uses a number of measures of segment performance at constant average rates of exchange that is, the same rates as in the preceding year.
The internal management measure of profit which is most consistent with operating profit reported in the accounts is Trading Result.
This differs from operating profit, mainly because Trading Result includes a number of other adjustments, including the application of an ination charge on working capital which is added back to arrive at operating profit, and certain other statistical items.
Prior to 1 January 2003 these statistical items included the use of replacement cost depreciation of tangible xed assets.
In presenting results from 1 January 2003 this adjustment has been eliminated as financial depreciation is also used for internal management reporting purposes.
Prior years have been restated onto a comparable basis.
The change in internal management reporting has reduced depreciation in 2002 by 220 million and by 248 million in 2001.
