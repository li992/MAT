i Dened contribution plan Flexiplan The pension charge for the year for Flexiplan represents contributions due from the employer and amounted to 3.4m 2002 4.0m with 0.3m 2002 nil outstanding at the year end.
ii Dened benefit plan Emap Earnings Related Pension Plan EERPP The pension charge for the year for EERPP was 0.5m 2002 0.6m.
Contributions are assessed by a qualied actuary using the projected unit method and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the staffs estimated remaining service lives within the Group.
The balance sheet contains a prepayment amounting to 4.4m 2002 3.1m.
The pension cost for the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of an actuary.
For these purposes a valuation of the EERPP was carried out as at 5 April 2000 using the projected unit method.
In this valuation the assets were taken in at their market value of 87.5m.
A value was placed on the liabilities by discounting the anticipated future benets, including allowances for future increases in plan pay and pensions in payment, using assumptions derived by reference to market conditions as at 5 April 2000.
The principal assumptions adopted were that existing investments would return 3.1% per annum in real terms ahead of price ination assumed to be 3% per annum.
Furthermore, it was assumed that new investments would return 3.5% per annum in real terms, plan pay increases would exceed ination by 1.5% per annum and limited price indexation increases awarded to pension in payment would on average follow the rate of ination.
The results of the valuation for funding purposes undertaken at 5 April 2000 were that the assets were sufficient to cover 88% of the plans liabilities.
With effect from 5 April 2001, employer contributions were increased to 21.4% of Plan Pay plus 0.1m per month.
With effect from 5 April 2003 this has been amended to 21.4% of Plan Pay plus 0.2m per month.
iii FRS 17 disclosures Whilst SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs disclosure and measurement principles have been applied to pensions in these financial statements, the tables below set out the transitional disclosures required by FRS 17 Retirement benets for the current year in relation to the Emap Earnings Related Pension Plan EERPP and other overseas retirement arrangements.
All calculations have been made by a qualied independent actuary based on the most recent full actuarial valuation of the EERPP as at 5 April 2000 updated to 31 March 2003.

Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following disclosures.
a Borrowing facilities The Groups borrowing limit at 31 March 2003 calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association was 1,283m 2002 1,187m.
At 31 March 2003, the Group had a 650m syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility which matures in May 2006.
The Group had undrawn committed amounts under the 650m facility available at 31 March 2003 of 441m 2002 398m.
The Group also has short-term uncommitted credit facilities.
All of these facilities bear margins at market rates.
b Currency exposures The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have net monetary assets liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency at 31 March.
Net foreign exchange gains and losses arising on these assets liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account of the individual companies and the Group.

i Borrowings The maturity prole of borrowings is provided in Note 22.
The currency and interest rate prole of the Groups borrowings, taking into account the effect of interest rate and cross currency swaps, is as follows: Fixed rate borrowings Fixed rate weighted borrowings average weighted interest average rate at time for Non-interest 31 March which rate 1 2 3 Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total 2003 is xed Note m m m m % Years Sterling 65 4 4 65 8.0 1.3 Euros 54 118 172 5.2 2.5 At 31 March 2003 119 122 4 237 Bank loans 102 118 4 216 Loan notes 4 4 Owed to associated undertaking 31 17 17 At 31 March 2003 119 122 4 237 At 31 March 2002 128 183 5 306 1 Bank loans and amounts owed to associated undertakings bear interest at rates xed in advance for periods of up to six months by reference to LIBOR.
2 Fixed rate bank loans relate to oating rate borrowings swapped into xed rate for periods of between three and five years by using interest rate swaps.
3 Non-interest bearing borrowings comprise unamortised arrangement fees.
Arrangement fees are amortised and charged in the Consolidated profit and loss account evenly over the term of the related bank facility expiring in May 2006. ii Onerous operating leases Property provisions at 31 March 2003 of 4m relate to onerous operating lease commitments: see Note 23 a.
The maturity prole of these leases is 1m falling due within one year, 2m falling due between two and five years and 1m after more than five years.
These financial liabilities are considered to be oating rate financial liabilities.
This is because in establishing the provisions, the cash ows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the liability.
e Fair value of financial instruments The table below provides a comparison of the carrying values and fair values of the Groups financial assets liabilities where there is a material difference.
Where available, third party market values have been used to determine fair values, otherwise fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

As such, any change in the value of the hedge will be generally offset by a change in the value of the underlying asset or liability.

Valuations have been measured by reference to the greater of net realisable and value in use.
Value in use has been calculated by references to future expected cash ows, discounted at a rate of 11.3%.
The revaluation in the year relates to the revaluation of titles acquired as part of the dissolution of Hachette Emap Magazines Limited.
As a result of the dissolution the Group retained New Woman and Top Sant, making a payment to a subsidiary of Hachette Filipacchi Presse SA to compensate them for their 50% share of these titles.
The original 50% of these titles owned by Emap was revalued to current market value at the time of acquisition in October 2002. emap 63 Notes to the accounts continued 15 Tangible xed assets Long Short Ofce Freehold leasehold leasehold equipment property property property and vehicles Total m m m m m Cost At 1 April 2002 2 3 9 58 72 Exchange movements 2 2 Additions 16 16 Disposals 3 3 At 31 March 2003 2 3 9 73 87 Depreciation At 1 April 2002 5 38 43 Exchange movements 2 2 Provided during the year 2 10 12 Disposals 2 2 At 31 March 2003 7 48 55 Net book value at 31 March 2003 2 3 2 25 32 Net book value at 31 March 2002 2 3 4 20 29 16 Fixed asset investments Joint ventures and associated undertakings Shares a Loans b Total Notes m m m Cost At 1 April 2002 13 4 Transfer to Other xed asset investments 17 3 3 At 31 March 2003 11 Post acquisition reserves At 1 April 2002 2 2 Transfer to Other provisions 23 a 3 3 At 31 March 2003 11 Net book value at 31 March 2003 2 2 Net book value at 31 March 2002 1 3 2 There is no goodwill in relation to the above joint ventures and associated undertakings.
