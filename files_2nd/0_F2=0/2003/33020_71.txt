AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements 90 Form 20-F Information 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Group continues to account for pension costs in its primary Financial Statements in accordance with the UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
In addition, disclosures have been presented below in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution where the company contribution and resulting profit and loss account charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
All of the major plans are funded through legally separate trustee administered funds.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the Swedish plan, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
SSAP 24 The cost of defined benefit plan pensions in a year can notionally be divided into the regular cost and variations from the regular cost.
Under SSAP 24 the regular cost is based on actuarial assumptions and charged to the profit and loss account in the year it is incurred whilst any variations, which arise where the experience of the scheme varies from the assumptions made by the actuary, are charged or credited over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees.
Costs of defined contribution plan pensions are charged to the profit and loss account immediately.
On these bases, the total pension cost for the Group under SSAP 24 for 2003 was $272m 2002 $220m, 2001 $194m.
In the Group balance sheet at 31 December 2003, accrued pension costs included in other creditors amounted to $143m 2002 $53m : prepaid pension costs of $628m 2002 $268m are included in debtors.
Provisions for unfunded pension obligations, included in provisions, amounted to $283m 2002 $235m.
With regard to the Groups main UK defined benefit fund, the latest actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2003 and the pension cost assessed using the projected unit credit method.
The key accounting assumptions for the purposes of SSAP 24 were that, against a background of long term UK price inflation averaging 2.4% pa, investment returns would average 6.6% pa, salary increases 3.7% pa and pension increases 2.4% pa.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date was 2,043m $3,640m equivalent, representing 89.1% of the liabilities using these assumptions.
The cost for accounting purposes equates to 21.1% of pensionable salaries.
At the same time, the valuation was carried out for ongoing funding purposes, with assumptions slightly more conservative than those used for SSAP 24 purposes.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date represents 87.4% of the liabilities on a funding basis.
The Company had indicated to the trustee of the UK fund its intention to target a solvency ratio of 91% following the March 2003 actuarial valuation, and this has been exceeded with a $165m cash contribution in 2003.
At the time the contribution was made in November, the solvency ratio was 95%.
The longer term aim is to restore solvency over a period of around 15 years.
Any cash contributions made to the fund are treated as prepayments and taken into account in the actuarially assessed contributions to the fund charged to the profit and loss account.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2003 when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $925m and plan assets were $1,079m.
The US typically makes contributions to mitigate for plan benefit deficits on a regular basis.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2003 when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $440m and plan assets were $441m.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements Form 20-F Information 2003 91 29 Post-retirement benefits continued Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
Some 5,478 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 14,176 current employees will be eligible on retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2003 was $10m 2002 $22m, 2001 $16m.
Provisions and creditors set aside for the benefit obligations at 31 December 2003 amounted to $28m 2002 $32m, 2001 $248m.
Other than these provisions and creditors there were plan assets amounting to $194m in the US at 31 December 2003.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under FRS 17.
FRS 17 Full implementation of FRS 17 had originally been intended for accounting periods ending on or after 22 June 2003 but has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
However, the requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 between its issue and full implementation dates remain and this information is set out below.
When fully adopted, the objective of FRS 17 is to reflect the fair value of post-retirement plan assets and liabilities and associated charges in the Financial Statements.
FRS 17 specifies how key assumptions should be formulated and applied: these assumptions are often different to the funding bases established by the pension funds trustees or actuaries.
The accounting requirements of FRS 17 are broadly as follows: Post-retirement scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date: Post-retirement scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability: and The movement in the scheme surplus deficit excluding contributions will be split between operating charges and financing items in the profit and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2003.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long term nature of the scheme, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2003 2002 Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group Inflation assumption 2.6% 2.3% 2.2% 2.1% Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% 4.3% 4.0% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.6% 0.6% 2.2% 0.5% Discount rate 5.4% 5.3% 5.6% 5.8% Long term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 8.3% 8.7% 8.3% 8.4% Bonds 5.1% 5.8% 4.9% 6.1% Others 4.2% 3.9% 3.7% 3.6% AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements 92 Form 20-F Information 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Post-retirement benefits continued Post-retirement scheme deficit The post-retirement scheme deficit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard were fully applied.
However, under the current accounting methodology SSAP 24 there are prepayments and provisions including deferred tax within the balance sheet at 31 December 2003 that must be taken into account in calculating the effect on net assets of this deficit in the event of a restatement under FRS 17.
The assets and liabilities of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2003 as calculated in accordance with FRS 17 are shown below.
The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes liabilities is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain.
If FRS 17 had been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2003, the Groups reported net assets see page 64 would be reduced by $1,057m 7.9% to $12,200m.

This increase has been driven in part by the changes in financial assumptions detailed on page 91.
There has also been an adverse exchange effect of approximately $320m on these liabilities during the year.
