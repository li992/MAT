Capital allowances are claimed on eligible investment assets and calculated on the reducing balance.
The availability of further capital allowances will depend, inter alia, on the timing of the Groups development programme.
In addition where assets are sold out of the British Land Group the gain arising will initially be set off against capital losses and so such sales may reduce the tax rate.
Contingent tax The tax which would arise on the disposal of properties and investments at the amount at which they are carried in the balance sheet, and including trading and development surpluses, is estimated at 470m 2002: 510m after taking account of available losses and provisions.
Tax losses, which have not been recognised in the Balance Sheet, have reduced the contingent tax by approximately 100m 2002: 100m.
This unprovided taxation is stated after taking account of the FRS 19 capital allowance deferred tax provision of 86m 2002: 83m recorded in the Balance Sheet which, as described in note17, would be expected to be released on sale.
