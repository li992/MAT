Directors responsibilities The directors are required by law to prepare financial statements which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for the year.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: i select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: ii make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: iii state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: iv prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and group will continue in business.
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
