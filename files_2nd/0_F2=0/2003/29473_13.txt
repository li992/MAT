"BASIS OF PREPARATION The supplementary information on pages 81 to 87 shows the Groups life results as measured on an achieved profit basis, which includes the results of the Group's long-term assurance business on a basis determined in accordance with the ABI Guidance ""Supplementary Reporting for long term assurance business the achieved profits method "" issued in December 2001."
All other transactions and balances have been determined in accordance with the MSSB accounting policies noted on pages 53 to 56.
The objective of the achieved profit basis is to provide shareholders with more realistic information on the financial position and performance of the Group than that provided by the modified statutory solvency basis.
The Groups unit trust business is not included on an achieved profit basis within this supplementary information although it is in the unaudited financial information.
The achieved profit results for long-term assurance have been determined using an unsmoothed basis for projecting future unit growth.
As previously disclosed in the 2003 Interim Report, the 2002 results have been restated to an unsmoothed basis.
The effect of this change to an unsmoothed basis was also disclosed in the 2002 financial statements and is summarised in note V below.
METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS The Achieved Profits methodology recognises as profit the discounted value of the expected future statutory surpluses arising from the contracts in-force at the period end the value of long-term business in-force.
These future surpluses are calculated by projecting future cash flows using realistic assumptions for each component of the cash flow.
Actuarial assumptions for the mortality, morbidity and persistency experience of the contracts, expenses and taxation expected to be incurred are based on recent experience and are reviewed annually.
The future economic and investment conditions are based on the period end conditions and are likely to change from year to year.
Economic Assumptions The principal economic assumptions used within the cash flows at 31 December 2003 are set out below alongside the comparatives for 31 December 2002.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2003 2002 Risk discount rate net of tax 8.25% 8.00% Future investment returns: - Fixed Interest 4.75% 4.50% - Equities 7.25% 7.00% - Unit-linked funds: - Capital growth 3.75% 3.50% - Dividend income 3.00% 3.00% - T otal 6.75% 6.50% Expense inflation 4.25% 4.25% Indexation of capital gains 1.75% 1.75% The risk discount rate is used to discount the projected future cash flows from the business in-force to a present value.
The rate is set by reference to the assumed future investment returns.
NOTES TO THE ACHIEVED PROFIT RESULT continued 85 The assumed future pre-tax returns on fixed interest securities are set by reference to the 15 year gilt yield index.
The other investment returns are set by reference to this assumption.
The expense inflation and indexation of capital gains assumptions are based on the rate of inflation implicit in the current valuation of 15 year index-linked gilts currently 2.75%.
The expense inflation assumption is increased by a 1.5% loading to reflect increases in earnings and the indexation of capital gains is reduced by 1%.
Experience Assumptions The principal experience assumptions were derived as follows.
All experience assumptions are reviewed annually.
The persistency experience is derived where possible from the Companys own experience, or otherwise from external industry experience.
Maintenance expenses have been set in line with the costs charged by the Companys third party administrators, together with an allowance for the Company's own maintenance costs.
Mortality and morbidity assumptions have been set by reference to the Company's own experience, published industry data and the rates charged by the Company's reassurers.
A provision of 12.5 million before tax has been set up within the cash flows to provide for adverse morbidity and persistency experience on critical illness plans.
This is unchanged from 31 December 2002.
Other items The value of new business has been established at the end of the reporting period.
It has been calculated using actual acquisition costs.
In projecting future surpluses allowance has been made for the cost of maintaining a statutory solvency margin on the business in-force.
Recurring single premiums are treated as if they were individual single premiums.
Future taxation has been determined assuming a continuation of the current tax legislation.
The achieved profits results are calculated on an after-tax basis and are grossed up to the pre-tax level for presentation in the profit and loss account.
The rate of tax used was 30% except for the Irish life business, which was grossed up at 12.5%.
These are unchanged from 31 December 2002.
NOTES TO THE ACHIEVED PROFIT RESULT continued 86 III.
COMPONENTS OF LIFE ACHIEVED PROFIT The pre-tax components of the Achieved Profit result for life are shown below.
The basic operating Achieved Profit is determined using the assumptions as set out above in note II.
This value is subsequently adjusted to take into account items considered to be short-term variations to these longer-term assumptions to show the total achieved preand post-tax profit for the respective periods.
Restated Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2003 2002 Million Million New business contribution 13.5 18.7 Profit from existing business Unwind of discount rate 32.1 31.8 Experience variances 6.9 5.7 Operating assumption changes 2.8 0.5 Investment income 2.5 2.6 Life operating achieved profit before tax 44.0 59.3 Investment return variances 36.8 73.3 Economic assumption changes 1.2 2.5 One off budget changes 7.6 Cost of solvency capital 3.6 Life achieved profit loss before tax 68.4 11.5 Attributed tax 19.0 3.7 Life achieved profit loss after tax 49.4 7.8 The economic assumption changes reflect the effect of the movement in the economic bases noted in the methodology and assumptions.
The operating assumption changes reflect one-off changes to other assumptions used in the calculation of the achieved profit.
New business contribution after tax is 10.3 million 2002: 14.0 million.
NOTES TO THE ACHIEVED PROFIT RESULT continued 87 IV.
SENSITIVITIES The table below shows the impact of changes in economic assumptions on the reported value of new business and value of long-term business in-force of changes to the risk discount rate, the assumed rate of long-term investment return and market movements.
Change in the post-tax Change in new business value of long-term contribution business in-force Pre-tax Post-tax Million Million Million Reported value at 31 December 2003 13.5 10.3 313.1 Risk discount rate 1% 4.6 3.2 19.2 -1% 5.0 3.5 20.4 Investment return 1% 3.9 2.8 19.2 -1% 3.6 2.6 21.4 Current withdrawal rate x110% 2.7 1.9 11.5 x90% 2.9 2.0 11.1 Unit values 10% 29.6 -10% 26.3 V. INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTIONS As discussed in note I, the investment assumptions have been changed to an unsmoothed basis and the 2002 figures have been restated accordingly.
The impact of the removal of smoothing on the 2002 result was to reduce the Achieved Profit from life assurance business before tax by 43.9 million and reduce the Achieved Profit from life assurance business after tax by 31.4 million.
