The Directors have assessed the benefits to be derived from these acquisitions.
In the case of London Travel Service, they have considered it appropriate to write off the goodwill over a period of five years.
As there is no income stream attributable to the acquisition of Bridge Britain & Ireland the Directors consider it more appropriate, in this instance, to write off the goodwill in full at the date of acquisition.
Due to the nature of the acquisition, the business of London Travel Service was integrated into the existing Hotel Breaks Division and hence it is not possible to identify its contribution to the Groups operating results, net operating cash flows and returns on investment and servicing of finance.
The nature of the London Travel Service acquisition was that only the trade was acquired.
Historic information relating to the performance of this trade is not available as its results were not separately reported by its previous owners.
The book and fair value of the net assets acquired was nil.
