From 1 January 2003, for US GAAP purposes Unilever has adopted SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model usually an adjusted Black-Scholes or multinomial model and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
Variable plans, being those with performance criteria other than a service period, are also accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123.
The actual remuneration cost charged in each period is shown below.
Amounts for prior years have been restated to reect compensation costs for all the employee awards granted or modied in scal years beginning after 1994.
With effect from 1 January 2002, and for the purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets for US purposes, Unilever changed the method of valuing its pension plan assets from a market-related value calculated by smoothing gains and losses over a five-year period to an actual fair value at the balance sheet date.
Management believe that the actual fair value methodology provides a better representation of the financial position and results of Unilevers pension plans.
