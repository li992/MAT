Statement of Directors Responsibilities Financial statements, including adoption of going concern basis United Kingdom Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: and state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed.
Other matters The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
