RPS Group Plc 71 Report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain assets and are in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied: Prior year adjustment Following the introduction of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the presentation of the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP has been included within shareholders funds.
It was previously included within investments.
There is no effect on the profit and loss account.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the holding Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included from or up to the date of acquisition or disposal.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised and written off on a straightline basis over its useful economic life, of up to 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions made prior to 1st January 1998, was written off against reserves in the year of acquisition in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
Should a subsequent disposal occur any related goodwill written off to reserves will be charged to the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Directors consider that amortisation of goodwill should be separately disclosed on the face of the profit and loss account in order to give a fair presentation of the Groups results.
Valuation of investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
Turnover Turnover represents sales of services provided to customers during the year at invoiced amounts less applicable taxes, with the exception of income billed in advance which is deferred until the Group has the right to that consideration.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets, excluding freehold land, over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Fixtures, fittings, IT and equipment 12.5% 33% per annum on cost Motor vehicles 25% per annum on cost Alterations to short leasehold premises Straight line over life of the lease Freehold buildings 2% per annum on cost Revaluation of properties The Group has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements in FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets and retained the book values of certain freehold properties that were revalued prior to implementation of that standard.
Where an asset that was previously revalued is disposed of, its book value is eliminated and an appropriate transfer made from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account.
Leased assets and assets held under hire purchase contracts Where assets are financed by hire purchase or leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership finance leases, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright.
The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term.
The corresponding leasing commitments are shown as amounts payable to the lessor.
Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss account.
Lease payments are split between capital and interest using the actuarial method and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account.
All other leases are treated as operating leases.
Their annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Section 03 Accounts RPS Group Plc 72 Report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation Profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate during the year, with the balance sheet translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences which arise on translation of the opening net assets and the results of overseas operations for the year are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency transactions of individual companies are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Page 52 of the corporate governance section provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The numerical disclosures in note 30 deal with the financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in FRS 13.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosure, other than in the currency risk disclosure.
Pension costs Contributions to the Companys defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they become payable.
The cost of pensions in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of the employees.
Actuarial surpluses and deficits are spread forward over the average remaining service life of the employees.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and the amount actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The scheme for the employees in the Netherlands is a multi-employer scheme that has characteristics of both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
Because the scheme actuaries are unable to apportion the gains losses appropriately it has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
Work in progress Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated as cost of labour, together with attributable overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion.
Regular reviews are undertaken and any impairment is provided for.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP In accordance with UITF 38, the assets, income and expenditure of the ESOP Trust are incorporated into the Group and Company Financial Statements.

Derivatives and other financial instruments Set out below are the narrative disclosures relating to financial instruments.
The numerical disclosures are set out in notes 30 and 31.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments not to provide numerical disclosures in relation to short-term debtors and creditors, other than currency risk disclosures.
Financial instruments The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group occasionally uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has investments in overseas operations in the Netherlands, Ireland, America and Australia that have functional currencies other than sterling.
As a result the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movement in the exchange rate between sterling and the functional currencies of overseas operations.
The most important exchange rate as far as RPS is concerned is the pound euro rate.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the Group.
The Group does not hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
Interest rate risk The Group has a small number of short-term financial liabilities principally in sterling at fixed and floating rates of interest.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term deposit or held within accounts bearing interest related to bank base rate.
Liquidity risk The Group has strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a country basis.
30 Foreign currency risk The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their own functional currency.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of these assets and liabilities were taken to the profit and loss account of the Group companies and the Group during the year.

The pension cost charge of these schemes amounted to 1,953,000 for the year ended 31st December 2003 2002: 1,505,000.

The M C OSullivan & Co Pension and Life Assurance Plan is a defined benefit funded scheme.
This is valued by an independent qualified actuary every three years.
The most recent valuation of the scheme was at 1st April 2003 using the age attained method.
The principle assumptions adopted in the valuation were that the long-term rate of return would be 7% and the average annual increase to pensionable salaries would be 4.5%.
The market value of the assets at the valuation date was 2,571,000 and this represented 80% of past service liabilities using projected salaries.
The deficit is being amortised over the future working lifetime of the current active membership.
