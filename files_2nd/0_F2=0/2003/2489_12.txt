2003 2002 m m c Depreciation includes Depreciation in respect of assets held under finance leases 25 30 d Goodwill amortisation has mainly arisen from the initial acquisition of Rothmans and subsequent local restructurings of the enlarged Groups publicly listed subsidiaries in Singapore, Australia and South Africa in 1999, together with the restructuring of the Groups investment in Imasco in 2000 and the British American Tobacco Australasia minority buyout.
The goodwill arising on these transactions is being amortised over a period of 20 years.
The amortisation charge is shown as additional information on the face of the profit and loss account and for 2003 includes 270 million in respect of the initial acquisition of Rothmans and the subsequent restructurings, 109 million in respect of Imasco and 17 million in respect of Australasia.
2003 2002 m m e US Tobacco settlements ongoing costs 566 801 During the fourth quarter of 1998, a Master Settlement Agreement MSA was reached with Attorneys General in 46 US states the Settling States to settle the outstanding Medicaid recovery suits.
The initial costs in respect of this agreement, together with the initial costs arising from the earlier settlement between the US cigarette companies and the State of Minnesota and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, were charged in 1998 and 1999.
This included initial payments to those parties, together with legal fees, and also included the impact of Most Favoured Nation Clauses which increased amounts due under previous state settlements and advances on legal fees.
In addition, the four leading US tobacco manufacturers have agreed to make annual payments, commencing in 1999 for 12 years, to states with tobacco grower communities to compensate them for any adverse effect of the settlement agreements.
The US tobacco industry will incur ongoing costs under the agreement with the Settling States.
The US tobacco manufacturers who entered into the agreement the Settling Companies have agreed to make payments to the Settling States in perpetuity.
The actual payments will be adjusted annually to reect changes in industry volume, ination and other factors.
Additionally, the Settling Companies will pay fees of the Settling States attorneys, and the amounts payable will be set by arbitration with a US$500 million annual cap for the first five years which rises to US$750 million in years 6 to 10 inclusive, less amounts previously paid as liquidated fees or by agreement.
34 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 Notes on the accounts continued profit and loss account 1 Operating profit continued These payments will be allocated among the Settling Companies based on their relative annual market share in each year, which in 2003 was approximately 11.5 per cent for Brown & Williamson 2002 12.2 per cent.
During 2003, agreement was reached on certain disputed MSA payments relating to MSA calculations based on 1999 and 2000 sales.
This agreement resulted in a benefit of 27 million which is excluded from the 2003 costs shown above.
f Operating charges in 2003 include restructuring costs, which were the costs incurred as a result of a review of the Groups manufacturing operations and organisational structure.
These costs are shown as additional information on the face of the profit and loss account and comprised: 2003 2002 m m Staff-related costs 224 Depreciation 146 Other 67 437 g Acquisitions during 2003 in Peru and Serbia contributed 26 million and 3 million respectively to Group turnover excluding duty, excise and other taxes and 6 million profit and 1 million loss respectively to operating profit before charging restructuring costs of 2 million for Peru.
2 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries In 2003, the loss on disposal of subsidiaries amounted to 72 million before tax and 76 million after tax.
On 29 September 2003, a subsidiary of the Group absolutely and irrevocably transferred to a newly created Trust all of its rights, title and interest in and to 100 per cent of the issued and outstanding shares of The Flintkote Company Flintkote together with US$3 million in cash and did not receive any consideration in return.
The Trust, administered by an independent trustee, has been created for the management, conservation and eventual disposition of the assets transferred to the Trust and names a medical facility active in the research and treatment of asbestos-related diseases as ultimate beneciary.
The Group will have no continuing involvement in the Trust.
Since by virtue of this arrangement Flintkote is no longer a Group subsidiary, the Group has ceased to consolidate Flintkote effective 29 September 2003.
The transfer resulted in a loss on disposal of 62 million before tax.
Flintkote, a US company, was part of the acquisition of Genstar Corporation by Imasco Limited in 1986 and became a Group subsidiary following the restructuring of Imasco in 2000.
Flintkote has been named, along with a large number of defendants, in numerous actions by individuals who seek damages based upon alleged exposure to asbestos products, or alleged damage to their buildings due to the presence in the buildings of certain materials containing asbestos, allegedly manufactured and or sold by such defendants.
Certain of these claims and suits allege significant damage.
All claims relate to businesses which ceased active operations in the early 1970s.
To date substantially all of the claim costs and legal expenses incurred in connection with these suits have been covered by insurance proceeds and this continues.
However, there remain a number of factors, beyond the control of Flintkote, that could impact its future costs.
Regardless of the outcome of current and potential future claims against Flintkote, in the Directors view no future costs should accrue to the Group beyond what has already been presented in these financial statements.
The loss on disposals also includes a provision for losses on the announced sale of the Groups shareholding of a company in Myanmar.

The major causes of this difference are listed below: 2003 2002 m m profit on ordinary activities before tax excluding share of associates and joint ventures profit before tax 1,496 1,996 Corporation Tax at 30.00% 2002 30.00% on profit on ordinary activities 449 599 Factors affecting the tax rate: Tax at standard rates other than UK corporation tax rate 1 14 National tax rate reliefs 16 15 State and local taxes 70 72 Non-deductible goodwill amortisation 123 119 Permanent differences 62 5 Timing differences 25 23 Overseas withholding taxes 47 33 Double taxation relief on UK profits 5 3 Unutilised tax losses 65 31 Adjustments in respect of previous periods 49 44 Total current taxation charge note 5 a 772 778 36 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 Notes on the accounts continued profit and loss account 6 Dividends and other appropriations 2003 2002 pence 2003 pence 2002 per share m per share m a On ordinary shares Interim 2003 paid 15 September 2003 11.80 247 2002 paid 16 September 2002 10.70 229 Final 2003 payable 27 April 2004 27.00 552 2002 paid 22 April 2003 24.50 526 38.80 799 35.20 755 b On convertible redeemable preference shares Interim 2003 paid 15 September 2003 11.80 14 2002 paid 16 September 2002 10.70 13 Final 2003 payable 27 April 2004 27.00 33 2002 paid 22 April 2003 24.50 29 Amortisation of discount page 71 note 32 18 18 38.80 65 35.20 60 7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are based on equity earnings of 566 million 2002 1,092 million and 2,102 million 2002 2,145 million ordinary shares of 25p each, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
To comply with FRS14 the weighted average number of shares in issue exclude shares held by British American Tobacco and B.
A. T Industries Employee Share Ownership Trusts.
For the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is increased to 2,241 million 2002 2,299 million to reect the potential dilutive effect of the convertible redeemable preference shares and employee share schemes.
The earnings are correspondingly adjusted to the amount of earnings prior to charging dividends and the amortisation of discount on the convertible redeemable preference shares.
For 2003, the convertible redeemable preference shares were not dilutive for the unadjusted earnings per share calculation and therefore the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to 2,121 million.
Earnings have been affected by a number of exceptional items.
To illustrate the impact of the principal distortions, as well as the effect of goodwill amortisation, an alternative earnings per share is shown below: Diluted Basic 2003 2002 2003 2002 pence pence pence pence Unadjusted earnings per share 26.69 50.10 26.93 50.91 Convertible redeemable preference shares 1.47 Effect of goodwill amortisation 18.07 16.44 19.27 17.62 Effect of restructuring costs 15.71 16.75 Effect of write down of loan to joint venture 3.88 4.14 Effect of disposal of subsidiaries 3.39 3.61 Adjusted earnings per share 69.21 66.54 70.70 68.53 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 37 Notes on the accounts continued Balance sheet 8 Intangible assets m Cost 1 January 2003 7,500 Differences on exchange 480 Additions page 47 note 21 1,767 31 December 2003 9,747 Amortisation 1 January 2003 1,252 Differences on exchange 78 Charge for year page 32 note 1 405 31 December 2003 1,735 Net book value 31 December 2003 8,012 Net book value 31 December 2002 6,248 9 Tangible xed assets Plant, Freehold Leasehold machinery Assets in land and land and and course of buildings buildings equipment construction Total m m m m m Cost 1 January 2003 947 173 3,836 275 5,231 Differences on exchange 75 8 324 19 426 Additions 10 4 214 199 427 Acquisitions 116 12 215 46 389 Reallocations 27 28 193 248 Disposals 17 3 244 264 31 December 2003 1,008 206 3,890 253 5,357 Depreciation 1 January 2003 338 44 2,247 2,629 Differences on exchange 30 2 212 244 Acquisitions 54 156 165 Charge for year page 32 note 1 61 11 392 464 Disposals 17 3 215 235 31 December 2003 357 54 2,368 2,779 Net book values 31 December 2003 651 152 1,522 253 2,578 Net book values 31 December 2002 609 129 1,589 275 2,602 2003 2002 m m Cost of land on which no depreciation is provided 87 96 Leasehold land and buildings comprise net book value of long leasehold 92 72 net book value of short leasehold 60 57 152 129 Net book value of assets held under finance leases 70 82 Contracts placed for future expenditure 20 43 38 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 Notes on the accounts continued Balance sheet 10 Investments in associates and joint ventures pages 67 to 68 m 1 January 2003 including loans of 148 million 347 Differences on exchange 4 Retentions before write down of loan to joint venture 55 Write down of loan to joint venture 87 Change in status 9 Other movements 25 31 December 2003 327 2003 2002 m m Listed overseas market value 980 million 2002 694 million 238 198 Unlisted 89 149 327 347 The change in status relates to British American Racing Holdings Ltd, see page 49 note 21.

The majority of these contracts hedged oating interest rate risks and resulted in weighted average xed interest rates over the remaining life of the contracts as shown below: Weighted average Principal xed interest rate 2003 2002 2003 2002 Currency m m % % UK sterling 100 300 5.6 5.0 Euro 200 2.6 Australian dollar 320 5.0 Swiss franc 300 345 0.7 2.1 In addition, at 31 December 2003, there were xed to oating interest rate swap contracts covering 1 billion of xed rate borrowings.
Floating rate financial liabilities principally bear interest at rates based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The average interest rate for total borrowings is estimated to be 5.2 per cent 2002 5.3 per cent.

Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps, caps, collars, cross-currency Fair value is based on market price of comparable instruments at the swaps and forward foreign currency contracts balance sheet date.
Fixed rate borrowings and loans and deposits The fair value has been estimated using either market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date or discounted cash ow analysis.
Other investments and current investments The fair value is based on quoted market prices, market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date or discounted cash ow analysis.
Convertible redeemable preference shares The fair value for 2003 is based on the quoted market price of the ordinary shares of British American Tobacco p. l. c. into which they are convertible in June 2004.
In 2002, a discounted cash ow analysis was used, assuming total redemption in June 2004.
British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 45 18 Financial instruments continued Hedges As explained in the Directors report on pages 2 to 3, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk Using interest and cross-currency swaps and interest rate agreements such as caps and collars.
Currency risk Using cross-currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the currency risk on borrowings in order to hedge net investments overseas.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used for currency exposures on unsettled trading transactions and future sales.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet unrecognised and on-balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.

British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 47 Notes on the accounts continued Other financial information 21 Acquisitions In 2003, the principal acquisition and goodwill arising was in respect of Ente Tabacchi Italiani as described in note a below.
In addition, there were acquisitions in Peru and Serbia, as well as the change in status of British American Racing Holdings to a subsidiary as described in note b below.
Acquisitions in 2002 principally relate to the purchase of substantially all of the minority interest in A T BAT Prilucky Tobacco Co. and the acquisition of a business concern in Italy.
The total consideration for these acquisitions was 12 million.
Net tangible assets acquired were not material.
a Ente Tabacchi Italiani S. p. A.
On 16 July 2003, the Group announced a successful bid to acquire Ente Tabacchi Italiani S. p. A. ETI, the Italian state tobacco company.
Completion of this transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was subsequently given and on 23 December 2003 the Group completed the purchase of ETI.
The provisional goodwill of 1,598 million arises as follows: Accounting Book value Revaluation policies Other Fair value m m m m m Goodwill 80 80 Intangible assets 10 10 Tangible xed assets 211 7 4 200 Restructuring: asset write downs 14 14 Stocks 205 7 14 184 Debtors 524 7 1 14 544 Current investments, short term deposits and cash 66 66 Restructuring provisions 11 11 Other provisions 79 2 6 83 Borrowings 55 55 Creditors 791 6 785 Fair value of assets acquired 146 7 1 80 60 Goodwill 1,598 Consideration 1,658 Consideration satisfied by: Cash 1,641 UK acquisition costs 11 Deferred consideration 6 1,658 i The book values of the net assets and liabilities have been revalued to fair value as at the acquisition date.
The main adjustments are revaluations of land and buildings, together with a reduction in the carrying value of plant and machinery and stock and the related effect on deferred tax.
The accounting policies adjustments relate to the reversal of provisions and the related effect on deferred tax.
The Other column includes the reclassication of items in the local books to the presentation required in the Group accounts, together with the removal of goodwill carried in the local books.
ii Although the acquisition took place on 23 December 2003, the ETI profit for the period after that date is not material for the Group results.
Therefore, the effective date of acquisition has been deemed to be 31 December 2003.
48 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 Notes on the accounts continued Other financial information 21 Acquisitions continued iii For the 3 months ended 31 December 2003, ETIs results are estimated as follows, based on Italian accounting principles: m Net turnover 474 Operating profit 24 Net interest 1 Extraordinary items restructuring 25 profit before taxation Taxation 2 profit after taxation 2 Goodwill amortisation 5 7 For the year ended 30 September 2003, ETIs profit after taxation and minority interest was 63 million.
b Other acquisitions i On 4 April 2003, the Group announced that it had acquired controlling interests in a number of companies in Peru, including the leading tobacco company, Tabacalera Nacional S. A.
With the aggregate consideration to the vendors of all the various shareholdings acquired of 146 million, the goodwill arising on these transactions is provisionally estimated at 123 million.
The consideration of 146 million comprises 141 million of cash, 2 million of deferred consideration and UK acquisition costs of 3 million.
No material adjustments were made between the book value of net assets acquired and the fair value of 23 million total assets 35 million.
In the periods prior to acquisition, the combined profits after tax of the companies, prepared on the basis of Peruvian accounting principles, were 9 million for the year to 31 December 2002 and an estimated 4 million for the period to 4 April 2003. ii On 4 August 2003, the Group was confirmed as the winning bidder for a controlling interest in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje.
This transaction was completed on 22 September 2003.
The initial holding of 68 per cent was subsequently increased to 78 per cent in December 2003.
The fair values of total assets and net assets acquired were 12 million and 3 million respectively.
The main adjustments to local book values in arriving at the fair values were removal of 7 million of local goodwill, xed asset and stock write downs of 7 million and 6 million respectively and 6 million in respect of an onerous contract, together with the consequent impact on minority interests.
The total consideration for this acquisition was 43 million resulting in goodwill of 40 million.
The consideration was satisfied by 41 million of cash and UK acquisition costs of 2 million.
In the period prior to the acquisition, the results on the basis of Serbian accounting policies were a loss after tax of 2 million for the year to 31 December 2002 and an estimated break even position after tax for the period to 22 September 2003.
British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 49 21 Acquisitions continued iii On 12 December 2003, the Group converted US$136 million 90 million of its convertible loan stocks in British American Racing Holdings Ltd BAR, raising its shareholding in the company from 50 per cent to 89 per cent and so changing the status of that company from a joint venture to a Group subsidiary.
There was no material difference between the fair value and book value of the net liabilities acquired.
The transaction resulted in no goodwill.
m Share 89 per cent of fair value of net liabilities at date of acquisition 79 Add: Group share of reduction in net liabilities arising from conversion of loan stock 38 fair value of share of net liabilities as a joint venture 44 3 Goodwill Consideration: convertible loan stock after write down page 68 3 When an associate or joint venture becomes a subsidiary, the method for calculating goodwill differs between the Companies Act 1985 and FRS2.
In order to give a true and fair view, the Group has complied with FRS2 in arriving at the gures above.
If the Act had been followed, the goodwill arising on acquisition would have been 44 million as it would have reected the share of accumulated net losses while the company had been treated as a joint venture.
In the periods prior to acquisition, the results of BAR were a loss after tax of 41 million for the 13 months ended 31 December 2002 and a loss after tax of 29 million for the period to 12 December 2003.

50 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 Notes on the accounts continued Other financial information 23 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments There are contingent liabilities in respect of litigation, overseas taxes and guarantees in various countries.
Product liability litigation Group companies, notably Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation B&W, as well as other leading cigarette manufacturers, are defendants, principally in the United States, in a number of product liability cases.
In a number of these cases, the amounts of compensatory and punitive damages sought are significant.
US litigation The total number of US product liability cases pending at year end involving Group companies was approximately 4,302 2002 4,219 cases.
UK based Group companies have been named as co-defendants in some 1,128 of those cases 2002 1,272 cases.
Only perhaps a couple of dozen cases or fewer are likely to come to trial in 2004.
Since many of these pending cases seek unspecified damages, it is not possible to quantify the total amounts being claimed, but the aggregate amounts involved in such litigation are significant.
External legal fees and other external product liability defence costs were 66 million in 2003 2002 66 million.
The cases fall into four broad categories: 1 Medical reimbursement cases These civil actions seek to recover amounts spent by government entities and other third party providers on healthcare and welfare costs claimed to result from illnesses associated with smoking.
Despite the almost uniform success of the industrys defence to these actions to date, the United States Department of Justice has led suit against the leading US cigarette manufacturers, certain afliated companies including parent companies and others, seeking reimbursement for Medicare and other health expenses incurred by the US Federal Government as well as various equitable remedies, including paying over of proceeds from alleged unlawful acts.
The court has dismissed the reimbursement claims and has dismissed B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. on jurisdictional grounds but is allowing the government to proceed with its claims for equitable relief which includes a claim for disgorgement of profit up to US$289 billion against the industry.
The court has scheduled trial for September 2004.
As at 31 December 2003, similar reimbursement suits were pending against B&W amongst others by two Indian tribes and by one county or other political subdivisions of the states.
The Master Settlement Agreement with the 46 states includes a credit for any amounts paid in suits brought by the states political subdivisions: nevertheless, B&W intends to defend these cases vigorously.
Based on somewhat different theories of claim are some five non-governmental medical reimbursement cases and health insurers claims.
To date, eight federal appellate courts have issued decisions dismissing this type of case entirely and some but not all state courts have issued similar decisions.
In 2001, B&W tried one health insurer case in New York Federal Court Empire Blue Cross, where the jury returned a defence verdict on three of the five claims.
The two BAT UK based companies were dismissed, B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. by agreement with the plaintiff and a full defence verdict obtained by the remaining BAT UK company.
On the two claims where the jury found for the plaintiff, the jury awarded damages in the aggregate amount of US$17.8 million.
As to B&W specically, the jury awarded US$2.8 million.
The trial judge has awarded US$37.8 million in fees to the plaintiffs lawyers: that amount has not been allocated among individual defendants.
The case is now on appeal before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the eight federal appellate courts that has already issued a decision dismissing this type of case entirely.
No third party reimbursement cases are currently scheduled for trial in 2004.
2 Class actions As at 31 December 2003, B&W was named as a defendant in some 36 2002 47 separate actions attempting to assert claims on behalf of classes of persons allegedly injured or nancially impacted by smoking.
While most courts refused to do so, 13 have certied classes of tobacco claimants in cases involving B&W but six of these classes have subsequently been decertied.
Even if the classes remain certied and the possibility of class-based liability is eventually established, it is likely that individual trials will still be necessary to resolve any actual claims.
If this happens, it is possible that many of the defences that have contributed to more than 600 individual cases being successfully disposed of over the years by B&W will be available.
British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 51 23 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments continued In the first phase of the three phase trial in Engle Florida, the jury returned a verdict that included general findings that smoking causes several specified diseases and other findings including that the defendants conduct rose to a level that would permit a potential award of punitive damages.
The second phase of the trial included two parts.
The first part of phase two was a trial of the three named class representatives compensatory damages claims.
In that part, the jury awarded a total of US$12.7 million to the three class representatives but found that one of the representatives claims US$5.8 million of that total was time-barred.
In the second part of phase two, the jury assessed US$17.6 billion in punitive damages against B&W and US$127 billion in total punitive damages against the other major companies in the US tobacco industry.
B&W posted a surety bond in the amount of US$100 million the amount required by Florida law to stay execution of this punitive damages award.
The trial plan anticipated a series of additional individual trials for every member of the class the so-called phase three of the plan, which would have taken many years.
On 21 May 2003, the intermediate appellate court reversed the trial courts judgement and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to decertify the class.
Plaintiffs are seeking further review by the Florida Supreme Court.
B&W continues to believe condently that the Florida Supreme Court will uphold the reversal of the trial courts judgement against B&W.
In the first phase three trial of an individual Engle class member Lukacs, the jury awarded the plaintiff US$37.5 million in compensatory damages B&Ws share: US$8.4 million.
Defendants are appealing that award.
In a Louisiana medical monitoring case brought on behalf of Louisiana smokers Scott, phase one of the trial began in January 2003.
On 28 July 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favour of the defendants on the medical monitoring claim.
However, the jury made findings against the defendants with respect to claims relating to fraud, conspiracy, marketing to minors and smoking cessation.
The court has scheduled a phase two trial to begin on 29 March 2004 to address the scope and cost of smoking cessation programmes.
A federal judge in New York certied a nationwide  class Simon II in September 2002.
Although the judge initially set the case for trial in 2003, the case has been stayed while the defendants seek appellate review of the class certication.
3 Individual cases Approximately 4,245 cases were pending against B&W at 31 December 2003 2002 4,123 led by or on behalf of individuals in which it is contended that diseases or deaths have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ETS.
Of these cases: a approximately two thirds are ETS cases brought by ight attendants who were members of a class action Broin that was settled on terms that allow compensatory but not punitive damages claims by class members: b approximately one quarter of the individual cases against B&W are cases brought in consolidated proceedings in West Virginia in which B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. and another BAT UK company are also involved: and c only about 10 per cent are cases led by other individuals.
Four of the ten cases tried during 2003 resulted in verdicts against B&W at the trial court level.
In April 2003, a Florida jury Eastman awarded US$650,000 damages against B&W.
In May 2003, an Arkansas jury Boerner awarded US$4 million in compensatory damages and US$15 million in punitive damages against B&W.
In November 2003, a Missouri jury Thompson awarded US$210,000 damages against B&W.
In December 2003, a New York jury Frankson awarded US$350,000 compensatory damages against B&W and two industry organisations.
In January 2004, the same jury awarded US$20 million punitive damages.
B&W is appealing all these verdicts.
4 Other claims As at 31 December 2003, seven 2002 eight cases were pending on behalf of asbestos companies.
Those companies seek reimbursement for costs and judgements paid in litigation brought by third parties against them.
These companies claim that, but for the smoking of the claimants, their damages would have been less.
As at 31 December 2003, B&W was named as defendant in four 2002 28 US cases brought by foreign government entities seeking reimbursement of medical costs which they incurred for treatment for persons in their own countries who are alleged to have smoked imported cigarettes, including those manufactured by B&W.
Thirty four foreign government cases have been dismissed.
52 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 Notes on the accounts continued Other financial information 23 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments continued B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. has been named as a co-defendant in the US in most of the medical reimbursement cases, in a quarter or fewer of the class actions and in the consolidated proceedings of over 1,000 individual cases in West Virginia, aside from which it is involved in only a few individual cases.
It is contesting the jurisdiction of the US courts since it is a holding company not transacting business in the United States.
A. T Industries p. l. c. has successfully contested jurisdiction in 35 cases prior to trial.
In the balance of these cases, there has been no adverse ruling on the issue of jurisdiction afrmed on the merits through appeal.
Some 193 US plaintiffs have voluntarily agreed to drop B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. or substitute the Companys indirectly held subsidiary British American Tobacco Investments Limited formerly called British-American Tobacco Company Ltd as a co-defendant.
Product liability outside the United States At year end, active claims against Group companies existed in 18 countries outside the United States but the only countries with more than five active claims were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
Conduct-based claims Conduct-based claims, including antitrust and RICO claims, have been led in the United States.
Among these are some eight class action antitrust cases brought by wholesalers or retailers alleging that B&W and other major US cigarette manufacturers conspired to x prices for cigarettes.
Although plaintiffs in these class actions have not specified the damages they claim, the amounts could be significant.
None of these conduct-based claims are considered to be meritorious.
Conclusion While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, the Company believes that the defences of the Group companies to all these various claims are meritorious both on the law and the facts, and a vigorous defence is being made everywhere.
If an adverse judgement were entered against any of the Group companies in any case, an appeal would be made.
Such appeals could require the appellants to post appeal bonds or substitute security in amounts which could in some cases equal or exceed the amount of the judgement.
At least in the aggregate and despite the quality of defences available to the Group, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash ows of the Group in particular quarterly or annual periods could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.

The Groups subsidiary undertakings operate over 120 active retirement benefit arrangements worldwide.
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of employees belong to dened benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally, although the Group also operates a number of dened contribution schemes.
The contributions to the dened benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries.
Pension commitments are nanced according to accepted current practices in each country, which for the material arrangements means using the projected unit method with surpluses or deficits being amortised over the average expected remaining service lives of the respective memberships.
All schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The total market value of pension scheme assets at the dates of the most recent formal actuarial valuations or later formal reviews of the externally funded dened benefit schemes was 3,350 million 2002 3,445 million, 580 million 2002 185 million lower than the total value of projected accrued benets at the same dates.
Any deficit or surplus in individual schemes is being eliminated by increased or reduced company contributions, amendments to scheme benets or a combination of both.
Valuations for the Groups largest externally funded dened benefit schemes are based on the assumptions shown in the following table, including assets at market value.
These schemes accounted for over 80 per cent of the total obligations of the Groups externally funded schemes.

Pension increases, where allowed for, were generally assumed to be in line with ination.
In certain countries, pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis.
In such cases provisions are included in the Group balance sheet.
These amounted to 638 million 2002 604 million, see page 40 note 16.
The most significant component of these provisions is a scheme in Germany, where a provision of 473 million was held in the balance sheet at the end of 2003 2002 439 million in respect of these obligations.
The annual cost was 33 million 2002 29 million.
At 31 December 2003, investments in equities, bonds and property with an estimated market value of 475 million 2002 387 million were pledged in respect of the liabilities, see page 38 note 11.
The liabilities and annual costs for the scheme have been determined using a 5.8 per cent investment return with some allowance for salary and pension increases, in line with or more conservative than normal local practice.
The Group also operates significant plans in the United States and Canada which provide employees with certain other retirement benets such as healthcare.
The liabilities in respect of these benets are assessed by qualied independent actuaries, applying the projected unit method.
The discount rate assumptions used were 6.25 per cent in the US and 6 per cent in Canada.
For healthcare ination, in the US the assumption was 11 per cent reducing to 5.25 per cent by 2012 and in Canada 10 per cent reducing to 5 per cent by 2009.
The current year and prior year provisions are shown on page 40 note 16.
FRS17 Retirement Benets During 2003, the Group has continued to account for retirement benefit costs in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs and the information shown above has been prepared in accordance with this standard.
The Group has not yet fully adopted FRS17 but the information provided below reects its transitional disclosure requirements.
As noted in last years accounts, in 2002 changes were made to the contractual trust arrangement that governs the main pension scheme in Germany such that the scheme has been treated as a funded scheme for the purposes of FRS17 from 1 January 2002.
The last formal actuarial valuations of the material dened benefit schemes have been updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2003 by qualied independent actuaries.
The major assumptions weighted to reect individual scheme differences used by the actuaries in the following principal countries were as follows: UK US Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland %%%%%% Rate of increase in salaries 4.80 3.40 3.10 4.00 3.50 2.40 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.80 2.20 1.80 Nil 2.15 1.00 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.80 Nil Nil Nil 2.15 Discount rate 5.40 6.25 5.50 5.63 5.25 3.75 General ination 2.80 2.75 1.60 3.00 2.00 1.50 For healthcare ination, in the US the assumption was 11 per cent reducing to 5.25 per cent by 2012 and in Canada 10 per cent reducing to 5 per cent by 2009.
British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2003 55 24 Retirement benefit schemes continued For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions were that real salary increases will be from 1 per cent to 3 per cent per annum and discount rates will be from 2 to 5 per cent above ination.
The major assumptions weighted to reect individual scheme differences used by the actuaries as at 31 December 2002 were as follows: UK US Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland %%%%%% Rate of increase in salaries 4.30 3.35 3.40 4.00 3.50 2.40 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.30 2.20 2.00 Nil 2.30 1.50 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.30 Nil Nil Nil 2.30 Discount rate 5.50 6.75 6.00 6.05 5.35 4.00 General ination 2.30 2.75 1.90 3.00 2.00 1.50 For healthcare ination, in the US the assumption was 11 per cent reducing to 5.25 per cent by 2011 and in Canada 10 per cent reducing to 5 per cent by 2008.
For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions were that real salary increases will be from 1 per cent to 3 per cent per annum and discount rates from 2 to 5 per cent above ination.
The major assumptions weighted to reect individual scheme differences used by the actuaries as at 31 December 2001 were as follows: UK US Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland %%%%%% Rate of increase in salaries 4.50 4.15 2.50 4.00 4.67 2.75 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 2.25 1.50 Nil 3.00 1.50 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.50 Nil Nil Nil 3.00 Discount rate 5.80 7.25 6.00 6.52 5.92 4.25 General ination 2.50 3.75 1.50 3.00 3.00 1.50 For healthcare ination, in the US the assumption was 11 per cent reducing to 5.25 per cent by 2009 and in Canada 10 per cent reducing to 5 per cent by 2006.
For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions were that real salary increases will be from 1 per cent to 4 per cent per annum and discount rates from Nil to 6 per cent above ination.
2003 2002 m m Contributions made to funded dened benefit schemes in respect of the current year pension schemes 179 94 healthcare schemes 25 25 Contributions to pension schemes include 47 million 2002 20 million in respect of increases in pledged investments in Germany.
The other main increases in contributions were for the schemes in the UK, US and Canada.
Future contribution rates will be agreed after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded dened benefit schemes, taking into account regulatory requirements.
There are a number of closed schemes where the current service cost expressed as a percentage of pensionable earnings will increase under the projected unit method as scheme members approach retirement age.
It is considered that the increase in these costs will not be material in the context of the Groups total retirement benefit scheme costs.
