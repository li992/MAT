No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings as no dividends had been accrued at the balance sheet date.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on surpluses recognised on revalued properties.
The total amount unprovided for is 0.8m.
Such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.

50 THE LAIRD GROUP PLC Notes to the accounts note 7 Earnings per share and results from continuing operations The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on a profit for the year of 23.8m 2002 loss 60.2m and 141.9m 2002 141.6m shares, being a daily average of the shares in issue during the year.
Continuing earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation is shown as the Board considers it to be a relevant guide to the performance of the Group.
The continuing profits and earnings for 2002 were calculated on the basis that the discontinued activities were divested on the first day of the year with interest accruing at 3.6% on the proceeds of 20m for the full year.
The tax charge for the year from continuing operations, calculated after adding back certain exceptional tax credits of 8.5m, is equivalent to 18% 2002 23% of the profit before operating exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and loss on disposal of businesses.

Approximately 700 2002 700 employees are members of seven different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,900 2002 1,900 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes and the charge for the year was 2.0m 2002 2.9m.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs are assessed by independent actuaries, full actuarial valuations being made every three years using either the projected unit or attained age methods.
The most recent actuarial valuations were made between April 2001 and January 2003.
Defined benefit schemes have continued to be accounted for in accordance with SSAP 24.
Generally the main assumption applied to the valuations was that the long term rate of return on scheme assets would exceed future general average earnings inflation by at least 2% 2002 2% per annum.
As at the dates of the most recent actuarial valuations, the defined benefit schemes in aggregate showed assets, including annuities purchased to secure pensions, with a total value of 60m 2002 62m which were sufficient to cover 98.5% 2002 103% of the value of benefits accrued to members.
It is expected that when new full actuarial valuations are next carried out the resulting assets and liabilities will be different to those described above.
These schemes have been assessed as at 31 December 2003 in the manner prescribed by the new Accounting Standard, FRS 17, in order to provide an indication of how these schemes would have been reflected in the Group Accounts under FRS 17, which was to have come fully into effect for the Group Accounts for the year ending 31 December 2003 but which has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2003 at their market value is estimated at 61m 2002 57m and the liabilities estimated at 69m 2002 64m.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under FRS 17 is 8m 2002 7m, which, in future years, were FRS 17 to be adopted, would result in a decrease in the Groups reserves of 6m 2002 5m, being the 8m, net pension liability offset by 2m 2002 2m of related deferred tax.
Since last year equity markets have risen, however this increase has not been sufficient to offset reductions in corporate bond yields and higher inflation both of which impact upon the value of discounted liabilities, resulting in a higher aggregate net pension liability as measured under FRS 17.
Although SSAP 24 indicates that the total value of the funds, on the basis of the most recent full actuarial valuations, were sufficient to cover 98.5% 2002 103% of the liabilities, the Group is aware that pension costs as calculated under SSAP 24 for some of the schemes could also be affected by the current economic trends, although it does not believe that a significant increase in employer contributions to these schemes is currently required.
The main assets in the schemes, stated at their estimated market value under FRS 17 at 31 December, were as follows.
2003 2002 m m Insurance Companies: Deposit Administration Contracts 4.8 4.8 Annuities 11.1 14.6 Equities 28.7 22.4 Gilts and bonds 13.8 14.5 Other including cash 2.8 1.0 61.2 57.3 The deposits with insurance companies are invested in equities and bonds.
There are minor variations in the assumptions used by the different actuaries employed to value the separate schemes.
The expected long term rates of return on the insurance company deposits and gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.8% per annum 2002 4.5% and those for equities at 8.5% per annum 2002 8%.
The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
For FRS 17 the schemes liabilities have mainly been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 2.7% per annum 2002 2.5%, salary increases of 3.7% per annum 2002 4.25% and a discount rate for liabilities of 5.6% per annum 2002 5.75%.
Some of the schemes provide pensions with increases linked to the cost of living, but the majority of pensions in payment and deferred pensions have no guaranteed increases.

Currency exposure is largely on translation as the value of cross currency transactions is limited with most of the transactions in local currency.
The Groups policy is for subsidiaries to take out forward foreign exchange contracts to cover their net transaction exposures to foreign currencies.
Balance sheet translation exposures are partly hedged by funding overseas subsidiaries with local currency borrowings.
The Group does not have any significant transactional currency exposures on financial assets and liabilities on which net currency gains and losses would be recognised in the profit and loss account.
