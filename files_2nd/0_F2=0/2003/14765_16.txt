Pension costs The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benets FRS17 was issued in November 2000 and the transitional disclosures required by that standard, to the extent not covered in a, are set out in b below.
a The Group operates pension schemes which the majority of its UK employees are eligible to join.
The principal scheme, the St Ives Pension Scheme the scheme, is of the dened benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The scheme was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002, but benets continue to accrue for existing active members.
A dened contribution scheme has been established for joiners after 6 April 2002, to which the Group contributes at the rate of 4 per cent of pensionable pay.
The pension cost for the Groups UK schemes was 3,757,000 2002 4,120,000.
The triennial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2002, using the projected unit method, by Jonathan Punter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, Punter Southall & Co Ltd the schemes actuary, who is independent of the Group.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the purposes of both SSAP24 and determining the funding rate in the valuation were: a long term interest rate investment return of 7.0 per cent per annum before Normal Retirement Age NRA and 6.0 per cent after NRA: salary increases of 3.5 per cent per annum and limited price indexation of 2.5 per cent per annum.
Pension increases were allowed for in accordance with the rules of the scheme and past practice.
At the valuation date, the actuarial value of the assets on this basis was sufficient to cover 88 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members equivalent to a deficit of 12.6 million.
The market value of the schemes assets as at 6 April 2002 was 98.6 million.
For the purpose of the actuarial valuation, assets were taken at 97.7 per cent of the market value.
36 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2003 The schemes actuary recommended that the contribution rate of 8.25 per cent of pensionable pay was appropriate.
This recommendation was accepted by the Company and the Trustee.
A creditor of 186,000 2002 86,000, inclusive of interest accrued, is included in respect of the dened benefit schemes.
The pension cost relating to foreign schemes was 1,165,000 2002 1,188,000.
The foreign schemes are dened contribution schemes and are principally Section 401 k Plans in the USA.
b The FRS17 disclosures below have been based on the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 6 April 2002 adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by FRS17 and updated to 1 August 2003 by the schemes actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 1 August 2003 2 August 2002 3 August 2001 % per annum % per annum % per annum Rate of increase in salaries 3.6% 3.5% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.6% 2.5% 3.0% Discount rate 5.5% 5.9% 6.0% Ination assumption 2.6% 2.5% 3.0% The FRS17 assumptions are similar to those used for funding and the SSAP24 disclosures, except for the lower investment return assumption discount rate used of 5.5 per cent which is based on corporate bond yields.
This has the effect of increasing the value placed on the liabilities and thereby increases the deficit disclosed.
The higher investment return used for funding and SSAP24 purposes reects the higher return expected in the long term by investing in asset classes other than corporate bonds, in particular equities.
The assets, the expected rates of return on the assets and the liabilities of the scheme were: Long term Long term Long term rate of return rate of return rate of return expected at Value at expected at Value at expected at Value at 1 August 2003 1 August 2003 2 August 2002 2 August 2002 3 August 2001 3 August 2001 per annum 000 per annum 000 per annum 000 Equities 7.0% 58,224 7.0% 57,462 7.0% 66,776 Bonds 5.2% 34,384 5.7% 25,357 5.8% 24,613 Other 4.8% 2,377 5.0% 3,125 5.0% 1,765 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Total market value of assets 94,985 85,944 93,154 Actuarial value of liability 156,753 123,507 107,667 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf deficit in the scheme 61,768 37,563 14,513 Related deferred tax asset 18,530 11,269 4,354 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net pension liability 43,238 26,294 10,159 aaaasdf aaaasdf aaaasdf 37 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2003 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continuedC HAIRMAN S S TATEMENT continued 4.
Information regarding employees, directors and pension costs continued The effect on the Groups profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses in respect of the Groups UK schemes, had FRS17 been adopted during the year, would have been as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit: Current service cost 4,289 4,468 Past service cost aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Total operating charge 4,289 4,468 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Analysis of the amount charged to other finance costs: Expected return on pension scheme assets 5,725 6,192 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 7,446 6,352 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net finance charge 1,721 160 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net charge to profit and loss account 6,010 4,628 aaaasdf aaaasdf Analysis of amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 1,431 20,711 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 5,344 1,064 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 15,001 2,647 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Actuarial loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 21,776 22,294 aaaasdf aaaasdf Movement in deficit during the year: deficit in the scheme at beginning of year 37,563 14,513 Movement in year: Current service cost 4,289 4,468 Contributions 3,581 3,872 Past service costs Other net finance charges 1,721 160 Actuarial loss 21,776 22,294 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf deficit in the scheme at end of year 61,768 37,563 aaaasdf aaaasdf 38 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2003 The actuarial valuation, adjusted for FRS17 and updated at 1 August 2003, showed a deficit of 61,768,000.
Contributions for the year of 3,581,000 were paid at the recommended rate of 8.25 per cent of pensionable pay.
Ordinarily the contribution rate would not be reviewed until the next formal valuation of the scheme, which is due no later than as at 6 April 2005.
However, in light of lower than expected investment returns the Company and the Trustee are reviewing the options for dealing with the growing deficit.
The scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2002.
As a result, the current service cost calculated using the projected unit method will increase over time expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay but will be applied to a shrinking pensionable payroll.
The effect on the Groups balance sheet, had FRS17 been adopted at the year end in respect of the Groups UK schemes, would have been as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Net assets: Net assets before pension liability 240,717 234,817 Net pension liability 43,238 26,294 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net assets after pension liability 197,479 208,523 aaaasdf aaaasdf Reserves: profit and loss reserve before pension liability 183,511 177,807 Net pension liability 43,238 26,294 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf profit and loss reserve after pension liability 140,273 151,513 aaaasdf aaaasdf 2003 2002 qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq 000 % 000 % History of experience gains and losses: Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount 1,431 20,711 Percentage of scheme assets 2 24 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount 5,344 1,064 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 3 1 Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount 21,776 22,294 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 14 18 39 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2003 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continuedC HAIRMAN S S TATEMENT continued 5.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profits after taxation as disclosed in the profit and loss account of 22,483,000 2002 15,827,000.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by adding back exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, as adjusted for taxation, to the profit after taxation.
Basic earnings per share and adjusted basic earnings per share are calculated on a weighted average of 103,062,130 2002 102,777,257 ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The 500,000 2002 nil EPP matching shares held on behalf of the Company have been excluded from the earnings per share calculation.
The calculation of the diluted earnings per share is based on profit after taxation as disclosed in the profit and loss account and on a diluted weighted average of 103,101,320 2002 103,011,170 shares during the year.
The difference between the number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation is 39,190 2002 233,913 representing dilutive share options held but not yet exercised.
Dilution has been restricted to share options where the individual option price is less than the average market value of shares during the year, which was 344.03p 2002 414.39p.

Derivatives and other financial instruments a Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and bank borrowings and generally maintains a positive net funds position.
Group policy is to manage exposure risk to interest rate uctuations with bank borrowings, predominantly short term, at oating rates with matching short term deposits of surplus funds.
b Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain exibility with respect to its liquidity position, by utilising short term cash deposits and where necessary short term bank borrowings for all working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
It is the Groups policy to utilise longer-term bank borrowings to finance acquisitions, thereby providing a hedge against net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
c Foreign currency risk The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate in the USA, Germany and Holland and whose revenues and expenses are denominated exclusively in the relevant foreign currencies.
In order to provide some protection to the Groups Sterling balance sheet from the movements in these foreign exchange rates, the Group may, if appropriate, finance a part of its net investment in these subsidiaries by means of overseas borrowings subject to the interest cost of those borrowings.
The extent of this nancing at 1 August 2003 was 35 per cent of the gross investment in foreign currencies.
