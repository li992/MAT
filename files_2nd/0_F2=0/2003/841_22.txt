Amec back WACE 4 1 04 4:44 PM Page 58 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985.
Full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement benefits is not mandatory.
The additional disclosures required during the transitional period have been included in note 30 to the accounts.
Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, SPIE S. A. SPIE was accounted for as a joint venture in accordance with FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures.
In accordance with FRS 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings, and in order to give a true and fair view, goodwill arising on the overall acquisition has been calculated as the difference, at the date of each purchase, between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the accounting prescribed by the Companies Act 1985, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between the cost and fair value of the net assets on the date SPIE became a subsidiary undertaking.
The accounting prescribed by the Companies Act 1985 would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the groups share of SPIE retained reserves during the period that it was a joint venture being recharacterised as goodwill.
The effect of this departure is to reduce the retained profit and loss account and capitalised goodwill by 14.9 million.
Basis of Consolidation The group accounts include the accounts of AMEC plc and all of its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year and the groups share of the results and net assets of joint ventures and associates, based on the gross equity and equity methods of accounting, respectively.
Joint arrangements, where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant and equipment mainly three to five years Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Trading results are translated at average rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward exchange contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken directly to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made post 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised, on a straight line basis, over its estimated useful life, which is not expected to exceed 20 years.
Where a business is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure includes any unamortised amount included within intangible assets.
As permitted by FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been written-off to reserves.
Where a business is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure includes the attributable amount of goodwill previously charged to reserves.
Interest Interest is written-off to the profit and loss account as incurred by all subsidiaries in the group.
The group has, however, investments in joint ventures which are involved in public private partnership projects to finance, design and build assets and operate them on behalf of the client.
In view of the nature of these projects, interest directly incurred in funding the construction programme is capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Long-Term Contracts Amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are stated at cost plus attributable profits, less provision for any known or anticipated losses and payments on account, and are included in debtors.
Payments on account in excess of amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are included in creditors.
Pensions Contributions to defined benefit schemes are allocated to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the normal expected service lives of employees.
Contributions to money purchase schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.
Share Option Schemes No charge is made to the profit and loss account in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all, or substantially all, UK employees.
Included within other investments are shares in the company held by the AMEC plc Employee Share Trust.
This is a discretionary trust, established for the benefit of AMEC employees, the trustee of which is an independent trustee company which retains legal responsibility, control and ownership of these shares.

Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Turnover Turnover represents sales and value of work done excluding all internal transactions within the group.
Corporate costs comprise the costs of operating the head office of AMEC plc and also certain regional overheads.
These are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
AMEC plc Annual Report 2003 59 Amec back WACE 4 1 04 4:56 PM Page 60 Notes to the Accounts continued 2 Segmental Analyses continued The financing of the groups activities is undertaken at a head office level and consequently net interest payable cannot be analysed segmentally.
Due to the nature of the businesses acquired, goodwill amortisation capitalised cannot be analysed segmentally.
The unallocated net assets liabilities principally comprise assets relating to the pension schemes prepayment and liabilities relating to dividends and taxation and are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
