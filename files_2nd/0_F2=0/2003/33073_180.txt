Until 2002 Unilever presented such collateral under cash on call and in hand and under bonds and other loans respectively.
Because, in normal circumstances, Unilever has to return the securities in the same form as the original security received, and Unilever does not retain the benefit of any dividends or interest on those securities, they are not presented as assets and liabilities of the Group.
As a result, both cash on call and in hand and bonds and other loans at 31 December 2002 have been reduced by 574 million.
