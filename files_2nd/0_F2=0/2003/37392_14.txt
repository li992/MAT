The assets of the plan are separate from those of the Group and are managed by Standard Life.
In France there are various elements to the pension arrangements.
Firstly, employees benefit from a government provided retirement plan, the cost of which is included within social security costs.
In addition, a number of employees receive retirement benets through a dened contribution pension plan.
Certain senior executives are also members of a separate dened contribution pension plan to which the Group contributes.
Most other Group companies have dened contribution pension plans, the forms and benets of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Non-cash share-based compensation is based on the difference between the exercise price of share options granted and the fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares at the date of grant.
As the options granted to date vest over three years, the difference is being taken to the profit and loss account as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
When an employee leaves before exercising their options, the expense recognised in respect of these options is reversed, resulting in a credit to the profit and loss account for that period.
