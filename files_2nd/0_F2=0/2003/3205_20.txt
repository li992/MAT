ii Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 65, based on eligible service to 31 December 2003.
Having considered external market practice and the retirement provision made within Centrica for other senior managers, the remuneration committee has agreed that the executive directors and certain other senior executives will be offered a one-off opportunity to leave the Centrica pension scheme and join the Centrica management pension scheme.
This offer is consistent with the historical treatment of the Centrica senior management population.
The Centrica management pension scheme has a normal retirement age of 62.
Individual accrual rates in respect of past and future service will be increased so that the pension expectations of individuals transferring across will be the same at the retirement age of 62 as they would have been had they retired at age 65.
Full details of the directors pension scheme arrangements can be found in the annual report.
