The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by independent actuaries as at 5 April 2001, using the projected unit method.
The actuaries reviewed the methods and assumptions underlying the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and, as in previous years, a valuation basis linked to market value was used to value investments.
The principal assumptions used at 5 April 2001 were as follows: Valuation discount rate pre-retirement 6.6% post-retirement 5.6% Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% Pension increases 2.4% At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 527.3m and the actuarial value of the assets was 117% of the value of accrued benefits after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The surplus of assets over past service liabilities is being used to suspend contributions until the results of the next triennial actuarial valuation are known, subject to the continuing consent of the Trustee.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme will be as at 5 April 2004.
An amount of 6.3m 2002: 2.0m in respect of the UK defined benefit scheme is included in debtors falling due after more than one year.
This includes a 5.0m contribution to the UK defined benefit scheme made by the Group during the second half of the year.
The Group has also made provision for unfunded pensions for those Executive Directors whose benefits under the funded Scheme are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The pension cost for the year has been assessed as 0.2m 2002: 0.6m and the balance sheet liability at 30 April 2003 as 3.1m 2002: 3.4m.
In France the Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is fully funded through a segregated fund.
The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements within FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been calculated by qualified independent actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2001, updated to 30 April 2003.
The financial assumptions used were: 2003 2002 % per annum % per annum Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 4.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.5% 2.6% Inflation 2.5% 2.6% Discount rate 5.4% 5.9% The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return were: 2003 2002 Expected rates Expected rates of return Market value of return Market value %m %m Equities 7.2% 294.5 7.6% 348.9 Bonds, Gilts and Cash Weighted average 4.4% 132.4 5.2% 154.1 Total 426.9 503.0 The following amounts were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17: 2003 2002 m m Total market value of assets 426.9 503.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 560.9 513.5 Deficit in the scheme 134.0 10.5 Related deferred tax asset 40.2 3.2 Net pension liability 93.8 7.3 47 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2003 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 6 Pensions continued The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which due to the timescales covered may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and their fair value may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes liabilities is derived from cashflow projections over long term periods and thus is inherently uncertain.
If these amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss account reserve at 30 April 2003 would be as follows: 2003 2002 m m Net assets 472.9 438.9 SSAP 24 prepayments and liabilities 5.1 0.1 Pension liability 93.8 7.3 Net assets including pension liability 374.0 431.7 Profit and loss account reserve excluding pension liability 243.0 209.3 SSAP 24 prepayments and liabilities 5.1 0.1 Pension reserve 93.8 7.3 Profit and loss account reserve including pension liability 144.1 202.1 The amount chargeable to operating profit and finance income for the year ended 30 April 2003 had FRS 17 been operative is as follows: 2003 m Operating profit Current service cost 13.2 Past service cost 0.1 Total operating charge 13.3 Other finance income Expected return on pension scheme assets 34.4 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 30.1 Net return 4.3 The amount recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL had FRS 17 been operative is as follows: 2003 m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 102.5 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 12.5 Changes in assumptions underlying present value of scheme liabilities 29.5 Actuarial loss recognised in the STRGL 119.5 The movement in the pre-tax deficit during the year is as follows: m Deficit in scheme as at 1 May 2002 10.5 Current and past service cost 13.3 Contributions 5.0 Other finance income 4.3 Actuarial loss 119.5 Deficit in scheme at 30 April 2003 134.0 48 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2003 6 Pensions continued % of scheme 2003 assets liabilities m History of experience gains and losses Difference between expected and actual returns on scheme assets 24% 102.5 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities 2% 12.5 Total amount recognised in Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses as percentage of scheme liabilities 21% 119.5 7 Exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles 2003 2002 m m Net loss on sale of businesses 8.5 Impairment of tangible fixed assets and goodwill 32.4 Amortisation of intangibles see note 12 2.6 1.7 Amortisation of negative goodwill of associates 0.4 0.3 10.7 33.8 Tax on exceptional items 6.4 Total 10.7 27.4 The loss on sale of businesses in the current year includes 7.4m of goodwill previously written off to reserves see note 29.
Last year the Group carried out an extensive review of its operating assets, as a result of which a 32.4m impairment charge against the carrying value of tangible fixed assets and goodwill was charged in arriving at operating profit.
A substantial part of this charge related to the Groups Office Products Manufacturing business and the investment in Turkish corrugated packaging.

The number of shares excludes the weighted average number of the Companys own shares on the Groups balance sheet during the year see note 15 of 1.1m 2002: 0.7m.
The Directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted earnings per share, being the basic earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles, helps to explain the underlying performance of the Group.
A reconciliation of basic to adjusted earnings per share is as follows: 2003 2002 Pence Pence m per share m per share Basic earnings 47.1 14.7 17.4 5.4 Exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles after tax : Amortisation of intangibles, and goodwill relating to associates 2.2 0.7 1.4 0.4 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill 26.0 8.2 Net loss on sale of businesses 8.5 2.6 Adjusted earnings 57.8 18.0 44.8 14.0 50 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2003 11 Earnings per share continued In calculating diluted earnings per share there are no adjustments to earnings, but the weighted average number of shares denominator is adjusted as follows: Number of shares in issue 2003 2002 Millions Millions Basic weighted average 320.3 320.2 Potentially dilutive shares issuable under share option schemes 0.2 0.3 Estimated vesting of Long Term Incentive Plan shares 1.1 0.7 Diluted weighted average 321.6 321.2 12 Intangible assets Positive Negative Other goodwill goodwill intangibles Total m m m m Cost: At 1 May 2002 35.5 1.8 4.2 37.9 Arising on acquisitions see note 29 17.9 0.2 17.7 Transfer 7.5 7.5 Exchange differences 1.8 1.8 At 30 April 2003 47.7 2.0 11.7 57.4 Amortisation: At 1 May 2002 5.5 0.3 5.8 Amortisation charge for the year 2.1 0.1 0.6 2.6 Transfer 0.4 0.4 At 30 April 2003 7.2 0.1 1.3 8.4 Net book value: At 30 April 2003 40.5 1.9 10.4 49.0 At 30 April 2002 30.0 1.8 3.9 32.1 The goodwill arising on acquisitions in the financial year ended 30 April 2003 is being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associate undertakings is shown within fixed asset investments in note 15.
The amount arising on acquisitions includes an increase in goodwill of 3.4m relating to acquisitions completed in the previous year.
This mainly comprises an accrual for additional consideration which was contingent on the post acquisition profits of the business.
