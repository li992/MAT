The profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is $10,265 million $6,843 million.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, adjusted for the unwinding of the discount on the deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP, of $10,289 million $6,843 million.
The number of shares outstanding is adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee share options are converted into ordinary shares, and for the ordinary shares issuable, in three annual tranches, in respect of the TNK-BP joint venture.
In addition to basic earnings per share based on the historical cost profit for the year, a further measure, based on replacement cost profit before exceptional items, is provided as it is considered that this measure gives an indication of underlying performance.

39 Summary directors remuneration report This is a summary of the directors remuneration report which is set out on pages 106-115 of BP Annual Report and Accounts 2003, a copy of which shareholders may obtain, free of charge see page 45.
Part 1 Executive directors remuneration Dear Shareholder The remuneration committees well-defined policy of relating pay to the performance of the company continues to be central in determining the remuneration of the executive directors.
As is commented on in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2003, the company produced strong financial results in 2003 as well as excellent progress on the implementation of the companys strategic plans.
The outcome of the committees assessment for 2003 has therefore been an increase in the performance-related annual bonus and share element of the Executive Directors Incentive Plan, compared with the reductions in 2002.
Share option grants, made in February 2003, were maintained at the same level as 2002.
Salaries, other than for promotions, were increased by up to 5% mid-year to maintain our competitive position.
Further details on the above are set out in the committees report.
The independent process and advice the committee utilizes continue to give us confidence in our policy and its application.
We also value our dialogue with major shareholders.
During 2004, we will be conducting a comprehensive review of our plans and policies with an expectation of bringing new long-term plans to shareholders for approval in 2005 when our current Executive Directors Incentive Plan expires.
I am confident that our approach will continue to align executive directors remuneration with the interests of shareholders as well as retain and engage the world-class team of individuals we have leading the company.
