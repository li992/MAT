The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain assets.
These financial statements have been prepared having regard to Part VII, Chapter II of, and Schedule 9 to, the Companies Act 1985 in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards, and with the Statements of Recommended Practice issued by the British Bankers Association, except where noted in the financial statements below.
An outline of the creation of the Dual Listed Company structure is explained in the section headed an overview of Investecs dual listed companies structure as set out on pages 4 to 6.
Under UK GAAP the accounts of Investec plc and Investec Limited have been combined in accordance with S227 5 of the Companies Act 1985 on the grounds that they form a single economic entity.
The merger method of accounting has been used to account for the combination in accordance with the provisions of FRS 6 applying to group reconstructions, since the Dual Listed Company structure was brought into effect by fide-merging the existing Investec group into two sub-groups headed by Investec plc and Investec Limited by virtue of share for share transfers which did not alter the rights of existing shareholders or the interest of any minority.
The nature of the DLC merger has resulted in the inclusion of amounts attributable to the shareholders of both Investec plc and Investec Limited in capital and reserves on the balance sheet, and in attributable profit.
The effect of the DLC merger is that Investec plc and its subsidiaries and Investec Limited and its subsidiaries operate together as a single economic entity, with neither assuming a dominant role.
This is demonstrated by the following key features of the arrangements: The shareholders of Investec plc and Investec Limited have a common economic interest in both groups: The shareholders of Investec plc and Investec Limited take key decisions, including the election of directors, through a joint electoral procedure under which the shareholders of the two companies effectively vote on a joint basis: Investec plc and Investec Limited have a common Board of Directors, a unified management structure and joint objectives: and Dividends and capital distributions made by the two companies are equalised.
If either Investec plc or Investec Limited proposes to pay a dividend to its shareholders, then the other Company must pay a matching cash dividend of an equivalent amount per share to its shareholders.
If either Company is prohibited by law or is otherwise unable to declare, pay or otherwise make all or any portion of such a matching dividend, then Investec plc or Investec Limited will, so far as it is practicable to do so, enter into such transactions with each other as Boards agree to be necessary or desirable so as to enable both Companies to pay dividends as nearly as practicable at the same time.
Comparatives The information reflected for the prior year relates to Investec Limited formerly Investec Group Limited and its subsidiaries because prior to the implementation of the DLC structure, Investec Limited and its subsidiaries constituted the group.
The prior year figures have been extracted from the Accountants report included in the Preliminary Offering Circular, and have been adjusted for the following changes: The group changed its policy for the translation of intangible assets in respect of foreign entities.
These intangible assets are now translated at the closing exchange rate instead of the exchange rate at the date of acquisition.
The effect in UK GAAP of this change in policy is a decrease in goodwill as at 31 March 2002 by 66.3 million.
The difference in each case has been taken directly to foreign currency translation reserves, resulting in a decrease in ordinary shareholders funds as at 31 March 2002.
There is no effect on the tangible net asset value of the group Investec plc Annual Report 2003 231 Accounting policies During the year the group conducted a thorough evaluation of the funding costs of trading desks as a result of which interest charges were reallocated between trading and funding desks within the Treasury division.
Comparative figures have been restated to be consistent with this.
Basis of consolidation The group financial statements incorporate the financial results of Investec plc, Investec Limited and their subsidiary undertakings.
All subsidiaries in which the group holds more than one half of the voting rights or over which it exercises control are consolidated from the effective dates of acquisition and up to the effective dates of disposal.
In the case of Investec Bank Israel Limited, whose accounts are compiled to 31 December annually, the group uses interim management accounts, drawn up to 31 March to prepare the group financial statements at 31 March 2003.
Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the group exercises significant influence over their operating and financial policies, are treated as associates.
In the group accounts, associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated financial statements include the attributable share of the results and reserves of associated undertakings, based on financial statements made up to dates not earlier than three months prior to 31 March.
The groups interests in associated undertakings are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the groups share of net assets plus unamortised goodwill.
Positive goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is amortised against income over its useful economic life, a period not exceeding 20 years.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions is included within intangible fixed assets and released to profit and loss account initially over the period that non-monetary assets are recovered and then over the periods expected to benefit.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable In order to reflect the different nature of the shareholders and policyholders interests in the long-term assurance business, the value of the long-term assurance business attributable to shareholders and the assets and liabilities attributable to policyholders are classified under separate headings in the consolidated balance sheet.
The group operates various Employee Benefit Trusts.
In terms of UITF 13, the assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trusts are included within the group financial statements.
Foreign entities The net assets of the group undertakings and associates which do not have sterling as a functional currency are translated at closing rates of exchange and the translation differences arising are taken to reserves.
The results of these companies are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the relevant period.
The difference between the profit and loss translated at an average rate and the closing rate is recorded as a movement in reserves.
Any exchange differences on foreign currency loans, which are used to hedge the net investment in subsidiaries which do not have sterling as a functional currency, are also taken to reserves.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of entities that do not have sterling as a functional currency is translated at the closing exchange rate.
This is not consistent with prior years, as explained above.
Foreign currency transactions Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the local reporting currency at market rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All foreign currency transactions are translated into the local reporting currency at the exchange rates ruling at the time of the transactions.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Investec plc 232 Annual Report 2003 Accounting policies Debt securities and equity shares Shares and securities intended for use on a continuing basis in the groups activities are classified as investment securities.
Such shares and securities are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
The cost of dated investment securities is adjusted for the amortisation of premiums or discounts on a level yield basis over the period to maturity.
Debt securities held for the purpose of hedging are valued on the same basis as the liabilities which are being hedged.
Other debt securities and equity shares are included in the balance sheet at market value.
Changes in the market value of such assets are recognised in the profit and loss account as Dealing profits as they arise.
Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements are recorded as assets.
Obligations for the repurchase of these securities are included under deposits by banks and customer accounts.
Securities that are purchased under an agreement to resell the securities at a future date are included under loans and advances.
Stock borrowing and lending transactions that are not cash collateralised are not included in the balance sheet.
Financial instruments Financial instruments in the trading book are measured at fair value, whereas financial instruments in the nontrading book, including loans and investment securities, are measured at amortised cost.
Income and expenses on trading instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account in full in the current period, whereas income and expenses on non-trading instruments are amortised over the life of the instrument, with adjustments made to reflect changes in estimated premiums and discounts.
Derivatives Derivatives are used to hedge interest, exchange rate and equity exposures related to non-trading positions.
Instruments used for hedging purposes include swaps, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, forward rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments.
In addition, the use of derivatives and their sale to customers as risk management products is an integral part of the groups trading activities.
Derivatives entered into for trading purposes include swaps, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, commodity derivatives, forward rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments.
Where the group has entered into legally binding netting agreements, positive and negative values of derivatives are offset within the balance sheet totals.
Exposures to market risks are limited through the use of hedging instruments.
The criteria used for a derivative instrument to be classified as a designated hedge include: - the transaction must effectively reduce the price or interest rate or credit risk of the asset, liability or cashflow to which it is linked: and - adequate evidence of the intention to link with the underlying risk inherent in the asset, liability or cashflow: and - the transaction must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract.
The hedging instruments are accounted for on the same basis as the underlying asset, liability, position or cash flow being hedged with income and expense being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedging transactions which are superseded, cease to be effective or are terminated prior to the end of the life of the asset, liability or cashflow being hedged are measured at fair value.
Any profit or loss arising is deferred and amortised into income or expense over the remaining life of the item previously hedged.
When the underlying asset, liability position or cashflow is terminated prior to the hedging transaction, the hedging transaction is measured at fair value and the resulting profit or loss is included in the category of income or expense relating to the previously hedged transaction.
Investec plc Annual Report 2003 233 Accounting policies Instalment credit, leases and rental agreements Amounts outstanding on these contracts, net of unearned finance charges, are included in loans and advances.
Finance charges on finance leases and instalment credit transactions are credited to income in proportion to the capital balances outstanding.
Specific and general provisions for bad and doubtful debts Specific provisions represent the quantification of actual and expected losses from identified accounts and are deducted from loans and advances in the balance sheet.
The amount of specific provision raised is the groups conservative estimate of the amount needed to reduce the carrying value of the asset to the expected ultimate net realisable value, taking into account the financial status of the customer and any security for the loan.
Included in the specific provisions are amounts in respect of interest that is not serviced.
The charge for bad and doubtful debts in the income statement includes the unserviced interest which has been transferred to specific provisions.
Doubtful debts are written off against the balance sheet asset and provision in part, or in whole, when the extent of the loss incurred has been determined.
General provisions augment specific provisions and provide cover for loans which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which will not be identified as such until some time in the future.
The groups general provision has been determined taking into account the structure and the risk characteristics of the groups loan portfolio.
A number of complex and changing factors are collectively weighed by management in determining the adequacy of provisions.
These factors include managements view of the extent of existing risks in the loan portfolio and prevailing economic conditions.
General provisions are deducted from loans and advances to customers in the balance sheet.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at original cost.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over their anticipated useful lives.
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the shorter of 20 years and the remaining period of the leases.
The annual rates used to depreciate assets are as follows: Computer equipment 33% Motor vehicles 20% - 25% Equipment 20% Furniture and fittings 10% - 20% Freehold properties 2% The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Certain of the groups properties are held for long-term investment.
Investment properties are accounted for in accordance with SSAP 19, as follows: i investment properties are revalued semi-annually.
The surplus or deficit on revaluation is transferred to the revaluation reserve unless a deficit below original cost, or its reversal, on an individual investment property is expected to be permanent, in which case it is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year: and ii no depreciation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties or leasehold investment properties where the lease has over 20 years to run.
Although the Companies Act would normally require the systematic annual depreciation of fixed assets, the directors believe that the policy of not providing depreciation is necessary in order for the financial statements to give a true and fair view, since the current value of investment properties, and changes to that current value, are of prime importance rather than a calculation of systematic annual depreciation.
Depreciation is only one of the many factors reflected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been included cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Investec plc 234 Annual Report 2003 Accounting policies Dealing properties Dealing properties are included in other assets and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred taxation The directors have implemented FRS 19 on deferred taxation.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are the differences between the groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements, which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Long term life assurance 1 Investec Employee Benefits Investec Employee Benefits is engaged in writing long-term assurance business, including the provision of life assurance, pensions and annuities.
The company is structured into policyholders funds and a shareholders fund.
All premiums received, investment returns, claims and expenses, and changes in liabilities to policyholders are accounted for within the related long-term assurance fund.
Any surplus, which is determined annually by the Appointed Actuary after taking account of these items, may either be distributed between the shareholder and the policyholders according to a predetermined formula or retained within the long-term assurance fund.
The shareholder will also levy investment management and administration charges upon the long-term assurance fund.
The group accounts for its interest in long-term assurance business using the embedded value basis of accounting.
The value of the shareholders interest in the long-term assurance business the embedded value included in the groups balance sheet is an actuarially determined estimate of the economic value of the groups life assurance subsidiaries, excluding any value, which may be attributed to future new business.
The embedded value comprises the net tangible assets of the life assurance subsidiaries, including any surplus retained within the long-term assurance funds, which could be transferred to the shareholder, and the present value of the in-force business.
The value of the in-force business is calculated by projecting the future surpluses and other net cash flows attributable to the shareholder arising from business written by the balance sheet date, using appropriate economic and actuarial assumptions, and discounting the result at a rate which reflects the shareholders overall risk premium.
Changes in the embedded value, which are determined on a post-tax basis, are included in the profit and loss account.
The assets held within the long-term assurance funds are legally owned by the life assurance companies, however the shareholder will only benefit from ownership of these assets to the extent that surpluses are declared or from other cashflows attributable to the shareholder.
Reflecting the different nature of these assets, they are classified separately on the groups balance sheet as Long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders, with a corresponding liability to the policyholders also shown.
Investments held within the long-term assurance funds are included on the following basis: equity shares, debt securities and unit trusts are valued at market prices: investment properties are reflected at directors valuation, and loans are at cost less amounts written off.
Investec plc Annual Report 2003 235 Accounting policies 2 Investec Assurance The policy liabilities of Investec Assurance Limited comprise unit-linked business sold to retirement funds and individual investors.
All liabilities are directly related to asset values and the company assumes no mortality risk.
The liabilities are valued on a basis consistent with the asset values and comply with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis, as is accepted accounting practice in South Africa.
Investments are reflected at market value.
Where market value cannot be determined, investments are reflected at directors valuation.
Income from long term assurance business comprises interest, dividends and rental income received on investments held, as well as premium income in respect of linked business sold.
Gains and losses arising as result of the fluctuation in the market value of investments, whether realised or unrealised, are accounted for as movements in the long term assurance fund.
Income recognition Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account as it accrues other than interest the collectibility of which is considered doubtful which is credited to a suspense account and excluded from interest income.
The closing balance on the suspense account is netted in the balance sheet against accrued interest receivable or, as the case may be, the amount debited to the borrower.
Suspended interest is written off when there is no longer any realistic prospect of it being recovered.
Dealing profits are shown net of the funding cost of the underlying positions and includes the unrealised profits on trading portfolios, which are marked to market daily.
Commissions and fees include fees earned from providing advisory services, portfolio management and the arranging of financing for clients.
All such commissions and fees are recognised as revenue when the related services are performed.
Fees and commissions charged in lieu of interest are taken to income on a level yield basis over the period of the loan.
Equity investments received in lieu of corporate finance fees are included in trading securities and valued accordingly.
Other operating income includes realised profits and losses on disposal of investments, property rental income and dividends received.
Retirement benefits The group operates various defined contribution schemes and two closed defined benefit schemes.
In respect of the defined contribution scheme all employer contributions are charged to income, as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme, and included under staff costs.
The closed defined benefit scheme is closed to new membership and to accrual of pensionable service for existing members.
The pension cost relating to the closed UK defined benefit schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries so as to recognise the cost of pensions on a systematic basis over employees service lives.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the schemes.
Capital instruments Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits and if not they are included in shareholders funds.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.

In the view of the directors it would not be meaningful to provide this information by class of business since economic capital of certain significant businesses of the group is not held in, or allocated to, these businesses, but is held centrally.
As the business of the group is mainly that of banking and insurance, no segmental analysis of turnover is given.

Segmental analysis continued The Statement of Recommended Practice on Segmental Reporting by Banks recommends, inter alia, net assets to be disclosed by class of business and geographical segment.
In the view of the directors it would not be meaningful to provide this information by class of business since the economic capital of certain significant businesses of the group is not held in, or allocated to, these businesses, but is held centrally.
Similarly, an analysis by geographical segment would not be meaningful, because of the way in which the group has been structured and funded historically.
The Statement of Recommended Practice on Segmental Reporting by Banks and the Companies Act recommends the disclosure by geographical segment of gross Income, consisting of interest receivable, dividend income, fees and commissions receivable, dealing profits and other operating income.
In the view of the directors, interest receivable and fees and commissions receivable are monitored on a net basis and aggregate split of fees and commissions receivable and payable by geographical segment would not provide meaningful disclosure.
Consequently, Gross Income is not separately disclosed.
The Statement of Recommended Practice on segmental Reporting by banks recommends that the geographical analysis be based on the location of the office at which the transaction was recorded or the location of the customer.
The group geographical analysis is based on the location of the office at which the transaction was recorded, except for the traded endowment business.
Although the traded endowment business is conducted and recorded in the United Kingdom, it has been allocated to the South African segment as the business is held by Investec Limited and managed as part of the South African operations.

The majority of the schemes are defined contribution schemes, with the exception of the Guinness Mahon Pension Scheme GM Scheme and the Investec Asset Management Pension scheme IAM Scheme.
The GM Scheme, which is a non-contributory defined benefit scheme, was last valued as at 31 March 2002 by a qualified actuary.
Scheme assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The pension cost relating to the scheme was determined using the attained age method.
There were no unpaid contributions outstanding at the year end.
The major assumptions used were: Investment return 6.25% Rate of increase in salaries 4.50% Rate of increase in pensions in payment for pre 1997 pension 2.00% Rate of increase in pensions in payment for post 1997 pension 3.00% The market value of the schemes assets as at 31 March 2002 was 70 124 000 and the actuarial value of those assets represented 102.9% of the value of the liabilities in respect of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for future increases in earnings.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the IAM Scheme, which is also a non-contributory defined benefit scheme, was carried out as at 31 March 2000.
The market value of the schemes assets as at 31 March 2000 was 7 920 000 and the actuarial value of those assets represented 110% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The actuarial valuation of both Schemes was re-performed at 31 March 2003 by independent qualified actuaries using the following assumptions consistent with FRS17.

Non-operational exceptional items 2003 Losses of 28.5million in respect of the disposal and termination of the substantial components of the US operations.
Profit of 5.8m on the termination of Securities Investment Bank Limited.
Costs of 6.1m relating to the fundamental reorganisation and restructuring of business units within the group.
No tax credit is attributable to this cost in the year as the group has not recognised a deferred tax asset for all of its losses in the year due to the level of total deferred tax asset compared to forecast profit in the legal entities in which the tax losses reside.
These unrecognised losses have been treated as attributable to the reorganisation and restructuring costs.
2002 Losses of 7.1m in respect of the pending disposal of the US private client operations.
Deferred tax of 2.7m was credited to the profit and loss account relating to the write down.
Costs of 11.8m relating to the fundamental restructuring of the Fedsure business units acquired in June 2001.
Profit of 1.4m on disposal of the UK insurance business.

Called up share capital continued Staff Share Scheme The Bank operates a share option and a share purchase scheme for employees.
The number of ordinary shares conditionally allocated to employees are disclosed in note 22.
Movements in the number of share options issued for 1 share each, held by employees are as follows: Each option is in respect of one share.
Number Number Outstanding at 1 April 5 657 874 3 600 993 Issued during the year 10 667 827 2 715 853 Exercised 5 940 42 009 Lapsed 1 163 298 616 963 Outstanding at 31 March 15 156 463 5 657 874 The purpose of the Staff Share Scheme is to promote an esprit fide corps within the organisation, create an awareness of Investecs performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group.
The group makes shares or debentures available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the group and stock market conditions.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members a share allocation approximately equal to their annual package after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff, participants may not deal in any shares acquired in terms of the Scheme within two years of accepting them.
Thereafter they may acquire them over a minimum period of a further three years or maximum period of a further eight years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance, and contribution made by, the respective staff members.
In addition to the Staff Share Scheme, other incentive schemes are operated by the group.
Whilst the objectives of such schemes are identical to the Staff Share Scheme, membership of them is not extended to all staff members but to key members of the group whom executive management believe are in a position to add significant value to the group.
Whilst housed in different structures from the Staff Share Scheme, the underlying assets in them are group instruments.
Any benefit derived by the members from such schemes is thus totally dependent on the performance of the group.
The extent of the directors and staff interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on page 265.

All amounts are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair values of listed and publicly traded securities held for non-trading book purposes comprising debt securities and equity shares are disclosed under the relevant balance sheet note.
The fair values of other nontrading book balances approximate to their carrying value in the balance sheet where a liquid and active market exists as defined by FRS 13.
Derivatives off balance sheet financial instruments The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include financial futures options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
All interest rate contracts are transacted with other financial institutions.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables below, notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash flows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at balance sheet date.
Detailed below is the derivative exposure for both trading and non trading portfolios.

In these financial statements Investec plc and its subsidiaries are consolidated as foreign subsidiaries into the results of Investec Limited.
The equity of Investec plc has been shown in equity to reflect the economic interests of these external parties.
This approach has been adopted because a shareholder in Investec Limited participates in the economic results of both Investec Limited and Investec plc in terms of the DLC sharing arrangements.
The prior year figures presented are those of Investec Limited, previously Investec Group Limited, as the DLC sharing arrangements did not exist in the prior year.
As Investec plc and Investec Limited were formed out of Investec Group Limited, the comparative figures represent the activities of the group prior to the implementation the DLC structure.
Basis of preparation The annual financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, unless otherwise indicated, in conformity with South African Statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and the South African Companies Act of 1973.
In preparation of the consolidated financial statements uniform accounting policies have been applied throughout the group.
The following are the principal accounting policies, which, other than indicated in note 22, are consistent with those of the previous year.
The presentation currency is in Rand millions, unless otherwise indicated.
The functional currency of the Investec Limited group is Rands.
Basis of consolidation The annual financial statements incorporate the consolidated financial results of Investec Limited, Investec plc and their subsidiaries.
All entities in which the group holds more than one half of the voting rights or over which the group has the ability to control are consolidated from the effective dates of acquisition up to the effective dates of disposal.
In the case of Investec Bank Israel Limited, whose accounts are compiled to 31 December annually, the group uses interim management accounts, drawn up to 31 March annually.
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits are eliminated on consolidation, except to the extent that unrealised losses represent an impairment of an asset transferred.
In order to reflect the different nature of the shareholders and policyholders interests in the long-term assurance business, the value of the long-term assurance business attributable to the shareholder and the assets and liabilities attributable to policyholders are classified separately in the consolidated balance sheet.
Investments in subsidiaries in the separate financial statements of the holding company are equity accounted, as described in the policy hereunder.
Accounting for associates Entities other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the group exercises a significant influence are treated as associates.
In the statutory and group accounts, associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Equity accounting involves recognising the attributable share of the results and reserves of associated undertakings, based on accounts made up to dates not earlier than six months prior to 31 March.
The groups interests in associated undertakings are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the groups share of net assets.
Goodwill relating to associates is included in goodwill on the balance sheet and amortised as detailed below.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the net assets arising out of business combinations at the date of acquisition including the acquisition of interests in subsidiaries or associates.
Investec Limited Annual Report 2003 329 Accounting policies Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairments.
The carrying amount is reviewed annually for impairment.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates is amortised to the income statement over its useful economic life, not exceeding 20 years.
Foreign entities Foreign entities are subsidiaries, with a functional currency other than Rand, the activities of which are not an integral part of those of the reporting entity.
The assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The translation differences arising are taken to reserves.
The results of foreign entities are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the relevant period.
Any exchange differences for foreign currency loans which are used to hedge the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are also taken to reserves.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of foreign entities is translated at the closing exchange rate.
This is not consistent with prior years, refer to changes in accounting policies.
Foreign operations Foreign operations are subsidiaries, with a functional currency other than Rand, the activities of which are an integral part of those of the reporting entity.
The monetary assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at rates of exchange ruling at balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at the historic rates at the time the asset was acquired or the liability incurred.
The results of foreign operations are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the relevant period.
The translation differences arising are included in income for the period.
Foreign currency transactions All foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the time of the transactions.
Any profit or loss arising from a change in exchange rates, affecting monetary items subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange profit or loss in the income statement.
Interest bearing securities Except for instruments held to maturity, interest bearing securities are marked to market and profits and losses recognised in the income statement.
Interest bearing securities held to maturity are carried at amortised cost, net of any impairment.
Obligations for the repurchase of these securities are included under deposits and other accounts.
Securities purchased under an agreement to resell the securities at a future date are reflected in the balance sheet as cash and short-term funds.
Stock borrowing and lending transactions that are not cash collateralised are not included in the balance sheet, but are disclosed as assets under administration.
Derivatives Derivatives entered into for trading purposes are measured at fair value.
Profits and losses arising on the mark to market of trading derivatives are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise, whereas income and expenses on hedging instruments are amortised over the life of the instrument, with adjustments made to reflect changes in estimated premiums and discounts.
Where the group has entered into legally binding netting agreements, related positive and negative values of derivatives are offset within the balance sheet totals.
Investec Limited 330 Annual Report 2003 Accounting policies Exposures to market risks are limited through the use of hedging instruments.
The criteria used for a derivative instrument to be classified as a designated hedge include: the transaction must effectively reduce the price or interest rate risk of the asset, liability or cashflow to which it is linked: and adequate evidence of the intention to link with the underlying risk inherent in the asset, liability or cashflow: and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract.
Hedging instruments are accounted for on the same basis as the underlying asset, liability or cash flow being hedged.
Hedging transactions that are superceded, cease to be effective or are terminated prior to maturity of the asset, liability, or cashflow being hedged are measured at fair value.
Any profit or loss arising from re-measurement is deferred and amortised to income over the remaining life of the item previously hedged.
When the underlying asset, liability or cashflow is terminated prior to the hedging transaction, the hedging instrument is re-measured at fair value and the resulting profit or loss is included in the category of income or expense relating to the previously hedged transaction.
Equity investments Equity investments are held either for trading or long-term investment purposes.
Investments are classified as trading when the intention is to sell the investment in usually a short period of time with the intention of realising a speculative profit.
Long-term investments are acquired because they are complimentary or directly related to the business undertaken by Investec.
Trading investments Listed equity investments are stated at market value at the financial year end.
Unlisted equity investments are stated at fair value.. Where there is no reliable basis to determine fair value, unlisted equity investments are stated at the lower of cost or directors valuation.
Profits and losses arising from the revaluation of trading investments are included in income.
Long-term investments The excess of market value of long-term investments over cost, determined on a portfolio basis, is taken to reserves, whilst any deficit arising is reflected in the income statement.
On disposal of such investments, the revaluation is reversed and the full difference between cost and the amount realised is shown in the income statement.
Other investments Other investments are valued at market value where a formal market exists or in the case of investments such as insurance policies or equity funds at the value of the underlying investments.
Where no formal market exists investments are valued at the lower of cost or directors valuation.
Instalment credit, leases and rental agreements Instalment credit, lease and rental agreements are regarded as financing transactions.
Amounts outstanding on these contracts, net of unearned finance charges, are included in advances.
Finance charges on instalment sale transactions are credited to income in proportion to the capital balances outstanding.
Finance lease income is credited to interest income according to the effective interest method.
Specific and general provisions for bad and doubtful debts Advances are stated after the deduction of specific and general provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Specific provisions represent the quantification of actual and expected losses from identified accounts and are deducted from advances in the balance sheet.
The amount of specific provision raised is the amount needed to reduce the carrying value of the asset to the expected ultimate net realisable value, taking into account the financial status of the customer and any security for the loan.
Included in the specific provisions are amounts in respect of Investec Limited Annual Report 2003 331 Accounting policies interest that is not serviced.
The charge for provision for bad and doubtful debts in the income statement includes the unserviced interest which has been transferred to specific provisions.
The groups general provision has been determined taking into account the structure and the risk characteristics of the groups loan portfolio and meets the minimum requirements of the banking regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
General provisions are deducted from advances in the balance sheet but, unlike specific provisions, are included in tier 2 capital when calculating the groups capital base for regulatory purposes.
Property and equipment Owner-occupied property and equipment is stated at amortised cost, less impairments.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to reduce their cost to their estimated residual value over their anticipated useful lives.
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the remaining period of the leases.
The annual rates used to depreciate assets are as follows: Computer equipment 33% Infrastructure 20% Motor vehicles 20% - 25% Office equipment 20% Furniture and fittings 10% - 20% Owner-occupied properties excluding any land element related thereto 2% Investment properties are properties held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation.
These properties are not depreciated but are revalued to their open market value and the aggregate surplus or deficit on revaluation is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year.
Trading properties Trading properties are properties held for the purpose of making a usually short-term speculative profit, and are included in investment and trading securities and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred taxation assets in respect of secondary taxation on companies are not recognised until such time as the credits are utilised by the company through the declaration of a dividend.
Impairments At each balance sheet date the group reviews the carrying value of assets for indication of impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined for any assets for which an indication of impairment is identified.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying value, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable value.
Impairment losses, to the extent that they do not represent a reversal of revaluation profits taken directly to equity, are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they are identified.
Reversal of impairment losses is recognised in income in the period in which the reversal is identified, to the extent that it was charged to the income statement.
Impairments that represent a reversal of revaluation profits taken to equity, are recognised directly in equity to the extent that such revaluation profits exist.
Investec Limited 332 Annual Report 2003 Accounting policies Trust and fiduciary activities The group acts as a trustee or in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding, placing or managing of assets for the account of and at the risk of clients.
As these are not assets of the group, they are not reflected on the balance sheet but are included at market value as part of assets under administration.
Any surplus, which is determined annually by the appointed actuary after taking into account these items, may either be distributed between the shareholder and the policyholders according to a predetermined formula or retained within the long-term assurance fund.
The different nature of these assets is reflected by classifying them separately on the groups balance sheet as Long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders, with a corresponding liability to the policyholders also shown.
Investments held within the long-term assurance funds are included on the following basis: equity shares, debt securities and unit trusts are valued in accordance with policy conditions at market prices: investment properties are reflected at fair value and mortgages and loans are at cost less amounts written off.
The net assets attributable to the shareholder are separately recognised on the groups balance sheet as Long-term assurance assets attributable to the shareholder.
Changes in the value of the long-term assurance business attributable to the shareholder, which are determined on a post-tax basis, are included in other income in the income statement.
For information purposes, the group discloses its interest in long-term assurance business using the embedded value basis of accounting.
The value of the shareholders interest in the long-term assurance business the embedded value, disclosed in the notes, is an actuarially determined estimate of the economic value of the groups life assurance subsidiaries, excluding any value, which may be attributed to future new business.
The embedded value is comprised of the net tangible assets of the life assurance subsidiaries, including any surplus retained within the long-term assurance funds, which could be transferred to the shareholder, and the present value of the in-force business.
2 Investec Assurance The policy liabilities of Investec Assurance Limited comprise unit-linked business sold to retirement funds and individual investors.
All liabilities are directly related to asset values and no mortality risk is assumed by the company.
The liabilities are valued on a basis consistent with the asset values and comply with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis.
The benefits for all policies are market related and the liabilities were taken to be the market value of the units allocated to policyholders.
Investec Limited Annual Report 2003 333 Accounting policies Investments are reflected at market value.

Net interest margin is determined after taking into account the bad and doubtful debts charge.
Other income Other income includes trading profits, commissions and fees, investment and life income.
Trading profits are shown net of the funding cost of the underlying positions and includes the unrealised profits on trading portfolios, which are marked to market daily.
Fees and commissions include fees earned from providing advisory services, portfolio management and the arranging of financing for clients.
All commissions and fees are recognised as income when the related services are performed.

For the majority of the acquisitions the goodwill is amortised over 5 to 10 years.
Goodwill impairment of R1 039 million arose as a result of the following:- - Following the disposal of elements of the operations of Investec Employee Benefits formerly Fedsure Life Insurance an impairment review was conducted using a combination of value in use and discounted cash flow valuations.
This resulted in an impairment of R619 million.
- With the discontinuance of the USA operations, the remaining goodwill was written off resulting in an impairment of R252 million.
- Securities Investment Bank ceased operating during the year and the remaining goodwill of R112 million was written off.
-With the downturn of the European economy an impairment review was conducted on goodwill relating to the groups Swiss operations.
This resulted in an impairment of R56 million on the Radcliffes operations.
9.2 Acquisitions and disposals The group did not make any major acquisitions or disposals in the current year.
- The goodwill arising on acquisitions is as a result of the group purchasing Intelligence at Work Pty Ltd and Provest Pty Ltd which resulted in an addition to goodwill of R8 million.

Assumptions The economic assumptions are based upon a long-term view of economic activity and are therefore not adjusted for market movements which are considered to be short term.
This approach is considered to be the most appropriate given the longterm nature of the portfolio of products.
The economic assumptions are derived by adding appropriate long term risk equity margins to the benchmark gilt ie R153.
The principal economic assumptions which have been used are as follows: %% Risk-adjusted discount rate 13.4 16.5 Return on equities gross of tax, 12.4 15.5 Return on fixed interest securities gross of tax 10.4 13.5 Return on property investments gross of tax 11.4 14.5 Return on cash held gross of tax 7.4 10.5 Investec Limited 346 Annual Report 2003 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March R millions 2003 2002 10.

Changes in accounting policies and other prior year adjustments During the year the group changed its accounting policies, applied retrospectively with respect to the following 22.1 Goodwill The group changed its policy for the translation of goodwill in respect of foreign entities.
Goodwill is now translated at the closing exchange rate instead of the exchange rate at the date of acquisition.
As a recent exposure draft issued by the International Accounting Standards Board proposes to make this accounting treatment mandatory, the group considers it appropriate to change the policy in the current period.
The effect of this change is an increase in goodwill at 31 March 2002 of R1 482 million.
The effect of the change is as follows:: Effect on income statement and reserves Amortisation of goodwill 115 Restatement of opening retained earnings 115 Restatement of foreign currency translation reserves 1 597 These are the statutory federal tax rates and therefore exclude state and local income taxes, which range from 7.3% to 9%.

This means that there is a one in 20 chance that daily losses will be at least as large as the reported VaR amount.
VaR, however, does not indicate how much the group can expect to lose in these cases.
Expected Tail Loss ETL quantifies the amount the group can expect to lose when the VaR threshold is exceeded.

Such principles vary in significant respects from those generally accepted in South Africa as presented in the results on pages 319 to 377.
Preparing the financial statements requires management to makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported results and disclosures.
Actual results could be different from those estimates.
The significant differences applicable to Investecs accounts during the period under review are summarised below.
At 31 March 000 Notes 2003 2002 Headline earnings under SA GAAP 1 100 650 109 540 UK GAAP adjustments Acquisition accounting 2 4 300 17 851 Employee share option plans 3 8 627 6 667 Accrual adjustments 4 2 581 870 Embedded value earnings 5 23 935 15 563 Other adjustments 1 012 2 728 Headline earnings under UK GAAP 82 611 115 777 Notes: 1.
The exchange rate used in the above reconciliation was based on the actual rates ruling on the date of the transactions.
The UK rules on acquisition accounting differ from the equivalent SA IAS rules.
The more material adjustments in this respect, in the current reporting period, relate to the following: Reorganisation costs relating to the acquisition of the financial and insurance businesses of Fedsure: under certain circumstances SA GAAP permits the acquirer upon making an acquisition to include a provision for restructuring the acquirees business as part of the fair value exercise.
Fair value provisions may be recognised even though the restructuring was not planned by the acquiree itself, when the acquirer has developed plans that relate to the acquirees business and an obligation comes into existence as a direct consequence of the acquisition.
UK GAAP does not permit provisions to be recognised at the date of acquisition if they result from the acquirers intentions or actions.
Acquisition of SIB Holdings Limited and the private equity assets of Global Capital Limited: these adjustments related to different rules with respect to the effective date of acquisition of the transactions and the fair value attributed to certain of the assets acquired.
Investec has issued Compulsorily Convertible Debentures, which under SA GAAP have been classified as shareholders equity.
UK GAAP requires capital instruments other than shares should be classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation or contingent obligation to transfer an economic benefit.
At the time that they were issued, certain of these instruments were split into their debt and equity components.
Under UK GAAP, the debt component has been recorded as a liability in the balance sheet and the equity component accounted for as shares to be issued within shareholders funds.
Accordingly, the interest payable on the debt portion has been split between interest and repayments of the principal.
This has the effect of reducing the interest charge on convertible debt under UK GAAP compared to SA GAAP.
Differences arising in accrual of certain income items e. g. income on certain trading related interest swaps was recognised up front under SA GAAP but is phased in over a period of time under UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP the shareholders interest in the in-force life assurance and fund pensions policies of the longterm assurance fund are valued at the net present value of the profits inherent in such policies embedded value.
Under SA GAAP the value of these profits is not recognised.
