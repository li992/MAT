The cash consideration received on the issue of Ordinary Shares during the year amounted to 1,437,000 2002: 26,168,000.
Non-equity share capital Deferred B Shares of Nominal 10p each Value Number 000 Authorised and issued At 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003 12,000,000 1,200 12 million Deferred A and 12 million Deferred B Shares were issued to Dr Gonella, the vendor of Jago, on 20 July 2000 under the Settlement Agreement that established the full and final settlement of the deferred consideration payable on the acquisition of Jago.
The holders of Deferred A and B Shares have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, no voting rights and on a winding up or other return of capital only receive the nominal value of their shares if the holders of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company have received the sum of 1 million per Ordinary Share and, as such, are classified as non-equity shares.
Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, following the US launch and first commercial sale of Paxil CR by GlaxoSmithKline in 2002, the 12 million Deferred A Shares were automatically converted into 12 million Ordinary Shares.
The 12 million Deferred B Shares automatically convert to 12 million Ordinary Shares on the Companys receipt of a royalty statement under the current Licence Agreement stating that reported sales of Paroxetine Paxil in combination with the Geomatrix technology have exceeded $1,000 million during any calendar period prior to 1 January 2006 or exceeded $337 million between 1 January 2006 and 3 May 2006.
In the event that this condition is not satisfied prior to 3 May 2006, the Deferred B Shares will not be converted and will be cancelled.
The vendor will not be entitled to any other nor additional compensation.
The Deferred A and B Shares were issued on 20 July 2000 when the price of an Ordinary Share was 94.25 pence.
The difference between the nominal value of the Deferred B Shares and their fair value, taken to be 94.25 pence, at issue has been recorded as non-equity share premium.
Warrants The Company has the following warrants outstanding: a D and E warrants The D and E Warrants were issued in March 2002 as part of the consideration for the agreement with Paul Capital to fund new product development.
The D and E Warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for a total of 5 million Ordinary Shares at any time during the period to 31 December 2008 at an exercise price of 73.75 pence per Ordinary Share.
A value of 0.3 million has been attributed to the D and E Warrants which has been recorded within Other Reserves.
b F warrants The F Warrants were issued in December 2003 as part of the 2.7 million $5 million loan with GE Capital Corp.
The F Warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for a total of 300,000 Ordinary Shares at any time until the repayment date of the loan at an exercise price of 1.20 per Ordinary Share.
A value of 39,000 has been attributed to the F Warrants which has been recorded within Other Reserves.
c Other warrants Warrants were issued in December 1999 as part of the acquisition of DepoTech and entitle the holders to subscribe for 291,777 Ordinary Shares at any time during the period beginning 31 December 1999 and ending on 25 February 2005 at an exercise price of $1.453 90.25 pence per Ordinary Share.
SkyePharma annual report 2003 22 Share capital continued Share options The Company encourages employee participation in its shares through ownership and continues to operate various Share Option Schemes and the Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Under the terms of these Schemes the Board may offer options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company to employees, including Directors, at a price not less than the higher of the nominal value and the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
Options granted to UK and European employees are only exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant, and are subject to the Companys Code of Conduct for dealing in Shares, and the Model Code.
Options granted to US employees prior to 2001 vest at 25% per annum from the date of grant and there were no performance criteria.
UK and European options granted prior to 2001 may only be exercised if the growth in the Companys share price over a consecutive three-year period exceeds the growth over the same period in the FT-SE All Share Index.
This criteria was satisfied for the first time in March 2000.
Employees with options that are within their exercise period are now able to exercise those options within any one-year period from the date the performance condition is satisfied.
Super Options are exercisable after five years and are subject to higher performance conditions in accordance with those recommended by the Association of British Insurers.
Following changes to the option plans approved at the Annual General Meeting in June 2001, options granted to Directors and senior employees since that date are subject to performance conditions linked to the total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies, and are not subject to retesting.
Options granted to other US employees continue to vest at 25% per annum with no performance criteria, and other European employees who are not Directors or senior employees can exercise their options after three years and are not subject to performance conditions.
The Groups plans are further detailed in the Remuneration Report.
The market value of Ordinary Shares during 2003 ranged from the lowest closing mid-price of 41.5 pence to the highest closing mid-price of 79.25 pence per share.

No provision for deferred consideration has been recognised as at 31 December 2003. b Paul Capital Royalty Acquisition Fund In March 2002 the Group announced a second transaction with Paul Capital Royalty Acquisition Fund under which SkyePharma will issue Ordinary Shares up to a value of $7.5 million if royalties and milestones received by SkyePharma in respect of those products included in the transaction are not in excess of minimum annual payments required to be made to Paul Capital.
During 2003 the royalties received by SkyePharma were substantially in excess of the minimum payments required to be made to Paul Capital, consequently the company has not provided for any additional obligations under this provision.

25 Financial instruments The Group holds financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage the currency risk that arises from these operations.
The Group finances its operations through a combination of equity, convertible bonds, bank loans and other borrowings.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding through a mixture of long-term debt and bank loans, raised to cover specific projects, and through the issue of shares to collaborative partners, where necessary, to finance development contracts.
Short-term flexibility is provided through the use of overdrafts.
The maturity profile of the Groups debt is set out below at note c. Foreign currency risk All of the Groups operations are based overseas in Continental Europe and North America giving rise to exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates notably the Swiss Franc, Euro, Swedish Krona, US Dollar and Canadian Dollar.
To minimise the impact of any fluctuations, the Groups policy has historically been to maintain natural hedges by relating the structure of borrowings to the trading cash flows that generate them.
Where subsidiaries are funded centrally, this is achieved by the use of long-term loans, the exchange differences on which are taken to reserves.
Where it has not been possible to use natural hedges, currency options, accrual forward options and forward currency contracts are used.
The Group has used these financial instruments during the year to minimise the currency exposure on operational transactions.
SkyePharma annual report 2003 76 77 notes to the financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group borrows at fixed and floating rates of interest as deemed appropriate for its circumstances.
Where necessary the Group uses several interest rate swaps to achieve the desired interest rate profile.
During the year the Group had several cancellable, floating rate, interest rate swaps on 30 million of the 6% convertible bond liability.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is set out in notes a and b respectively.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by third parties to financial instruments.
The Group does not expect any third parties to fail to meet their obligations given the policy of selecting only parties with high credit ratings and minimising its exposure to any one institution.
In the numerical disclosures that follow, short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly as a result of the Groups operations are excluded from all disclosures with the exception of note f on currency exposures.

The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet unrecognised and on-balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of hedges at the beginning and end of the year: 31 December 2003 Unrecognised Deferred Gains Losses Net total Gains Losses Net total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Gains losses on hedges at 1 January 2003 598 98 500 Changes in value from 1 January 2003 to settlement 6 85 91 Gains losses arising in previous years recognised in 2003 152 13 139 Gains losses not recognised in 2003 arising before 1 January 2003 452 452 Arising in 2003 59 39 98 Gains losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 393 39 354 At 31 December 2003, the Company had European style accrual forward options to purchase 142,000 of Sterling each week for the 4 weeks ending in January 2004, 22,000 of Euro each week for the 8 weeks ending in February 2004 and 123,000 of Swiss Francs each week for the 36 weeks ending in September 2004.
In addition, the Company had a cylinder structure containing knock ins to purchase 0.5 million of Swedish Krona each month for the 6 months ending in June 2004.
At 31 December 2003, the Company had forward currency contracts to purchase 4.6 million of Euro, 2.3 million of US dollars, 0.3 million of Swedish Krona and to sell 0.3 million of Swiss Francs.
The excess of fair values over book values for currency options shown in note 25 e represents the unrecognised hedging gain on these instruments as at 31 December 2003.
The actual gains or losses arising on these currency options will be dependent on future exchange rates and will be recognised in the profit and loss account, in 2004, as the operational transactions to which they are linked occur.
Unrecognised gains at 31 December 2003 include 0.3 million in relation to the cancellable swap agreement.
This is based upon the swap agreement continuing for the life of the convertible bond.
The Royal Bank of Scotland last exercised its right to cancel and replace the swap in November 2002, and it has remained in place since.

In August 2003 the company took occupation of the entire building under an eight-year tenancy agreement, at which time the annual rent was increased from $420,000 per annum to $720,000 per annum until August 2008, and $942,500 per annum from August 2008 to August 2011.
28 Acquisition of drug delivery business of Bioglan AB On 13 May 2002 SkyePharma acquired the entire drug delivery business of Bioglan AB, of Sweden, for 3.6 million in cash including acquisition costs and the assumption of 0.4 million of net liabilities.
The acquired rights include Bioglans Biosphere injectable technology and those rights to DermaStick, Crystalip and ES-Gel topical drug delivery technologies that remained with Bioglan after the January 2001 development and commercialisation licensing agreement.
The acquisition method was adopted and goodwill of 4.0 million arose on the acquisition.
By consideration of the likely commercial life of the technology acquired, the Directors determined that a suitable period over which to amortise the goodwill was 20 years.
