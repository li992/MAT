Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2003 1.
Principal accounting policies Basis of accounting The Accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and comply with all applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and reflect FRS 17, Retirement Benefits.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below and have been applied consistently.
Basis of consolidation The Group Accounts consolidate the Accounts of Scottish and Southern Energy plc and its subsidiary undertakings together with the Group's share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold are consolidated from the date of acquisition, or when control passed, using the acquisition method of accounting.
The Groups share of the results of joint ventures and associates are included using the equity method of accounting.
Turnover Turnover comprises sales of energy, including monies received from the balancing market in England and Wales and the value of goods, services and facilities provided during the year.
Turnover includes an estimate of the value of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
Recognition of profits on contracts Profit is taken on long-term contracts whilst the contract is in progress having regard to the proportion of the total contract which has been completed at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for foreseeable losses.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pensions i Defined Benefit Pension Schemes Pension scheme assets are measured using market values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Any increase in the present value of liabilities within the Groups defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet net of related deferred tax note 24. ii Defined Contribution Pension Schemes The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The amounts charged represent the contributions payable to the schemes in the year note 24.
Derivatives and financial instruments The Group uses a range of derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Interest rate swap agreements, used to manage the Group's interest charge, are carried at cost.
Interest receipts and payments are accrued to match the net income or cost with the related finance expense.
No amounts are recognised in respect of future periods.
Gains and losses on early termination of interest rate swaps or repayment of borrowings are taken to the profit and loss account.
Interest Interest on the funding attributable to major capital projects is capitalised during the period of construction and written off as part of the total cost over the operational life of the asset.
The issue costs and interest payable on bonds are charged to the profit and loss account at a constant rate over the life of the bond.
All other interest payable and receivable is reflected in the profit and loss account as it arises.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets Heritable and freehold land is not depreciated.
The Group is obliged under the Reservoirs Act 1975 to maintain its hydro infrastructure network, including its dams, tunnels and other hydro civil engineering structures.
This network is maintained in good repair and is therefore considered to have an indefinite life.
Expenditure to maintain the hydro generation infrastructure is dealt with using renewals accounting, and the annualised planned expenditure to maintain the operating capacity of this infrastructure is charged as depreciation to the profit and loss account.
The actual maintenance expenditure incurred is capitalised.
Cyclical maintenance on hydro civil assets of a longer life nature is capitalised and depreciated over the anticipated useful life of the refurbishment.
Scottish and Southern Energy plc 25 Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2003 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets to write off cost, less residual values, on a straight line basis over their estimated operational lives.
The estimated operational lives are as follows: Years Power stations 20 to 60 Overhead lines and gas storage facilities 40 to 80 Other transmission and distribution buildings, plant and equipment 10 to 45 Shop refurbishment, fixtures, equipment, vehicles and mobile plant 3 to 10 Leased assets Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Stocks and work in progress Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The valuation of work in progress is based on the cost of labour, plus appropriate overheads and the cost of materials.
Progress invoices are deducted in arriving at the amounts stated.
Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, subject to certain exceptions.
Deferred tax is calculated on a discounted basis and the net present value of the deferred tax liability is reflected in the accounts.
Customer contributions and capital grants Customer contributions, with the exception of those received for the contestable part of new connections work, and capital grants are recorded as deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the estimated life used in calculating contributions.
Goodwill Since 1 April 1998, any purchased goodwill has been capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis to the profit and loss account.
This is normally over a period of up to 20 years from the date of acquisition, with the exception of goodwill relating to the acquisition of Hornsea, which is amortised over a period of 30 years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions purchased prior to 1 April 1998 was written-off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, any attributable goodwill will be included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Turnover and profit analysis All turnover and profit before taxation arise from operations within Great Britain and Ireland.
The Group's principal business is the generation, distribution and supply of electricity and sale of gas in Great Britain and Ireland and the transmission of electricity in the north of Scotland.
