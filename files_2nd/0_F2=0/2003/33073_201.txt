i During the year ended 31 December 2002, Unilever recognised for US GAAP reporting purposes SFAS 142 which ceased amortisation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Amortisation expense on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on a US GAAP basis for the years ended 31 December 2001, 2000 and 1999 were 1 748 million, 810 million and 369 million respectively.
j During the year ended 31 December 2002, Unilever changed its method of calculating expected return on plan assets for US GAAP purposes by adopting the actual fair market value at the balance sheet date rather than a market-related value.
Had this methodology been applied in previous years, it would have resulted in an increase in net income for the years ended 31 December 2001, 2000 and 1999 of 86 million, 210 million and 57 million respectively.
