Pension Costs The Group operates several pension schemes.
The principal defined benefit schemes are the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme together, the Schemes, which are funded schemes.
These Schemes cover 89 per cent of the Groups pensionable employees in schemes providing defined benefits, based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the Schemes are held in Trust Funds which are independent of the Groups own assets.
In determining the level of contributions required to be made to the Schemes and the relevant charges to the Groups profit and loss account, the Group has been independently advised by Watson Wyatt LLP, Actuaries and Consultants.
The most recently published formal valuations of the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme were carried out as at 31 March 2003 and 31 December 2001, respectively.
The financial assumptions are derived based upon the economic conditions prevailing at the date of valuation.
The different assumptions between the two Schemes are as a consequence of their differing valuation dates.
The main financial assumptions adopted for these calculations were as follows: Bank of Scotland Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme Rates per annum Rates per annum Future price inflation 2.50 per cent 2.50 per cent Return on new investments 6.75 per cent 6.60 per cent Return on existing investments 7.10 per cent 6.00 per cent 1 3 Increases in earnings 3.50 per cent 3.50 per cent 2 4 Increases in pensions 3.25 per cent 2.50 per cent Notes: 1 In addition to the general assumed rate of salary increases, there is a separate assumed salary scale of increases due to promotions and increasing seniority.
2 The pension increase is on the excess over the Guaranteed Minimum Pension.
3 This assumption applies for the first five years and thereafter 4% pa is assumed.
4 The pension increase assumption reflects the guaranteed minimum increase of 3% pa applying in the Halifax Retirement Fund.
The pension costs for accounting purposes have been calculated using the same assumptions as those adopted for the formal valuations with the exception that note 3 above does not apply.
The following disclosures are based on these assumptions using the projected unit method of valuation: Bank of Scotland Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme Effective date of valuation 31 3 2003 31 12 2001 Market value of assets 1,339m 1,409m Asset cover level 85 per cent 98 per cent Regular pension charge 15.0 per cent 15.9 per cent as a percentage of pensionable salaries This charge will reduce to 12.9% from April 2004 following a change to the scheme rules to remove a 3% pa minimum pension increase.
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 85 Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 8.
Pension Costs continued The asset cover levels disclosed in the previous table represent the ratios of the respective Schemes assets to the value of the benefits that had accrued to members and pensioners at the valuation dates after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pensions.
The regular pension charges have been adjusted by spreading surplus assets or shortfalls in each of the Schemes over the average future working lifetimes of the memberships 15 years for the Halifax Retirement Fund and 16 years for the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme by fixed capital instalments plus interest on the reducing balances.
These elements, together with interest on the opening balance sheet positions result in a charge of 74 million 2002 12 million in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and 56 million 2002 54 million in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme.
Included within the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme charge is an exceptional charge of 1 million 2002 1 million.
The increase in the current pension cost for the Halifax Retirement Fund reflects the formal triennial valuation at 31 March 2003.
Contributions to the Schemes of 138 million were paid over the period.
As contributions differed from the amount charged in the Profit and Loss Account a pension prepayment of 36 million 2002 35 million in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and a provision of 75 million 2002 82 million for future contributions in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme are included in the Balance Sheet.
This leads to an aggregate provision of 39 million 2002 47 million.
The Group currently contributes to the Halifax Retirement Fund at a rate of 15.1% of pensionable salaries, plus 0.3% of life assurance only members pensionable salaries plus additional lump sum payments of 2.5 million per month and to the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme at a rate of 16.6% of pensionable salaries.
The pension costs charged in the Profit and Loss Account include 26 million 2002 27 million relating to schemes other than the Schemes.
These costs are net of an amount of 6 million 2002 7 million in respect of The Equitable Pension and Life Assurance Scheme The Equitable Pension Scheme which The Equitable is obliged to reimburse to the Group.
Other Post-Retirement Benets The Group also provides post-retirement health care benefits and concessionary rate mortgages for certain pensioners and dependent spouses.
An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2003 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations at 40 million for the Group 2002 38 million.
The main additional financial assumption used was that over the long-term the rate of increase in health care costs would be 6.75% per annum, being 4.25% per annum higher than the rate of inflation.
The charge for the year ended 31 December 2003 for other post-retirement benefits was 3 million 2002 2 million.
Included in provisions for liabilities and charges is 37 million 2002 35 million which represents the accrued amount for other post-retirement benefits.
FRS 17 Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 the Group continues to account for retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 as detailed above.
The following additional disclosures under FRS 17 are required by way of narrative only.
The actuarial valuations used in assessing the FRS 17 disclosures are: the Halifax Retirement Fund valuation as at 31 March 2003 the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme valuation as at 31 December 2001 These are the principal schemes for the Group but additional FRS 17 disclosure has been provided for all other defined benefit schemes within the Group.
These are detailed below under the heading Other Schemes.
For the Schemes and Other Schemes, each actuarial valuation is updated by qualified actuaries, principally Watson Wyatt LLP, to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 and to assess the assets and liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.
The liabilities of the Schemes and Other Schemes under FRS 17 were calculated using the Projected Unit method using the following financial assumptions: Rates per annum Rates per annum Rates per annum 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 Future price inflation 2.8 per cent 2.4 per cent 2.5 per cent Discount rate 5.6 per cent 5.8 per cent 6.0 per cent 1 Increases in earnings 3.8 per cent 3.4 per cent 3.5 per cent 2 Increases in pensions 2.8 per cent 2.4 per cent 2.5 per cent Notes: 1 In addition to the general assumed rate of salary increases, there is a separate assumed salary scale of increases due to promotions and increasing seniority.
Pensions which are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 3.0 per cent per annum have been assumed to increase at 3.25 per cent for the 2003 calculations 3.0 per cent for previous calculations.
The above rates apply to all Other Schemes with the exception of the schemes within Bank of Scotland Ireland Ltd, which are not significant.
The Schemes are closed to new entrants.
Under the Projected Unit method, the current service cost will increase as members of the Schemes approach retirement.

At 31 December 2003, under FRS 17, a deficit of 55 million 2002 51 million and a profit and loss charge of 22 million 2002 14 million would arise.
The Equitable is, however, obliged to reimburse the Group for certain excess costs of funding this scheme.
The contributions to Other Schemes referred to above are those paid by the Group and do not take account of amounts to be reimbursed by The Equitable.

Pension Costs continued Other Post-Retirement Benets An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2003 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations under FRS 17 at 44 million 2002 40 million for the Group.
There are no assets backing these obligations, and hence the notional balance sheet provision under FRS 17 is also 44 million 2002 40 million.
The notional charge in relation to these benefits amounted to 3 million 2002 3 million.
The main additional financial assumption used was that the long-term rate of increase in health care costs would be 5.6% per annum, which is in line with the discount rate.

Neither the Company nor its subsidiary undertakings are required to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders in accordance with the terms of the notes nor is it intended to do so.
Repayment of the non-recourse funding facilities will be made solely from the cashflows generated by the underlying loan portfolios.

Neither the Company nor its subsidiary undertakings have the right or obligation to repurchase any securitised advance unless it has been in breach of warranty.
HBOS Group undertakings and third parties have entered into a number of interest rate swaps with the securitisation undertakings, the intention of which is to swap all or part of the interest flows from customers into variable rate interest flows to match the variable rate interest payable to the noteholders.

Long-term Assurance Business The value of long-term assurance business comprises the surplus attributable to the Group, including minority interests, together with the net present value of in-force business.
This method is known as the embedded value approach.
The principal economic assumptions are reviewed annually and are as follows: 2003 2002 % % Risk discount rate net of tax 8.0 8.5 Return on equities net of tax credits 7.5 7.5 Return on Gilts gross of tax 5.0 5.0 Expense inflation 3.0 3.0 In-force business is defined as all live policies where the first premium has been paid.
For traditional with profits business, the surplus attributable to the Group equates to one ninth of the bonuses declared in any year.
The level of assumed future bonuses is calculated by projecting the portfolio of with profits business forward and applying reversionary and terminal bonus rates so as to exhaust the projected surplus of assets attributable to with profit policyholders.
For all other business, the entire surplus is attributable to the Group.
The income from long-term assurance business is calculated as follows: 2003 2002 million million Closing value of Groups interest in long-term assurance business including minority interests 3,950 3,544 Opening value of Groups interest in long-term assurance business including minority interests 3,544 3,065 Increase in value of long-term assurance business 406 479 Transfers from to long-term assurance business 16 309 Acquisitions 12 Income after tax from long-term assurance business 422 182 Tax relating to long-term assurance business Note 9 103 51 Income before tax from long-term assurance business 525 233 Income before tax from long-term assurance business may be analysed as follows: 2003 2002 million million Contribution from new business 162 120 Contribution from existing business 238 366 Investment earnings 99 69 Income before tax from long-term assurance business based on long-term assumptions 499 555 Changes to economic assumptions 72 90 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns 46 412 Income before tax from long-term assurance business 525 233 98 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Financial Statements 27.

These derivatives are included within investments above at market value.
In accordance with UITF 37 Purchase and sales of own shares, long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders have been reduced by 37 million 2002 restated 33 million in respect of a holding in HBOS plc shares within the policyholders fund.
Insurance companies and insurance groups report their income from long-term assurance business on the Modified Statutory Solvency Basis MSSB in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers which is only applicable to the accounts of such companies and groups.
Under this approach, the profit reported is the surplus or deficit calculated for statutory solvency purposes with prescribed adjustments to technical provisions and the deferral of certain costs of acquiring business.
The Groups income from long-term assurance business under this alternative basis is set out below: 2003 2002 million million Premiums 8,270 8,924 Investment income 655 1,139 Unrealised gains on investments 4,316 Other income 39 21 13,280 10,084 Claims 4,883 4,354 Change in technical provisions 6,831 1,546 Expenses 1,019 1,178 Unrealised losses on investments 4,814 Other charges 47 29 Tax attributable to long-term business 157 157 Transfer to from the fund for future appropriations 137 1,605 Balance on the technical account long-term business 206 75 Tax credit attributable to balance on the technical account long-term business 63 5 Unrealised losses on investments 50 Income in shareholders fund 35 44 Expenses in shareholders fund 41 19 Surplus deficit before tax from long-term assurance business on a modified statutory solvency basis 213 133 Tax 62 6 Surplus deficit after tax from long-term assurance business on a modified statutory solvency basis 151 139 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 99 Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 27.
