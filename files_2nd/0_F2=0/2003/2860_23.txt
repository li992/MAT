NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 46 Capita 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The accounts comply, to the extent detailed below, with the following new Financial Reporting Standards and Urgent Issues Task Force abstracts issued by the UK Accounting Standards Board.
FRS17 Retirement benets The Accounting Standards Board proposed in July 2002 to extend the transitional regime of FRS17, and the Group has decided not to adopt FRS17 in the financial statements for the current year and to continue to account for pensions under SSAP24.
Disclosures required under the transitional regime of FRS17 are included in note 26 to the accounts.
UITF37 Abstract Purchases and sales of own shares Changes to the Companies Act 1985 allow listed public companies, from December 2003, to purchase their own shares and hold them in treasury Treasury shares without cancelling them.
Previously UK company legislation did not permit a company to hold its own shares any shares purchased were cancelled.
The Company has decided to cancel shares that it repurchases, though it is considering retaining holdings of Treasury shares in the future.
UITF38 Accounting for ESOP trusts The Group has decided not to early adopt this abstract that deals with the recognition of investments in employee benefit trusts.
The investment held in The Capita Group Plc Long Term Investment Plan is held on the balance sheet as a xed asset investment and has been fully amortised.
International financial reporting standards The European Commission issued a regulation in 2002 requiring all listed companies to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards in their consolidated accounts by 2005.
The Group will be a first time adopter for its year ended 31 December 2005.
The Commission issued a recommendation in December 2003, to encourage companies to provide stakeholders with useful information in the transition phase from local accounting standards to international standards, this recommendation will be kept under review by the commission to ensure it reects further developments.
In this regard the Group gives below an indication of the steps being taken to manage the transition and information on the major differences that the Group has identied.
The Group is performing a review on an ongoing basis of the standards in issue and those to be issued under the new regime as well as looking at pronouncements from the European accountancy bodies.
The purpose is to identify implications on the presentation of information and on the accounting policies currently adopted by the Group.
This review will identify risk areas where current processes or systems may need to be rened or further ones adopted to ensure compliance.
In brief, those that have most relevence to the Group are: ED3 Business combinations and proposed amendments to IAS 36 The exposure draft deals with accounting for business combinations including goodwill and intangible assets.
The Groups current policy under UK GAAP, to amortise goodwill and to test for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable, will be replaced by an annual impairment test and cessation of goodwill amortisation.
IAS19 Employee benets The standard covers all forms of employee benefit, but the major impact for the Group will be in the accounting policies for post retirement benets in particular for dened benefit pension schemes.
The Group currently accounts for these schemes using SSAP24, and also complies with the transitional rules of FRS17.
Under SSAP24 variations in pension cost, which are identied as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees.
The new standard in common with FRS17 favours a market value approach.
Though where FRS17 requires immediate recognition of actuarial differences, IAS 19 allows differences to be deferred in certain circumstances.
The exposure draft deals with the valuation of share awards and their treatment in the financial statements.
At present no cost is recognised under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS2 transactions must be measured at fair value at grant date and that charge should be recognised over the vesting period.
IAS32 and 39 Financial instruments IAS32 deals with the disclosure of financial instruments and their classication as debt or equity.
IAS39 deals with recognition, fide-recognition, measurement and hedge accounting.
The Group believes that this standard should have a limited impact on its operations.
b Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and each of its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings are accounted for from the effective date of acquisition until the effective date of disposal.
Inter-company sales are eliminated on consolidation so that the Group accounts relate to external transactions only.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the parent undertaking only has not been presented as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
47 Capita Notes to the accounts c Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions made before 1 January 1998, which was previously transferred to a goodwill write-off reserve, has been eliminated against the merger reserve and the profit and loss account reserve and has not been reinstated on the implementation of FRS10.
If a subsidiary is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill that arose on the acquisition will be taken into account in determining the profit or loss arising.
Following the adoption of FRS10, goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or after 1 January 1998 is capitalised and classied as an asset on the balance sheet.
It is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, which ranges from 5 to 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
d Turnover Turnover represents fees invoiced in respect of services provided during the year stated net of value added taxation, except in respect of long-term contracts where turnover is described in e below.
Turnover was earned within the United Kingdom and Europe.
e Long-term contracts i Property consultancy contracts Turnover represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end.
profits are recognised on long-term contracts where the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
In calculating this the percentage of completion method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost.
Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays.
Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses are forecast.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less billed on account.
To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in creditors as payments on account.
ii Greeneld contracts A greeneld contract is one in which an entirely new service is being established for our customer.
To date this only includes contracts provided on behalf of the Criminal Records Bureau and Transport for London.
For greeneld contracts no profit is recognised until service commences and is being invoiced.
Until the commencement of operation the only turnover recognised is non-refundable milestone payments where applicable.
Upon commencement turnover represents fees invoiced in respect of services provided.
Direct incremental costs incurred on the contract prior to service commencement and reimbursable during the contract, excluding any overheads, are included in amounts recoverable under contracts and amortised over the life of the contract.
iii Browneld contracts Browneld contracts are where there is a transfer of an existing operation to Capita.
For browneld contracts all costs incurred prior to service commencement are expensed as incurred and turnover represents fees invoiced in respect of services provided.
f Tangible xed assets Costs incurred in establishing a new or changed operation, after contract award but before the delivery of outsourced services, that meet the criteria for recognition as tangible xed assets under FRS15 Tangible Fixed Assets are capitalised in tangible xed assets.
Such costs are amortised over the life of the asset, in order to match these costs against the associated contracted revenues.
Those costs that do not meet the criteria under FRS15 are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible xed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Computer equipment 3-10 years Furniture, xtures and equipment 4-5 years Leasehold improvements over the period of the lease Motor vehicles 3-5 years g Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost, less provisions for impairment.
The carrying value of xed assets investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
h Pension schemes The Group maintains a number of contracted-out money purchase schemes and contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are due.
In addition, the Group operates dened benefit pension schemes.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives within the Group.
Variations in pension cost, which are identied as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees in proportion to their expected payroll costs.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
i Leasing and hire purchase commitments Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
The finance charges under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals due under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
48 Capita Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued j Employee benefit Trust The shares in the Company held by the Employee benefit Trust are recorded in the balance sheet and are classied within xed assets.
The expected net cost of benets is charged against profits over the performance period during which the benets are earned by employees.
k Surplus properties The Group provides on a discounted basis for the future rent expense and related cost of leasehold property net of estimated sub-lease income where the space is vacant or currently not planned to be used for ongoing operations.
l Pre-contract costs Pre and post-contract award bidding costs are expensed as incurred.
m Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, taxation, with the following exceptions: provision is made for taxation on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of xed assets, and gains on disposal of xed assets that have been rolled over into replacements assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to taxation only where the replacement assets are sold provision is made for deferred taxation that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred taxation is measured on an undiscounted basis at the taxation rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on taxation rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
n Foreign currencies Company Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related investments.
Group The accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on consolidation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.
o National Insurance on share option gains National Insurance on outstanding share options at the year end has been grossed up and shown as a provision and a receivable on the balance sheet.
p Derivative instruments The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures.

Movements in the year are shown in note 21.
The bond issue was in the form of 55.0m sterling, and US Dollar amounts of $66.0m and $36.0m.
These issues mature on 20 June 2009, 20 June 2009, and 20 June 2012 and are issued at interest rates of 6.44%, 6.1% and 6.47% respectively.
The Group entered into cross currency swaps for the US dollar issue thereby converting the $66.0m and $36.0m bonds into a sterling denominated long term loan of 70.0m and an interest rate swap for the sterling issue, the maturity dates being the same as for the issues themselves.
Issue costs incurred were 0.5m and are being spread over the life of the Bonds to their maturity.
The effect of this interest rate swap is to convert the interest cost on the bond to 6 month LIBOR plus 1%.
21 Derivatives and other financial instruments It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged.
The disclosure below excludes short-term debtors and creditors.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bond issues, loan notes, finance leases, hire purchase contracts and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
a Interest rate risk The Group borrows at both xed and oating rates of interest.
After taking into account the interest rate swap and forward currency contracts entered into by the Group see note 20, the interest rate prole of the financial liabilities of the Group as at the year end was as follows: Weighted Financial Weighted average period liabilities Fixed rate average to maturity of on which no weighted period for non interest interest is average which rate bearing Floating rate Fixed rate payable Total interest rate is xed liabilities Financial liabilities m m m m % Years Years 31 December 2003 Sterling 124.633.57.1165.2422 31 December 2002 Sterling  61 Capita Notes to the accounts 21 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued a Interest rate risk continued The financial liabilities of the Group comprised: 2003 2002 m m Bank overdraft repayable on demand 1.0 Loan notes 33.0 34.1 Bonds 124.6 124.5 Obligations under finance leases 0.5 0.9 Other creditors falling due after more than one year 7.1 11.9 165.2 172.4 The bank overdraft bears interest at Barclays Bank standard rates based on the bank base rate and the bonds effectively bear interest at 6 month LIBOR plus 1% see note 20.
Loan notes issued during the year amounted to 1.7m 2002: 7.0m and 2.8m were repaid 2002: 23.1m.
The following loan notes are repayable on demand, but no later than dates of maturity that are, 0.4m on 30 June 2004, 5.0m on 5 May 2004, 4.0m on 30 June 2005 and 3.1m on 31 May 2007.
The remaining loan notes of value 20.5m are repayable in more than one year and are repayable on receipt of one years advance notication of the intent to redeem from either the loan note holder or the Company.
Consequently 20.5m of the loan notes are repayable in more than one year.
The interest rates attributable to the loan notes are xed for each new issue.
These rates range from 3.45% to 5.25%.

b Foreign currency risk During the year the Group had investments in subsidiary undertakings in the Republic of Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic, which are affected by movements in the local currency sterling exchange rates.
However, as this does not signicantly affect the Group balance sheet the Group does not currently hedge this currency exposure and any exchange differences are taken directly to reserves and are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
At 31 December 2003 the companies based in Poland and the Czech Republic were not trading.
The Group does not have any significant currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
c Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans, bond issue, loan notes, finance leases and hire purchase contracts.
d Borrowing facilities At 31 December 2003 the Group had total borrowing facilities of 150m 2002: 150m, of which 125m was committed 2002: 125m.
At the year end the amount of the committed facility drawn down was 20m 2002: nil.

f Hedges The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk Currency exposure on US$ denominated bonds.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses and deferred gains and losses on financial instruments used for hedging are as follows: Gains Losses Total 2003 m m m Gains unrecognised at 31 December 2003 1.4 1.4 Losses deferred at 31 December 2003 3.5 3.5 1.4 3.5 2.1 Of which: Gains expected to be recognised in the profit and loss account in 2004 on the interest rate swap 0.2 0.2 Gains losses expected to be recognised in the profit and loss account in 2004 on the currency swap Gains included in the profit and loss account that arose in previous years 0.3 0.3 63 Capita Notes to the accounts 21 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued f Hedges continued Gains Losses Total 2002 m m m Gains unrecognised at 31 December 2002 2.7 2.7 Losses deferred at 31 December 2002 4.2 4.2 2.7 4.2 1.5 Of which: Gains expected to be recognised in the profit and loss account in 2003 on the interest rate swap 0.4 0.4 Gains losses expected to be recognised in the profit and loss account in 2003 on the currency swap Gains losses included in the profit and loss account that arose in previous years No gains losses, arising from previous years, are included in the profit and loss account in 2002 as the bonds were only issued in that year.

This had been provided and disclosed as deferred consideration payable in the comparative period.
The consideration was settled through the issue of 0.9m of loan notes in The Capita Group Plc, the payment of cash of 1.7m and the issue of shares see note 16.
Additionally 0.6m will remain accrued to cover liabilities still outstanding.
Northern Registrars Limited and Northern Administration Limited On 17 February 2003 the Group acquired Northern Registrars Limited and Northern Administration Limited for a cash consideration of 19.0m.
The Group acquired Intangible xed assets of 3.6m fair value nil, tangible xed assets of 0.7m fair value 0.5m, debtors of 1.4m fair value 1.2m, creditors, including taxation of 1.2m fair value 1.2m and cash in hand of 2.0m.
The unaudited management accounts for the period 1 December 2002 to the effective date of acquisition show profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 0.1m.
The audited financial statements for the year ended 30 November 2002 show a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 0.7m.
The subsidiary acquired during the year resulted in net operating activities inows of 1.3m for the Group and outows of 0.6m in respect of taxation.
The Group made further acquisitions in the year including, Aurora Corporate Services Limited, Aurora Corporate Leasing Limited and Capita Life & Pensions Services Ireland Limited formerly Prudential European Management Services Limited for an aggregate consideration of 9.7m, satisfied by cash of 8.9m including deferred consideration of 0.6m and the issue of 0.8m of loan notes.
The Group acquired xed assets of 0.8m fair value 0.7m, debtors of 1.4m fair value 1.4m and creditors, including taxation of 1.4m fair value 1.9m.
These other acquired businesses have been completely integrated within the existing businesses of the Group and consequently it is not possible to determine post acquisition results of the businesses.
The fair value adjustments reect the Groups estimate of the fair value of intangible assets and estimates of the recoverability of debtors and liabilities in respect of accruals.
Intangible xed assets relate to goodwill on the acquired companies balance sheets and hence are written off on acquisition.
There were no significant impacts on deferred taxation in relation to the fair value adjustments.
25 Related party transactions There were no related party transactions that require disclosure in the year.
65 Capita Notes to the accounts 26 Pension commitments The Group operates both dened benefit and dened contribution pension schemes.
These pensions schemes are funded and the payment of contributions are made to separately administered trust funds.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from the Group.
The pension charge for the dened contribution pension schemes for the year is 6.0m 2002: 4.9m.
The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year end are 0.6m 2002: 0.9m.
In 2002, there were three dened benefit schemes: The Capita Pension and Life Assurance Scheme Capita scheme : The McLaren Dick and Company Limited Pension and Assurance Scheme McLaren scheme : and The Eastgate Assistance Retirement benefit Scheme Eastgate scheme.
On 30 April 2003 the Capita scheme and the McLaren scheme merged to form one combined scheme Capita scheme.
Accordingly, the comparatives relate to the combined Capita scheme.
The pension costs for the dened benefit schemes are determined with the advice of independent qualied actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The independent qualied scheme actuaries carried out the latest full valuation of the Capita scheme on 6 April 2002 market value of assets 54.5m, the McLaren scheme on 1 May 2002 market value of assets 89.1m, and the Eastgate scheme on 1 January 2003 market value of assets 6.4m and the Capita and Eastgate valuations were updated to 31 December 2003.
Surpluses or deficits on the pension schemes arising from the actuarial valuations are spread over the remaining average service lives of the members of the relevant scheme on a straight-line basis.
Included within prepayments are pre-paid pension costs of 2.7m 2002: 2.9m.
The pension charge for the dened benefit schemes for the year is 15.1m 2002: 11.4m.
The contributions made to the dened benefit pension scheme during the year amounted to 14.9m 2002: 11.0m of which 12.6m 2002: 9.0m was in respect of the Capita and Eastgate schemes.
The additional 2.3m 2002: 2.0m represents contributions made under admitted body status to our customers dened benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year end were 1.5m 2002: 1.3m.
The current agreed employer contribution rates equate to an average of 15.9% of pensionable salaries plus additional annual contributions amounting to 2.1m, rising at an average of 3% per annum until 2017 Capita scheme and 19.5 % of pensionable salaries plus 0.4m per annum Eastgate scheme.
The major assumptions for the last full valuations performed in 2002 and 2003 and used for the calculation of the profit and loss charge were as follows: Capita scheme McLaren scheme Eastgate scheme %%% Rate of return on investment before retirement 7.25 7.00 6.50 Rate of return on investment after retirement 5.75 5.50 5.00 Rate of price ination 2.75 2.75 2.50 Rate of salary increase 4.25 4.25 4.00 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.75 2.75 3.25 Based on the 2002 and 2003 full actuarial valuations, the value of the schemes was sufficient to cover approximately 95% Capita scheme, 90% McLaren scheme, and 67% Eastgate scheme of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries.
The results of the actuarial valuations also showed that the schemes were 109% Capita scheme, 99% McLaren scheme and 119% Eastgate scheme funded at the valuation date based on the methods and assumptions for the purposes of the minimum funding requirement MFR.
The market value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2003 are set out in the FRS17 disclosures below.
