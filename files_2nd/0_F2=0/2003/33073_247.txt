Dividends Our interim ordinary dividends are normally announced in November and paid in December.
Final ordinary dividends are normally proposed in February and, if approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meetings, paid in May or June.
The following tables show the dividends paid by NV and PLC for the last five years.
NV dividends are per 0.51 ordinary share and PLC dividends are per 1.4p ordinary share and per depositary receipt of 5.6p.
Dividends for NV have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of declaration.
Dividends for PLC up to and including the interim dividend for 2001 have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of payment of the sterling dividends.
Following a change in practice, starting with the final dividend for 2001, PLC dividends have been translated into US dollars at the rate prevailing on the date of declaration of the dividend.
The interim dividend is normally 35% of the previous years total normal dividend per share, based on the stronger of our two parent currencies over the first nine months of the year.
Equalisation of the interim dividend in the other currency takes place at the average exchange rate of the third quarter.
Equalisation of the final dividend takes place at the average exchange rate for the full year.
The dividend timetable for 2004 is shown on page 164.
