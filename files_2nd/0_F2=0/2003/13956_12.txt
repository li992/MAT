These share options are dilutive by reference to continuing operations and accordingly a diluted earnings loss per share has been calculated which has the impact of reducing the net earnings loss per ordinary share.
b The calculation of earnings loss per ordinary share, on a basis which excludes exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, is based on the following adjusted earnings: Continuing Discontinued Continuing Discontinued Continuing Discontinued operations operations Total operations operations Total operations operations Total 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 2001 2001 2001 m m m m m m m m m Profit loss for the financial year 475.0 7.6 482.6 214.0 1,201.1 987.1 151.2 156.3 307.5 Adjusting items exceptional items net of attributable taxation 26.0 1,292.1 1,318.1 74.8 74.8 goodwill amortisation 139.0 139.0 146.6 2.4 149.0 125.2 2.4 127.6 Adjusted earnings 614.0 7.6 621.6 386.6 93.4 480.0 351.2 158.7 509.9 The groups net interest and similar charges have been allocated between continuing and discontinued operations on the basis of external and internal borrowings of the respective operations.
The groups tax charge has been allocated between continuing and discontinued operations based on the profit loss before tax of the respective operations.
ScottishPower management assess the performance of the group by adjusting earnings per share, calculated in accordance with FRS 14, to exclude items they consider to be non-recurring or non-operational in nature.
Management believes that the exclusion of such items provides a better comparison of business performance.
Consequently, an adjusted earnings per share figure is presented for all years.
