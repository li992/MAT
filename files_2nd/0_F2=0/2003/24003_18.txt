UK Capital Gains Tax CGT An approved investment trust does not pay tax on capital gains.
UK resident individuals may realise net capital gains of up to 7,900 in the tax year ended 5 April 2004 without incurring any tax liability.
Up to April 1998, the cost of investments for CGT purposes was adjusted to allow for inflation between the month of acquisition and the month of disposal of the investments.
For investments held at 6 April 1998 and disposed of after that date, this indexation allowance will be computed for the period from the date of acquisition to April 1998, with taper relief applying after April 1998.
For assets acquired on or after 6 April 1998, only taper relief applies.
The taper reduces the amount of chargeable gain according to the number of complete years after 5 April 1998 for which the investment has been held.
