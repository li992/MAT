The interest rates on the majority of floating rate financial assets are based on local market rates.
The average interest rates for the financial assets of the group at 31 December, together with the period for which the rates were fixed, are as follows: 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 Average Average years Average years Average Average years Average years interest rate to maturity of to maturity of noninterest rate to maturity of to maturity of nonof fixed rate fixed rate interest bearing of fixed rate fixed rate interest bearing assets assets financial assets assets assets financial assets % Yrs Yrs % Yrs Yrs Sterling 3.3 0.0 0.0 - - 0.0 US dollars - - 0.1 3.9 0.3 0.4 Japanese yen - - 0.0 - - - Euro 1.8 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.0 0.2 Norwegian kroner - - 0.0 - - - - - - Danish kroner - - - Swedish kronor - - - - - - Other currencies 2.4 0.0 0.0 3.8 0.0 0.0 2.2 0.0 0.0 3.3 0.1 0.1 50 Financial assets are analysed as follows: 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 Fixed Floating Non-interest Total Fixed rate Floating Non-interest Total rate rate bearing rate bearing m m m m m m m m Cash at bank and in hand 3 22 10 35 2 24 7 33 Short term deposits 1 19 7 27 - 5 17 22 Equity investments - - 10 10 - - 8 8 Other financial assets - - 1 1 1 - 4 5 4 41 28 73 3 29 36 68 Non-interest bearing short term deposits include 7m 2002 - 17m of unrealised gains on forward foreign exchange contracts.
In addition to the financial assets and liabilities, during 2003 the group held put options over Cimarron Software Inc and call options over Amersham Buchler GmbH & Co. KG and Oncura Inc which meet the definition of financial liabilities.
The group also held call options over shares in Cimarron Software Inc which meet the definition of financial assets.
The maximum aggregate cash payable under options is 4m 2002 - 44m and the maximum aggregate cash receivable under options is 20m 2002 - 15m.
Amershams interest in Cimarron Software Inc also meets the definition of a financial asset, since at the year end it is held with a view to resale: this interest was disposed on 2 February 2004 see note 36. c Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the groups financial liabilities at 31 December is analysed as follows: Bank loans Finance lease Unsecured Other financial Total and overdrafts obligations loan notes liabilities 31 December 2003 m m m m m Analysis by year of repayment Due within one year or on demand 15 - 93 - 108 Between one and two years 4 - 9 3 16 64 Between two and five years 59 1 - 4 In five years or more - 2 8 - 10 Due after more than one year 63 3 17 7 90 Total repayments 198 78 3 110 7 Bank loans Finance lease Unsecured Other financial Total and overdrafts obligations loan notes liabilities 31 December 2002 m m m m m Analysis by year of repayment Due within one year or on demand 16 - 2 2 20 Between one and two years 3 - 103 1 107 Between two and five years 65 1 10 7 83 In five years or more - 2 9 - 11 Due after more than one year 68 3 122 8 201 Total repayments 84 3 124 10 221 The group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to it at 31 December as follows: 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 m m Expiring between three years and four years 2002 - four and five years 362 404 51 d Currency risk exposure The following table shows the currency exposure of the net monetary assets and liabilities of group companies at 31 December.
The exposures arise where monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating company in which they are held.
The gains or losses on these monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in the profit and loss account.

The difference between carrying value and fair value is also considered to be immaterial for floating rate bank loans and finance lease obligations.
2 Equity investments represent equity holdings in trade investments.
The fair value of listed investments is equal to the year end market price.
3 Other financial assets include investments in unit trusts and capital funds, for which book value is not materially different to fair value.
52 4 Other financial liabilities largely comprise discounted deferred consideration on acquisitions, for which book value is not materially different to fair value.
5 The book value of the unsecured loan notes includes a fair value adjustment of 2m 2002 - 4m, that arose as a result of the acquisition of the notes at the time of the merger with Nycomed.
The fair value quoted at 31 December is based on the present value of future cash flows of the notes.

f Hedges As explained in the Financial review on page 9, the groups policy is to hedge exposures to interest rate risk and currency exposures using a variety of derivative financial instruments.
Gains and losses on these instruments are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Gains or losses on the fair value of financial instruments are classified as unrecognised where they have not yet been recorded in the financial statements.
Where gains or losses have crystallised, but are carried forward in the balance sheet pending their recognition in the profit and loss account in a future period, they are treated as deferred.
The following table analyses the movement in unrecognised and deferred gains or losses on hedge instruments during the year to 31 December 2003.

Financial commitments The group has commitments to make research and development milestone payments and payments under licence agreements to third parties subject to achievement of agreed stages of product development.
At 31 December 2003, the maximum amounts payable under these agreements was 21m 2002 - 10m.

Provisions for decommissioning and effluent costs relate to the costs, determined on a going concern basis, associated with decommissioning radioactive facilities and with the eventual disposal of the groups intermediate level waste which arises from operations.
Decommissioning costs will be incurred after the facilities are withdrawn from use in radioactive operations and extend out to 2037.
Total decommissioning and effluent costs to be incurred in the next 10 years amount to approximately 38m.
The provisions are based on the latest technical assessment of the process and methods likely to be used, and are stated at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 4%.
54 The cost of the decommissioning is estimated based on the latest technical assessments of the process and methods likely to be used in carrying out the decommissioning of the relevant facility.
For those sites where the assets are currently being used and are active, these assumptions are reviewed regularly by management and the provision is adjusted to reflect changes in assumptions over the life of the assets.
Whilst these assumptions reflect a high degree of uncertainty because they are looking at facts and circumstances well into the future, they are unlikely to result in a material change to either the balance sheet provision or profit and loss account charge.
However, when a decision is taken to exit a facility on a site, a more detailed cost estimate is prepared, and this is reviewed on an ongoing basis as the work progresses.
As a result of the technical uncertainties involved in carrying out the decommissioning work, it is possible that this process could result in a significant change in the overall decommissioning cost which would be reflected as an immediate charge to the profit and loss account.
The provisions for pensions and similar obligations primarily relate to pension schemes, details of which are given in note 29.
The 3m provision for disposal costs related to sale of businesses comprises 1m for the closure of the disease profiling project in 2001 and 2m for the disposal of Nycomed Pharma in 2001.
These provisions are for legal or constructive obligations arising from the sale of businesses and are expected to be incurred within the next five years.
Other provisions are principally insurance claims, warranties and costs associated with the restructuring of the Discovery Systems business.
The provision at 31 December 2003 of 25m 2002 - 25m is made up of 11m 2002 - nil relating to Discovery Systems restructuring, 6m 2002 - 8m relating to insurance reserves, 2m 2002 - 2m relating to warranties, nil 2002 - 4m relating to radiopharmaceutical rationalisation costs and 6m 2002 - 11m of legal and other provisions.
Deferred taxation Notes 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 Group Group Company Company m m m m Provision for deferred tax comprises: Accelerated capital allowances 29 22 13 7 Tax deductible goodwill 30 26 - - Capital gains held over 6 7 4 4 Unrealised stock profit 21 22 - - Other short term timing differences 7 4 3 3 37 29 14 8 16 Transfer to deferred taxation assets 31 33 - - 22 68 62 14 8 The group has a potential deferred tax asset of 29m 2002 - 29m in the US Biosciences business of which 8m 2002 - 9m has been recognised, based on future financial projections which forecast future taxable profits in excess of those arising from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities.
The remaining 21m 2002 - 20m is not recognised as there is insufficient evidence, at this time, that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the group has further unrecognised deferred tax assets of 13m 2002 - 14m arising in other territories.
These relate primarily to tax losses in those territories, and there is insufficient evidence, at this time, that these assets will be recoverable.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Acquisitions a Oncura Inc On 1 July 2003, Amersham Healths brachytherapy commercial operations and the urology business of Galil Medical Ltd were combined into a newly incorporated company named Oncura Inc, registered in the USA.
The net effect of the transaction was to dispose of a 25% interest in Amershams brachytherapy commercial operations in exchange for a 75% share in Galil Medicals urology business and 3m in cash.
55 The transaction has been accounted for in accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract UITF 31 Exchanges of businesses or other non-monetary assets for an interest in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate.
The realised gain on the disposal of the 25% interest was 3m, and an unrealised gain of 12m has, in accordance with UITF 31, been recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Amersham has accounted for its investment in Oncura Inc as a joint venture from 1 July 2003.
The goodwill arising on the combination has been included within the groups net investment in joint ventures, and is being amortised over 15 years from the date of the combination, reflecting the period over which the group expects to receive benefit from acquired patents and technology.
The values ascribed to the combined businesses, and the fair values recognised, are outlined below: Interest in balance Fair value Fair value sheet of acquired adjustment of balance sheet of business acquired business m m m Interest in business received in exchange Tangible fixed assets 2 - 2 Intangible fixed assets - 3 3 Net assets acquired 2 3 5 Fair value of interest in business contributed 15 Cash received 1 Deferred consideration receivable 2 Net fair value of consideration contributed 12 Acquisition expenses 1 Net consideration 13 Goodwill arising on acquisition 8 Interest in business disposed in exchange Cash received 1 Deferred consideration receivable 2 Fair value of interest in business received in exchange 12 Consideration received in exchange 15 Gain on exchange of interests 15 The net assets of the interest in the business exchanged were 0.3m which have been retained at book value.
The fair value adjustment relates to the recognition of an intangible asset relating to patented technology acquired.
b Other acquisitions On 20 June 2003, the group acquired a further 49% holding in Imaging Research Inc, taking its total holding to 100%.
Goodwill arising of 2m is being amortised over 8 years.
On 12 December 2003, the group acquired 70% of the share capital of Shanghai Kexing Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd, a company incorporated in the Peoples Republic of China.
Goodwill of 1m arose on the transaction, which is being amortised over 10 years.
The acquisition was made through a newly incorporated entity, Amersham NMP China Ltd, in which the group has a 60% interest with the remaining 40% interest owned by Nihon-Medi Physics Co Ltd in which the group has a 50% interest.
On 22 December 2003, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Syncor Radiofrmacos S. L. which owns a 70% interest in Syncor Unidad Central fide Radiofarmacia fide Galicia, and purchased the assets of Syncor-Caribe, a Puerto Rican partnership.
No goodwill arose on the transaction.
All transactions outlined above were accounted for using acquisition accounting.
The groups estimated useful lives for these acquisitions reflect the period over which the group expects to receive benefit based on acquired patents and technology.

Pensions UK schemes The company participates in a variety of pension arrangements on behalf of its UK employees.
The principal scheme is the Amersham Pension Scheme, which is a defined benefit arrangement, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
An actuarial valuation of this scheme as at 31 March 2003 was made by Watson Wyatt, an independent firm of actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The main assumptions adopted in that valuation for the purposes of the UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs were that over the long term the rate of return on investments would be 7.75% pa, the increase in pensionable pay 4.5% pa and pensions in payment 2.5% pa. On the basis of these assumptions the market value of the schemes assets as at 31 March 2003 represented 88% of the value of the benefits to members at that date including allowance for future salary and pension increases.
The market value of the schemes assets on 31 March 2003 was 172m.
The scheme is currently funded using assumptions which are more cautious than the best estimate assumptions used for SSAP24 purposes.
The pension cost in the companys financial statements and the associated amounts of prepayment are set out below: 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 m m Prepayment at start of year 11 9 Regular cost 7 10 Variation from regular cost 3 1 Contributions paid 10 11 Prepayment at end of year 11 11 Overseas schemes The group operates a number of pension schemes overseas, which have been developed in line with, and are funded under, local practices.
The principal overseas schemes are in the US, Norway and Sweden and are mainly of the defined benefit type funded via separately administered trusts or guaranteed by insurance policies.
The scheme in Sweden is an unfunded arrangement and there is an unfunded arrangement in Norway in addition to the funded scheme.
These are provided for in the group financial statements and secured on the ongoing business.
Watson Wyatt have prepared pension costs using actuarial valuations carried out in accordance with local requirements, for the purposes of group reporting under SSAP 24.
A surplus or deficit is amortised over the average remaining service lives of the relevant employees using the straight-line method.
The review was made as at 1 January 2003, using the projected unit method and using the following principal assumptions: US Norway Sweden % % % Return on investment 7.50 6.50 6.75 Increase in pensionable salary 4.50 3.50 4.00 Increase in pensions in payment - 2.00 2.50 60 The pension cost in the groups financial statements and associated amounts of provision are set out below, in aggregate, for these principal overseas funded and unfunded schemes.

In addition to the schemes included in the above analysis the group also operates defined benefit schemes in other territories, principally Japan and Germany.
FRS 17 In November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board published FRS 17 Retirement Benefits to replace the existing standard SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Although the new standard does not become mandatory until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, it sets down transitional arrangements which require footnote disclosures in the interim period up to full adoption.
The most recent actuarial valuations have been updated by Watson Wyatt to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2003.
For the principal overseas schemes this latest valuation was at 31 December 2002 including the US, Norway and Sweden.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2003.
The future agreed contribution rate for the UK scheme is currently 15.2%, rising to 21.2% from the beginning of January 2004.
