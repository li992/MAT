Accounting policies Accounting conventions The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of the basis of preparation used in order to present a true and fair view.
These differ in certain significant respects from accounting standards in the United States of America and a reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP is included in the Supplementary information for United States investors.
All principal subsidiary undertakings financial years are coterminous with those of mmO plc.
O Germany has been accounted for as a 2 2 subsidiary from February 2001.
Prior to this date O Germany had an accounting reference date of 31 December.
It has not been practicable 2 for O Germany to prepare audited carve-out financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2000 and consequently, the results presented 2 for the year ended 31 March 2001 include the Groups share of O Germanys turnover, net losses and net liabilities for the period from 2 1 January 2000 to 19 February 2001, together with consolidated financial results for the period from 20 February 2001 to 31 March 2001.
Basis of preparation Merger accounting mmO plc was incorporated on 30 March 2001.
On 19 November 2001, its ordinary shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange and 2 the New York Stock Exchange.
This was the culmination of a group reorganisation undertaken by British Telecommunications plc BT to demerge its wireless business.
The financial statements have been prepared as if the mmO Group had been demerged from BT prior to 1 April 2000.
This presents 2 information which more accurately reects the ongoing operations of the Group.
Accordingly the demerger and related transactions have been accounted for using merger accounting principles as applicable to group reorganisations.
The financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies which differ in certain respects to those used in the preparation of the financial information contained within the Listing Particulars of mmO plc dated 18 September 2001 the Listing Particulars.
In the Listing 2 Particulars, a portion of BTs shortand long-term loans and other borrowings were allocated to the mmO Group.
The basis of preparation 2 adopted for these financial statements shows the results and financial position of the Group with no allocations of loans and other borrowings from BT.
Loans and other borrowings previously allocated to the Group for the purpose of the Listing Particulars of 16,140 million and the related interest payable, net of taxation, of 476 million, have not been allocated to the Group for the purpose of these financial statements.
This is consistent with the debt structure of the Group following the completion of its demerger from BT and reects the fact that these notional loans and other borrowings were not passed down to the Group on demerger.
The actual interest charge for the Group contained in the financial statements reects the interest on the Groups actual borrowings in the year.
The financial statements include the results of mmO plc and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been 2 eliminated.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as revenue recognition, provision for bad and doubtful debtors, depreciation and amortisation, valuation of inventory, pensions and other benets, and asset impairment.
Turnover Group turnover, which excludes value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value of services provided and equipment sales.
Mobile telecommunications service turnover includes turnover earned for usage of the Groups wireless network for voice and data transmission by O customers, connection charges, subscription fees and interconnect revenues.
Post-pay customers are billed in arrears 2 based on usage and turnover is recognised when the service is rendered.
Turnover for pre-pay customers is recorded as deferred revenues prior to commencement of services and is recognised as the pre-pay services are rendered.
Inbound roaming revenues, earned from other mobile operators whose customers roam onto the O network, and outbound roaming revenues, earned from certain customers roaming 2 outside their domestic coverage area, are recognised based upon usage and are included in mobile service turnover.
Turnover from subscription fees is recognised evenly throughout the periods to which they relate.
Revenues from connection charges are deferred and recognised over the estimated customer relationship period and are included in other turnover.
Hardware turnover principally consists of revenues from the sale of wireless mobile devices.
The revenue and related expenses associated with the sale of wireless handsets and accessories are recognised when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer.

Accounting policies continued Subscriber acquisition costs Subscriber acquisition costs, which include the commission costs associated with acquiring new subscribers and other incremental costs of customer acquisition, are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Advertising Advertising costs are included in administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions, adjusted for the effects of any hedging arrangements except for material exceptional items which are translated at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange and the differences arising from the translation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries at the closing rate are taken direct to reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The profit and loss and cash ows for the year of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings and interests in associates and joint ventures, represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
For all acquisitions arising on or after 1 April 1998, the goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis from the time of acquisition over a period estimated by the Directors to be its useful economic life.
The economic life is normally between 10 and 20 years, subject to review if and when an event or change occurs which may affect the asset life.
Where applicable, goodwill relating to overseas businesses is held as a foreign currency denominated asset.
For acquisitions made before the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, on 1 April 1998, the goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
The goodwill written off directly to reserves will be charged to the profit and loss account on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
Other intangible xed assets Licence fees paid to governments, which permit telecommunication activities to be operated for dened periods, are capitalised at cost and are amortised from the later of the start of the licence period or launch of service, to the end of the licence period on a straight-line basis.
Other licences are amortised over the period of the licence on a straight-line basis.
Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
The cost of tangible xed assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Depreciation is provided on tangible xed assets from the date they are brought into use, in equal instalments over their estimated useful lives, taking into account any residual values.
The lives assigned to tangible xed assets are: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold land and buildings Unexpired portion of lease or 40 years, whichever is the shorter Network assets 5 to 15 years Plant and machinery 2 to 5 years Computers, software and ofce equipment 2 to 6 years Motor vehicles 5 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in course of construction.
Accounting policies continued Fixed asset investments Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
The profit and loss account includes the Groups share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.
Other investments held as xed assets comprise equity shareholdings and other interests and are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Own shares The Group partially hedges its future obligations under certain share awards by holding its own shares in the mmO Employee Share Trust.
2 The cost of shares expected to be awarded under each plan is amortised evenly over the period from the original date of grant of the particular award to the time of vesting.
Own shares are held at cost less amortisation charged to date.
Fixed asset impairment Goodwill, other intangible assets and tangible assets are reviewed for impairment: i at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition: and ii in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Such events may include continuing operating losses, technological obsolescence or significant adverse changes in the business or the market in which the xed asset is used.
The impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset, or group of assets, with their recoverable amount.
For assets used in the continuing operations of the Group the recoverable amount is the assets value in use which is estimated by calculating the present value of its future cash ows.
For assets to be disposed, the recoverable amount is the assets net realisable value.
Impairment charges are recognised in the profit and loss account to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount in the period in which the impairment is identied.
Stocks Stocks comprise mainly handsets and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value which reects the value to the business of the handset in the hands of the subscriber on a first-in, first-out basis, after provisions for obsolescence.
Debtors Debtors are stated at estimated net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the invoiced amount less provisions for bad and doubtful debtors.
Provisions are made specically against debtors where there is evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay.
An additional provision is made based on an analysis of balances by age, previous losses experienced and general economic conditions.
Provisions Provisions are recognised by the Group when three criteria are met: i the Group has a constructive or legal obligation as a result of a past event: ii if it is probable that a transfer of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and iii a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
A provision is made for the present value of the cost of restoration of mast sites at the date of acquisition of the site in accordance with FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Post retirement benets The Group participates in or operates a number of pension schemes as disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements.
All pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The Group continues to apply the transitional disclosure requirements set out in FRS 17 Retirement benets which are provided in note 8.
The Group participates in a number of multi-employer pension schemes providing benets based on final pensionable salary, where the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the participating employers.
In its capacity as a participating employer, the Group is required to pay to the pension schemes a predetermined percentage of the pensionable payroll costs of those employees who are members of the scheme.
These costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
The Group is also the principal employer for certain pension schemes.
For these funded and unfunded dened benefit schemes, the expected costs of providing pensions and other post retirement benets, as calculated periodically by professionally qualied actuaries, are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees in the schemes in such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll.
For the funded schemes, the assets of the schemes are www.
qxd 4 6 03 1:56 pm Page 68 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued held separately from those of the principal employer.
For the unfunded schemes, no contributions are made by either employees or the employer to a separate pension fund but a provision is recorded on the balance sheet to recognise the accrued liability of the Group to date.
The Group also supports a number of dened contribution pension schemes where the benets are based on the level of contributions paid.
Costs arising from these schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Financial instruments Debt instruments Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds received.
Financing costs are amortised over the term of the debt to ensure a constant rate of charge.
Criteria to qualify for hedge accounting The Group considers its derivative financial instruments to be hedges when certain criteria are met.
For foreign currency derivatives, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and whose characteristics have been identied.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
For interest rate derivatives, the instrument must be related to assets or liabilities or a probable commitment, such as a future bond issue, and must also change the interest rate or the nature of the interest rate by converting a xed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments Interest differentials, under interest rate swap agreements used to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed, are recognised by adjustment of interest payable.
The forward exchange contracts used to change the currency mix of net debt are revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains and losses being shown as part of debtors or creditors.
The difference between spot and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of net interest payable over the term of the contract.
The forward exchange contracts hedging transaction exposures are revalued at the prevailing forward rate on the balance sheet date with net unrealised gains and losses being shown as debtors and creditors.
Leases and hire purchase contracts Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the periods of the leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Segmental analysis The Groups operations have been divided internally into three classes of business, in line with day-to-day managerial and budgetary control: 1 the supply of mobile telecommunications services and products: 2 the provision of mobile internet services: and 3 other businesses, which comprises Airwave, a terrestrial trunked radio business, and Manx Telecom, the xed and mobile telecommunications business in the Isle of Man.
Mobile telecommunications services mainly derives its turnover from the calls made and received by its customers using mobile telephones, from subscription fees charged to its contract customers and from handset equipment sales.
Mobile internet services generate revenues through advertising, provision of content and application and from e-commerce and m-commerce activities.

Pension costs 2003 2002 2001 m m m mmO Pension Plan cost 12 2 Contributions to the BT Pension Scheme 4 20 20 Other dened benefit schemes 4 42 Dened contribution schemes 4 21 24 26 23 The Group operates a number of pension schemes in its businesses.
All the Groups pension schemes are provided through either dened benefit or dened contribution arrangements.
Dened benefit schemes generally provide pensions based on the employees length of service and their final pensionable salary.
Dened contribution schemes offer employees individual funds which are converted into pension benets on retirement.
The majority of the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups nances.
The mmO Pension Plan 2 This plan is divided into dened benefit and dened contribution sections, as discussed below.
Dened benefit section In the UK, until 30 June 2002, the Group was a participating employer in the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, a funded dened benefit pension scheme which is the principal pension scheme of BT.
The BTPS is closed to new members.
Prior to the demerger from BT, certain employees of the Group were eligible to participate in this scheme.
While participating the Group paid to the BTPS a predetermined percentage of the pensionable payroll costs of those Group employees who were members of the scheme.
These costs have been charged in the period to which they relate.
A formal actuarial valuation of the BTPS was performed as at 31 December 1999.
Another formal actuarial valuation is due at 31 December 2002.
Details of the financial position of the BTPS and further information regarding the scheme are contained in the financial statements of BT Group plc.
On 1 July 2002 the mmO Pension Plan mmO PP, a new pension plan with dened benefit and dened contribution sections, was 2 2 established for employees in the United Kingdom by the Group in accordance with the Separation Agreement relating to the demerger of the Group from BT.
The dened contribution section is covered below.
Any active member of the BTPS employed by the Group could join a dened benefit section of, and elect to transfer their past service liability from the BTPS to, the new plan.
The vast majority of those eligible to transfer elected to do so.
The benets of all deferred and pensioner members at 30 June 2002 remain in the BTPS.
A share of the assets of the BTPS, determined on the basis of the past service liabilities of the members electing to transfer their benets to the new plan, were transferred to the mmO PP on 17 March 2003.
2 From 1 July 2002, the Group has been the principal employer of the mmO PP.
The pension costs have been assessed in accordance with the 2 advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The dened benets sections of the mmO PP are closed to new entrants and 2 therefore the current service cost is likely to increase as the members approach retirement.
The principal assumptions used to determine the pension cost for the period from 1 July 2002 are: mmO PP 2 % Nominal rate of increase in salaries 4.25% p. a. Nominal rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.50% p. a.
Investment return pre retirement 6.50% p. a.
Investment return post retirement 6.00% p. a. Ination assumption 2.50% p. a.
The first full actuarial valuation of the mmO PP will have an effective date of 30 June 2003.
An initial report has been completed 2 recommending an interim contribution rate and having an effective date of 1 July 2002.
The employer contribution rate has been set at 11.6 per cent of pensionable salaries.
This rate will be reviewed as part of the first full valuation.
On the inception of the mmO PP at 1 July 2002 2 no assets or benets had accrued to members in the new scheme.
Following the conrmation of the members electing to transfer their liabilities from the BTPS, a funding level of 99 per cent as at 1 July 2002 was assessed.
The transfer of assets to the mmO PP to cover the 2 liabilities of the members electing to transfer was completed on 17 March 2003 and the actual funding level has declined from 99 per cent owing to the fall in the UK equity market over that period.
The difference between the assets and liabilities has been amortised over the expected future working life of the active membership using the straight line method and included in the cost.
Pension costs continued Other dened benefit pension schemes The Group also operates funded dened benefit pension schemes in the Netherlands and in the Isle of Man.
The combined cost under SSAP 24 charged in the year for these schemes was 3 million 2002: 2 million.
At 31 March 2003, the Netherlands scheme had 693 active members 2002: 851 active members, and the Isle of Man scheme had 409 members of whom 264 were active 2002: 403 members of whom 274 were active.
The Isle of Man scheme was closed to new entrants on 30 June 2002.
A dened contribution scheme is available for new employees.
The sale of O Netherlands to Greeneld Capital Partners was announced on 14 April 2003.
The assets and liabilities of the O Netherlands 2 2 pension scheme are included in the disposal.
The aggregate market value of the assets of these schemes as at 31 March 2003 was 21 million 2002: 25 million.
The Group operates an unfunded dened benefit pension scheme in the UK.
A provision, determined in accordance with SSAP 24, is recorded on the balance sheet to recognise the accrued liability to date for this scheme.
The provision recorded at 31 March 2003 for the unfunded scheme was 5 million 2002: 4 million.
The cost charged for the scheme for the year was 1 million 2002: 1 million.
At 31 March 2003, the scheme had 23 members, of whom 22 were active 2002: 24 members, all of whom were active.
In Germany the Group operates a number of dened benefit schemes.
Until May 2001 the O Germany main scheme was unfunded.
This 2 scheme has been changed to a funded arrangement with payments being made to provide for previously unfunded liabilities over the period to the active members retirements.
The vast majority of members of the O Germany main scheme are now accruing benets under the 2 dened contribution arrangement.
The other dened benefit schemes are unfunded.
A provision of 7 million 2002: 5 million is recorded on the balance sheet to recognise the liabilities of the dened benefit schemes.
At 31 March 2003 the German schemes had 3,742 members 2002: 4,294 members.
Dened contribution schemes The mmO PP has a dened contribution section.
Prior to 1 July 2002, the Group participated in the BT Retirement Plan BTRP, a dened 2 contribution scheme established by BT with effect from 1 April 2001 for employees and certain employees of its subsidiaries who were not eligible to join the BTPS.
Members of the BTRP could elect to transfer their funds under management into the new mmO Plan dened 2 contribution section on its inception.
These funds were transferred on 14 March 2003.
The cost for the year to 31 March 2003 was 1 million.
The Group also operates dened contribution schemes in Ireland and Germany.
The cost for the year to 31 March 2003 was 1 million in Ireland and 2 million in Germany.
The assets of the dened contribution arrangements are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
There were no contributions outstanding or pre-paid at the year end.
FRS 17 disclosures In accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement benets, certain information regarding the Groups pension arrangements are disclosed below.
No comparative information is presented at the end of last year in respect of the mmO PP as it was 2 established during the current year, although information is provided at 1 July 2002, the date of inception of the Plan.
The initial actuarial valuation of the mmO PP including the subsequent assessment of the assets and liabilities transferred from the BTPS has 2 been updated to 31 March 2003 by an independent qualied actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
In accordance with FRS 17, the dened benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method.
Plan assets are stated at their market value.

On this basis, the fair value of plan assets, as at 31 March 2002, would have been 299 million.
Under FRS 17 the new plan was not expected to have either a significant surplus or a deficit.
The actual liabilities of the mmO PP at 1 July 2002 were 259 million.
The reduction compared to the anticipated liabilities at 31 March 2 2002 has occurred as a result of a reduction in the number of employees eligible to transfer their benets to the mmO PP following the 2 restructuring programme in the UK announced by the Group in 2002.
The past service liabilities of the members not eligible to transfer remain in the BTPS.
The assets of the mmO PP at 1 July 2002 have also fallen compared with the indicative asset valuation disclosed at 2 31 March 2002.
This is a combined result of the reduction in the numbers of employees transferring their benets to the mmO PP and the 2 fall in UK equity markets between 31 March and 1 July 2002.

The tax assessed for the year varied from the amount computed by applying the corporation tax rate to loss on ordinary activities before taxation.
The differences were attributable to the following factors: 2003 2002 2001 m m m UK corporation tax on loss at standard rate 3,061 262 1,038 Non-deductible depreciation, amortisation and impairment 2,387 124 929 Non-deductible non-UK losses 23 44 178 UK and non-UK tax rate differences 7 3 1 Capital allowances for period in excess deficit of depreciation 14 21 57 Losses carried forward 657 33 17 Pre-demerger losses 74 Other timing differences and adjustments 3 1 Current tax charge credit for year 10 11 29 Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group expects to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years.
The future tax charges will also continue to be affected by the fact that relief is not available for goodwill amortisation and by the inability to offset non-UK tax losses against taxable profits in the UK and other jurisdictions.
The deferred taxation credit charge was mainly the result of the tax effect of timing differences as follows: 2003 2002 2001 m m m Excess capital allowances 4 44 61 Other timing differences 76 50 12 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 7 6 8 Total deferred tax credit charge 65 12 41 11.
Loss per share Basic and diluted loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the financial year of 10,148 million 2002: 850 million, 2001: 3,533 million by 8,670 million shares 2002: 8,670 million, 2001: 8,670 million, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For 2002 the number of ordinary shares is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue for the period from demerger to 31 March 2002.
For 2001 the number of ordinary shares is based on the issued share capital of BT at the date of demerger and a one-for-one allotment at this date.
Impairment review In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill the Group regularly monitors the carrying values of its xed assets.
During the second half of the year ended 31 March 2003 certain events, including the Groups strategic review of the Dutch market which led to the announcement of the disposal of O Netherlands, indicated the Group should perform impairment reviews of its four principal 2 operations: its mobile telecommunications operations in the UK, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands.
In April 2003, the Group announced the sale of O Netherlands resulting in an accounting loss of approximately 1.4 billion, which provided 2 an indication that the valuation of mobile businesses may be lower than previously estimated.
Additionally, following the Competition Commissions report on mobile termination charges, the Group announced that it was reviewing the launch dates of its 3G services and would adopt a more prudent timetable where local regulatory requirements permitted.
The revision in this timetable, together with the current absence of evidence as to the present mass market appeal of 3G services and the limited availability of 2G 3G compatible handsets, has led management to review and revise the business plans of its mobile operations across its European footprint.
As a result of the above events, the carrying value of the xed assets of each of the Groups principal income generating units IGUs, being O UK, O Germany, O Ireland and O Netherlands, were compared to their respective recoverable amounts.
2 2 2 2 The announced disposal of O Netherlands has led to the carrying value of the net assets of the Dutch IGU being written down to their 2 recoverable amount, which in this case is the sale proceeds less direct costs of disposal.
This has resulted in an exceptional impairment charge of 1,364 million being recognised in the profit and loss account below Group operating loss.
With respect to the IGUs that are held for continuing use within the Group being O UK, O Germany and O Ireland, the carrying values of 2 2 2 their xed assets were compared to their value in use to the Group.
The value in use of each IGU is calculated with reference to the net present value of its future cash ows derived from the assets, using cash ow projections for the period up to 31 March 2013.
These projections cover a ten-year period, as management believes that throughout this ten-year period, the annual growth rate of the IGUs being assessed will differ from the average growth rates for the countries concerned.
For the periods beyond 1 April 2013, the projections use a long-term growth rate assumed to be at or below the nominal GDP growth rate of the country concerned.
The discount rates applied to the projections were based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital for the Group.
The effective pre-tax discount rate for each of our territories ranged between 10.4 per cent and 12.5 per cent.
The impairment review performed during the year ended 31 March 2003 revealed that the xed assets of each of the IGUs held for continuing use within the Group were impaired, resulting in an exceptional impairment charge of 8,300 million included within operating expenses.
The total exceptional impairment charges are analysed below: Licences, other intangible assets and Tangible Goodwill investments assets Total m m m m Operating exceptional items: O UK 198 2,102 2,300 2 O Germany 903 3,797 4,700 2 O Ireland 1,300 1,300 2 2,401 5,899 8,300 Non-operating exceptional items: O Netherlands 649 423 292 1,364 2 3,050 6,322 292 9,664 The carrying value of the Groups goodwill and licences after the impairment charges are 3,418 million and 4,164 million respectively.
The impairment charge relating to goodwill includes 47 million in respect of goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 which has been written off directly to reserves.
This goodwill has been reinstated and written off through the profit and loss account.
In calculating the value in use there is considerable uncertainty as to the present value of the future cash ows.
In assessing the future cash ows, assumptions have been made using the best estimates available at the time of performing the impairment review.
These estimates include those used to reect the growth rates up to 2013, the long-term growth rates beyond 2013, the discount rate, the competitive landscape, the take up and charge rate of data services and the availability of functioning technological infrastructure to support the 3G roll-out.
The actual outcome is uncertain and these estimates may change over time as subsequent changes in the mobile telecommunications industry, including advances in technology, changes in the performance of our businesses as a result of competitive pressure or otherwise, or potential difficulty in the implementation of the UMTS network, may in the future shorten the estimated useful lives or result in a further write down of these assets.
Similar impairment reviews were performed during the years ended 31 March 2002 and 2001.
The review in 2001 resulted in an exceptional charge to operating costs of 2,800 million in respect of O Germany, which was allocated to goodwill.

Financial instruments and risk management Financial risks are identied and managed by a centralised Group treasury function.
The Groups treasury policy, including details of the nature, terms and credit risk associated with financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk are described in the Treasury Management and Policies section of the operating and financial review and prospects on page 40.
Short-term debtors and creditors, where permitted by FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, have been excluded from the following disclosures, which are after taking account of interest rate and currency swaps where applicable.
The Group holds or issues financial instruments mainly to finance its operations, for the temporary investment of short-term funds and to manage currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations.
Further details on the nancing of operations is contained in the Source of Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the operating and financial review and prospects.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The objective is to match the prole and characteristics of Group funding equity and debt to that of the assets funded and to mitigate foreign exchange risk under the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors in the Treasury Policy document.
Fair value of financial instruments The Group held the following financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 March 2003.
The book and fair values of the assets are presented below.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
