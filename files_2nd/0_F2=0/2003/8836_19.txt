This loss is partially offset by a gain of US$2.4m in respect of the excess of insurance recoveries over the book value of fixed assets destroyed by a fire at our Rolls Wood Group joint venture facility in 2002.
A net tax charge of US$0.7m has been made in respect of these items.
ii Loss on termination of discontinued operations In 2001, a charge of US$13.6m was made in respect of closure costs of the Groups aero engine overhaul business based in Connecticut, which was closed in March 2002.
A further charge of US$2.7m has been made during 2003 in respect of the remaining fixed assets and stock and certain liabilities.
A tax credit of US$1.0m has been booked in respect of this provision.
iii Amounts written off investments During the year, ASCO plc ASCO has considered various options for refinancing its overall capital structure.
The refinancing initiatives are continuing, however it is believed that the overall debt is at such a level as to make the prospects remote of the Group receiving any proceeds from its investment in ASCO.
The Group effectively no longer exercises significant influence and accordingly has ceased to account for it as an associate with effect from 15 December 2003.
As a result the Group has transferred the investment to Other Investmentsand written it off in full resulting in a charge of US$13.8m.
The Group has no further financial obligation in relation to ASCO.
A tax credit of US$1.0m has been booked in relation to the amounts written off.

Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups current policy is to maintain approximately 50% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At the year-end, approximately 51% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk As regards liquidity, the Groups policy has throughout the year been that, to ensure continuity of funding, at least 90% of its borrowings should mature in more than a year.
At the year-end, 94% per cent of the Groups borrowings were due to mature in more than three years.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies, primarily US dollars and pounds sterling.
The Group also has significant overseas subsidiaries which operate in North America and South America and whose revenues and expenses are denominated predominantly in US dollars.
In order to protect the Groups US dollar balance sheet from the movements in the exchange rates, the Group finances its net investment in most overseas subsidiaries primarily by means of borrowings denominated in their functional currency.
The Group has not hedged its investment in companies with a sterling functional currency as these investments were made when the Group reported in sterling.
The Group is therefore exposed to exchange movements in reserves on the retranslation of these companies at closing rate.
John Wood Group PLC 67 John Wood Group PLC Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2003 17.
Financial instruments continued Some of the sales of the Groups businesses are to customers in foreign locations.
These sales are priced in local currency but invoiced in the currencies of the customers involved.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on sales at the time of sale through forward currency contracts.
The existing exchange controls in Venezuela will result in increased foreign currency exposure whilst they are in place although there has been no material impact to date.
Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2003, after taking account of the interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest and currency profile, was as follows: Floating Total rate Fixed rate financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities US$m US$m US$m US Dollars 166.6 41.6 125.0 Canadian Dollars 31.3 31.3 - Australian Dollars 11.3 11.3 - GBP Sterling 16.1 16.1 - Euros 15.6 15.6 - Colombian Pesos 10.5 10.5 - Other currencies 0.9 0.9 - At 31 December 2003 252.3 127.3 125.0 US Dollars 215.8 90.8 125.0 Canadian Dollars 20.1 20.1 - Other currencies 10.0 10.0 - At 31 December 2002 245.9 120.9 125.0 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, for example tax balances.
The Group has entered into US$125m of interest rate swaps from floating to fixed rates as at 31 December 2003 2002 : US$125m.
The weighted average interest rate excluding margin currently 0.6% for fixed rate financial liabilities was 4.4% 2002 : 4.5%.
This rate is fixed for between 3 and 4 years 2002 : between 4 and 5 years.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods of between one month and three months.
68 John Wood Group PLC John Wood Group PLC Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2003 17.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk of financial assets The Group has no significant financial assets, other than short term deposits, cash at bank and short-term loans to joint ventures.
US$ short term deposits have earned interest at rates between 0.8% and 1.7% in 2003.
Floating rate sterling cash earns interest at between UK base rate and UK base rate less 10 basis points.
US$ cash and cash denominated in other currencies earns interest at varying market rates applicable to each currency.
Interest on loans to joint ventures is charged at floating market rates.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the groups financial liabilities other than short-term trade creditors and accruals at 31 December was as follows: 2003 2002 Deferred Deferred consideconsideration Debt Total ration Debt Total US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m In one year or less, or on demand 4.9 13.9 18.8 - 10.7 10.7 In more than one year but not more than two years 1.3 - 1.3 6.7 - 6.7 In more than two years but not more than five years 1.3 230.9 232.2 5.8 222.7 228.5 7.5 244.8 252.3 12.5 233.4 245.9 Borrowing facilities The group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2003 of US$331.1m 2002 : US$369.2m in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These are floating rate facilities which expire on 9 April 2007.

Financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 and 2003.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Set out below the table is a summary of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instrument.
2003 2002 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value US$m US$m US$m US$m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations: Short-term borrowings 13.9 13.9 10.7 10.7 Long-term borrowings 230.9 230.9 222.7 222.7 Deferred consideration 7.5 7.5 12.5 12.5 Loans to joint ventures 9.3 9.3 10.9 10.9 Loans to associate - - 3.3 3.3 Short-term deposits 22.5 22.5 24.8 24.8 Cash at bank and in hand 47.3 47.3 31.4 31.4 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps - 6.6 - 6.1 Forward foreign currency contracts 1.0 1.0 1.3 1.3 Under the Groups accounting policy, forward contracts that are entered into in order to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities are revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains losses being shown as part of the underlying asset or liability being hedged.
Changes in the value of the swap as a result of changes in interest rates are not included in the book value of the relevant asset or liability.
These contracts were entered to hedge sterling assets in dollar functional companies.
Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps, currency swaps and Fair value is based on market price of comparable instruments at the forward foreign currency contracts balance sheet date.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been valued at spot rate on the balance sheet date as the contracts mature within one year.
Short-term deposits, short and long-term The fair value of short-term deposits, short and long-term loans and borrowings, deferred consideration and overdrafts, deferred consideration and loans to joint ventures and loans to joint ventures and associates associates approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments.
The long term loans are generally rolled over for periods of three months or less.
70 John Wood Group PLC John Wood Group PLC Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2003 17.
Financial instruments continued Currency exposures To mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas the Group either borrows in the local currencies of its main operating units or swaps other borrowings, using currency swaps, into such local currencies.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The Group has typically not hedged its net investments in sterling functional companies.
