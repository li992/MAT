They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
a Revenue, expenses and interest payable - Income from equity investments, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Foreign income is converted at the exchange rate applicable at the time of receipt.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities, short term deposits, expenses and interest payable are treated on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to capital where they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments.
In this respect the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital, in line with the boards expectation of returns from the companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively.
b Investments - Listed investments are valued at middle market prices.
Unlisted investments are valued at market prices ruling where an organised market in such investments exists: other unquoted investments are included at directors valuation.
Where a price is not readily available the holding is valued at cost unless circumstances indicate a different valuation is warranted.
In general, valuations are increased where a substantial arms length transaction has occurred subsequent to acquisition, at a price higher than cost.
Valuations are decreased where subsequent transactions have taken place at a price lower than cost, where Fidelitys Fair Value Committee is aware that the company is experiencing operating difficulties, or there is a limited market place for the shares thus making them illiquid.
c Transactions denominated in foreign currencies - Any such transactions are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves realised and unrealised.
d Realised capital reserves - Gains and losses on realisation of investments and differences on exchange are dealt with in the realised capital reserves.
The capital element of the investment management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is credited to this reserve.
e Unrealised capital reserves - Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held are dealt with in the unrealised capital reserve.
f Taxation - Deferred taxation is provided for in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that its recovery is considered more likely than not.
Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS 19 Deferred Tax.

Prior to 1 August 2002 the management fee was paid to Edinburgh Fund Managers plc at 0.30% per annum of the total assets of the company, after deducting current liabilities and excluding commonly managed funds 2003 1,510,000.
Included in the management fee is an amount of 393,000 paid to Edinburgh Fund Managers plc for the early termination of their management agreement.
The fee is subject to VAT at the appropriate rate.
The investment management fee is chargeable 30% to revenue and 70% to capital.

The differences are explained below: 2003 2002 000 000 Return on ordinary activities before tax 27,065 31,144 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2002 30% 8,119 9,343 Effects of: Income not subject to corporation tax 9,790 10,846 Increase in excess management expenses excess loan relationship debits in the revenue account 1,671 1,503 Overseas tax expensed - 1 Current tax charge note 7a - 1 Investment trust companies are exempt from tax on capital gains if they meet the Inland Revenue criteria set out in s842 ICTA 1988 for a given period.
Therefore, any capital return is not included in the above reconciliation.
c At 31 March 2003, the company had net surplus management expenses and net surplus losses on loan relationships being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable totalling 131,149,793 2002 109,190,095.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these.
This is because the company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and accordingly, it is unlikely that the company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.

The increase in the turnover rate was partly due to the realignment of the portfolio following the change of investment manager.
Page 34 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts 11 FRS 13 - Financial Instruments The investment objective of the company is detailed on page 1.
In pursuit of this objective, the company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Debenture stocks The risks arising from the companys financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk, equity price changes and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the companys business.
It represents the potential loss the company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
At each board meeting the board considers the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The investment manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values, with the exception of the long term fixed rate debenture stocks, whose fair value as at 31 March 2003 has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the stocks and is set out below.
2003 2002 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 1 11 % debenture stock 2014 147,041 100,000 142,813 100,000 2 3 7 % debenture stock 2022 119,047 100,000 114,625 100,000 4 266,088 200,000 257,438 200,000 Interest rate risk All of the companys long term debt is fixed rate which exposes the company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is provided in note 14.
The companys financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The company also has substantial cash balances of 14,808,000.
The rate of interest on the cash balances is currently 3.0625%, consequently the risk of a decrease in cash interest earned is low.
Page 35 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts The interest profile of the companys financial liabilities excluding short-term creditors, as at 31 March 2003 and 2002 was as follows: Currency 2003 2002 fixed rate fixed rate financial liabilities financial liabilities 000 000 UK Sterling 200,000 200,000 2003 2003 weighted average fixed rate financial liabilities: interest weighted average period rate for which rate is fixed UK Sterling 9.625% 184.5 months Foreign currency risk The company has a small holding denominated in a currency other than the companys base currency sterling.
The one remaining US Dollar stock is due to a previous strategy where overseas unquoted stocks were held.
Liquidity risk The companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities, which can be easily sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the companys borrowing commitments are explained in note 14 to the accounts.
The maturity profile of the companys financial liabilities at 31 March 2003 and 2002 is as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 In more than five years 200,000 200,000 200,000 200,000 Short-term debtors and short-term creditors are excluded from the above analysis.
The company is invested in the Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc - Sterling Fund.
The advantages of investing in the Fund is that the rate of interest generated is consistent, as well as providing instant access to the invested cash.
The Fund endeavours to maintain a Triple A rating Aaa and an MR1 rating by Moodys.
The Fund will be invested in low risk short term investments and accordingly will carry a low degree of risk.
The Fund will invest in instruments whose maturity or interest rate refixing date is less than one year.
It is expected that the average maturity will generally be under sixty days.
The Fund may invest in bankers acceptances, certificates of deposit fixed and variable, promissory notes master notes, commercial paper fixed and variable, floating rate notes, medium term notes, securites issued by the government primarily of an EU member state or any other OECD government including supra-national entities and securities or discount notes issued by agencies backed by such governments or supra-national entities, securities issued by non-government institutions.
Fidelity receives a management fee capped at 0.15% of the Net Asset Value of the Fund.
The manager has the option to invest up to 200m of the above debenture stocks in the equity market.
However using 100% of the debenture stocks at a time when the portfolio has fallen in value would leave the company potentially overgeared to the market.
In a rising market the company would benefit, but in a falling market the impact would be severe.
In order to manage the level of gearing, Fidelity invests part of the assets available in short term cash deposits.
This controls the level of net gearing.
Page 36 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts Counterparty risk Certain transactions in securities that the company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver either the shares on a purchase or the cash on a sale after the company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
The company buys and sells investments on a delivery versus payment basis to manage risk.
The company only buys and sells investments through brokers which have been approved by the manager as an acceptable counterparty.
Additionally, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any broker at any time, and these limits are reviewed on a regular basis.

The 7 % debenture stock is redeemable at par on 30 September 2022 and interest is 4 payable in half yearly instalments in March and September each year.
Both debenture stocks are secured by a floating charge over the whole of the assets of the company.
The effect on the net asset value of deducting the debenture stocks at market value rather than at par is disclosed in note 17.

"17 Net asset value per share Total shareholders funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 4 ""Capital Instruments""."
The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the articles of association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the net asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.
A reconciliation between the two sets of figures is given below: 2003 2002 Total shareholders funds 681,318,000 1,201,578,000 Adjusted net assets 676,419,000 1,196,428,000 Number of equity shares in issue at year end 242,796,714 246,821,714 Total shareholders funds per share 280.61p 486.82p Less: Unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 2.02p 2.09p Adjusted net asset value per share 278.59p 484.73p Page 38 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Notes to the Accounts Net asset value per share - continued 2003 2002 000 000 The movements during the year of the assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows: Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2002 1,196,428 1,367,882 Total recognised capital loss for the year 503,374 143,493 Revenue return for the year 27,065 31,143 Dividend appropriated in the year 32,016 31,230 Movement in unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 251 251 Share buybacks 11,935 28,125 Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2003 676,419 1,196,428 The net asset value adjusted to include the debenture stocks at market value rather than at par is 251.38p 2002 461.46p.
