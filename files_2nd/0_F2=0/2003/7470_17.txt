23 Adjustments to prior year balance sheets Adjustments relating to the following matters have been made to the balance sheets as at 30 September 2001 and 2002: 1 Loans amounting to 27.5 million, which had been repaid close to the year end, were incorrectly included in long term loans and cash in hand in the Group and Company balance sheets at 30 September 2002: and 2 Goodwill previously written off to reserves did not take account of certain amounts due, which were waived at the time of acquisition.
