The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which are in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Contingent consideration, to be satisfied in shares, for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is dependent upon future profits of those subsidiaries and at the discretion of MITIE.
It is not possible to quantify accurately, in advance, the final amounts which may become payable.
In connection with the sale of The Platform Company UK Ltd formerly MITIE Powered Access Ltd, the Group has guaranteed lease commitments amounting to 2,723,000.
These commitments reduce to 1,049,000 and nil at the end of the next two years respectively.
Against these guarantees, the Group has received indemnities from the Groups bankers of 464,000 and from the suppliers of the leased equipment of 602,000, giving a net contingent liability of 1,656,000.

26 Pensions In November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board ASB issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
In November 2002, an amendment to FRS 17 was published which allowed an extension to the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
The probability of implementation is uncertain and partly dependent upon proposals from the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Group will take advice to ensure that it continues to adopt the best practice in respect of accounting for retirement benefits.
The Group is in the second year of the transitional arrangements under FRS 17 and the required disclosures to the extent not given in a are set out in b. a SSAP 24 The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme and the MITIE Group PLC Passport Pension Scheme.
The assets of both Schemes are held separately from the Group, being invested in UK equities and with insurance companies.
Contributions to the Schemes are charged to the Profit and Loss Account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme The most recent valuation was at 6 April 2002.
It was assumed that: Investment return pre retirement 7.00% Investment return post retirement 5.50% Salary increases 4.50% Present and future pension increases 3.00% The next actuarial valuation is due on 6 April 2005.
The 2002 actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the assets was 24,401,000 and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 87% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The contributions of the Group and employees are 10% 2002: 10% and 7.5% 2002: 7.5% of pensionable earnings respectively.
42 MITIE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2003 26 Pensions continued MITIE Group PLC Passport Pension Scheme The most recent valuation was at 6 April 2002.
The 2002 actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the assets was 581,000 and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 67% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The contributions of the Group and employees total 32% 2002: 23.5% with employees contributing between 1.5% and 6%.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benefits As stated above, the Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes.
The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosure have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 6 April 2002, updated to 31 March 2003 by a qualified actuary.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the Accounts in respect of the Group pension schemes are based on actuarial valuations carried out at 6 April 2002.
This does not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock market values since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next SSAP 24 triennial valuation as at 6 April 2005 based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until the adoption of FRS 17.
The figures currently used for accounting purposes as regards pension costs are likely to change significantly as and when FRS 17 is adopted.
The costs of death in service benefit for members of the Schemes are fully insured by the Schemes.
The projected unit valuation method has been used.
