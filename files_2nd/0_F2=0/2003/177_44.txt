30 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS In January 2004, Acambis announced the outcome of a project prioritisation review.
As a result, an operational review was also completed and Acambis decided to consolidate its research activities at its facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The research operation in Cambridge, UK will close during 2004.
However, Acambis is retaining clinical and regulatory functions in Cambridge, UK, as well as various head office functions and sales, marketing and business development.
Once the operational review is fully implemented during 2004, Acambis headcount is expected to reduce by around 40 to around 280 worldwide.
