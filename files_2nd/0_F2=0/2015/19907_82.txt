On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and net asset value per share.

This reflects the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group.

The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 are Operations and Property.
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.
The Groups properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom.
The Group therefore has one meaningful geographical segment.
2.2 Earnings The Operations segment manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
The way in which the Operations segment adds value to the business is set out in the Operations review on pages 37 39.
The Operations segment is the main contributor to EPRA earnings and EPRA EPS and these are therefore the key indicators which are used by the Board to manage the Operations business.
The Board does not manage or monitor the Operations segment through the balance sheet and therefore no segmental information for assets and liabilities is provided for the Operations segment.
