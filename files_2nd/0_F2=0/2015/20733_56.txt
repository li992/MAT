Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2015 | 77 23 Financial instruments and Risk The Strategic Report details the Companys approach to investment risk management on pages 18 and 19 and the accounting policies on pages 57 to 62 explain the basis on which currencies and investments are valued for accounting purposes.
The Directors are of the opinion that the fair values of financial assets and liabilities of the Group are not materially different to their carrying values.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group and the Company will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the use of debt and equity balances.
The Group's and Companys overall strategy remains unchanged from the year ended 31 December 2014.
The capital structure of the Group and the Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 15, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.
The Board reviews the capital structure of the Company and the Group on an at least semi-annual basis.
The Group and the Company have decided that net gearing should at no time exceed 30% of the net assets of either the Group or the Company.
Group Company 000 Dec 15 Dec 14 Dec 15 Dec 14 Debt 390,000 380,000 390,000 380,000 Cash and cash equivalents 25,153 44,102 16,967 40,685 Net debt 364,847 335,898 373,033 339,315 Net debt as % of net assets 12.4 % 11.1 % 12.7 % 11.2 % Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities, private equity, financial instruments and its subsidiary businesses for the long term in order to achieve the investment objectives set out on page 5.
In pursuing these objectives the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for payment as dividends.
The principal financial instruments at risk comprise those in the Companys investment portfolio and this note addresses these risks below.
The Group has certain additional risks, and these are detailed in the appropriate sections below.
These risks and the Directors approach to managing them are set out below under the following headings: market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and gearing risk.
The Group has a risk management framework in place which is described in detail on pages 18 to 19.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks have not changed from the previous accounting year.
23.1 Market Risk Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk see note 23.2, interest rate risk see note 23.3 and other price risk see note 23.4.
Market risk is managed on a regular basis by the Asset Allocation Committee.
The purpose of this executive committee is to manage the capital of the Company within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Companys strategy on investment risk is outlined in our statement of investment objectives and policy on page 5.
Details of the investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed on pages 12 to 13.
23.2 Currency Risk Some of the Groups assets, liabilities and transactions are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency of Sterling.
Consequently the Group is exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
The Groups currency holdings and gains losses thereon are reviewed regularly by the Directors, and the currency risk is managed on a regular basis by the Asset Allocation Committee within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency exposure.
The currency exposure for overseas investments is based on the quotation currency of each holding, while the currency exposure for net monetary assets is based on the currency in which each asset or liability is denominated.
At the reporting date the Group and Company had the following exposures: 78 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2015 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.2 Currency Risk Group and Company Currency Exposure Total Total Overseas Net monetary currency Overseas Net monetary currency investments assets exposure investments assets exposure 000 Dec 15 Dec 15 Dec 15 Dec 14 Dec 14 Dec 14 US dollar 1,481,269 740 1,482,009 1,328,147 5,560 1,333,707 Euro 396,450 - 396,450 418,567 2,110 420,677 Yen 178,833 - 178,833 53,519 - 53,519 Other non-sterling 437,114 - 437,114 377,814 205 378,019 2,178,047 7,875 2,185,922 2,493,666 740 2,494,406 Sensitivity analysis If Sterling had strengthened by 5% 5% relative to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, the income statement and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis is performed on the same basis as for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The revenue return impact is an estimated figure for 12 months based on the cash balances at the reporting date.

23.3 Interest Rate Risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in a number of ways.
A movement in interest rates may affect the fair value of investments in fixed interest rate securities, income receivable on cash deposits and interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which are approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows as a result of an interest rate change are taken into account when making investment or borrowing decisions.
The following table details the Groups and Companys exposure to interest rate risks for bank and loan balances: Group Company 000 Dec 15 Dec 14 Dec 15 Dec 14 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank 25,153 44,102 16,967 40,685 Bank loans repayable within one year 290,000 280,000 290,000 280,000 264,847 235,898 273,033 239,315 Sensitivity analysis If interest rates had decreased by 0.25% 0.25%, with all other variables held constant, the income statement result and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have increased by the amounts shown below.

As the majority of the Groups financial assets are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes in market conditions will directly affect gains and losses on investments and net assets.
The Directors manage price risk by having a suitable investment objective for the Company.
The Board reviews this objective and investment performance regularly.
The risk is managed on a regular basis by the Asset Allocation Committee within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks A listing of the Companys equity investment portfolio is shown on pages 12 to 13.
The largest amount of equity investments by value is in North America, with significant amounts also in Europe, Asia and the UK.
It also shows the concentration of investments in various sectors.
The following table details the Groups exposure to market price risk on its quoted and unquoted equity investments: Group Company 000 Dec 15 Dec 14 Dec 15 Dec 14 Investments at fair value through Profit & Loss Listed 2,930,872 2,670,642 2,930,872 2,670,642 Unlisted 47,778 59,873 47,778 59,873 Investments in Collective Investment Schemes 158,009 435,659 158,009 435,659 Investments in Related and Subsidiary Companies 170,738 172,658 173,012 172,736 Investment Property - 4,830 - 4,830 3,307,397 3,343,662 3,309,671 3,343,740 The Company held the investment property through a subsidiary Limited Partnership, ATREP LP.

80 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2015 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.5 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
This risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out with a number of well established, approved brokers.
Investment transactions are carried out on a cash against receipt or cash against delivery basis The Group minimises credit risk through banking polices which restrict banking deposits to highly rated financial institutions.
The policies also set maximum exposure to individual banks.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties that have been approved by the Asset Allocation Committee and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate cash and gilts as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
At the reporting date, the Groups and Company's cash and cash equivalents exposed to credit risk were as follows: Group Company 000 Dec 15 Dec 14 Dec 15 Dec 14 Credit Rating Aa1 15,248 - 15,248 - Aa2 - 40,426 - 40,426 A3 9,905 - 1,719 - Baa - 3,676 - 259 25,153 44,102 16,967 40,685 Average maturity 1 day 1 day 1 day 1 day The Companys UK listed equities and its overseas listed equities are held by Bank of New York Mellon as custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
23.6 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities.
This is not a significant risk for the Company as the majority of its assets are investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
It also has the ability to borrow, which gives it access to additional funding when required.

23.7 Gearing Risk This is the risk that the movement in the fair value of the assets of the Company is amplified by any gearing that the Company may have.
The exposure to this risk and the sensitivity analysis is detailed below.

23.8 Hierarchical Valuation of Financial Instruments The Group refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets develop.
While the Group believes its valuation techniques to be appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could result in different estimates of fair value at the balance sheet date.
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs The following table analyses the fair value measurements for the Group's and Company's assets and liabilities measured by the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is categorised at 31 December 2015.
All fair value measurements disclosed are recurring fair value measurements.
Fair Value Assets in Level 1 The quoted market price used for financial investments held by the Group is the current bid price.
These investments are included within Level 1 and comprise equities, bonds and exchange traded derivatives.
Fair Value Assets in Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and with minimal reliance on entity specific estimates.
Fair Value Assets in Level 3 Level 3, excluding the valuations of the subsidiaries, are reviewed at least annually by the Valuation Committee who are assigned responsibility by the Board of Alliance Trust PLC.
The valuations of the subsidiaries are approved annually by the Audit Committee and then recommended to the Valuation Committee.
The Valuation Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation models, inputs, using the various valuation methods in accordance with the Group's valuation policy.
The Committee will determine the appropriateness of any valuation of the underlying assets.
The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances for fair value measurement in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
000 Group Company Dec 15 Dec 14 Dec 15 Dec 14 Balance at 1 January 232,531 197,702 232,609 197,777 Net loss gain from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 16,556 32,821 14,360 32,824 Purchases at cost 42,908 18,849 42,908 18,849 Sales proceeds 38,175 16,992 38,175 16,992 Realised loss gain on sale 2,192 151 2,192 151 Balance at 31 December 218,516 232,531 220,790 232,609 Investments in subsidiary companies Level 3 are valued in the Group accounts at 170.7m 172.7m and in the Companys accounts at 173.0m 172.7m being the Directors' estimate of their fair value, using the guidelines and methodologies on valuation published by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association and where applicable external valuations.
This represents the Directors' view of the amount for which the subsidiaries could be exchanged between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction.
This does not assume that the underlying business is saleable at the reporting date or that the Company currently has any intention to sell the subsidiary business in the future.
The Directors have used several valuation methodologies as prescribed in the guidelines to arrive at their best estimate of fair value including discounted cash flow calculations, revenue and earnings multiples and recent market transactions where available.
Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2015 | 83 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.8 Hierarchical Valuation of Financial Instruments The following key assumptions are relevant to the fair valuation of our investment in our subsidiary companies, and are consistent with prior years: Alliance Trust Savings - This is valued as a trading business.
For the fair valuation of ATS at 31 December 2015 the Board has used an external valuation.
A discounted cash flow, revenue multiple and an earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation multiple approach have been used for comparative purposes.
Alliance Trust Investments - This is valued as a trading business.
A discounted cashflow, revenue multiple and an earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation multiple valuation approach has been adopted.
The multiples applied in valuing our subsidiaries are derived from comparable companies sourced from market data.
Mineral rights are carried at fair value and are valued in the Companys accounts at 17.5m 29.9m being the Directors' estimate of their fair value, using the guidelines and methodologies on valuation published by the Oklahoma Tax Commission and for non-producing properties, the Lierle US Price Report.
The table below details how an increase or decrease in the respective input variables would impact the valuation disclosed for the relevant Level 3 assets.

products condensate Average bonus 1 0.5 1,000 1,000 multiple non-producing The change in valuation disclosed in the above table shows the direction an increase or decrease in the respective input variables would have on the valuation result.
For Alliance Trust Savings, an increase in the assets under administration AUA growth multiple and EBITDA multiple or a decrease in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the estimated value.
For Alliance Trust Investments, an increase in the revenue and EBITDA multiple or a decrease in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the estimated value.
For Mineral rights, an increase in the revenue multiple and average bonus multiple would lead to an increase in the estimated value.
For the 31 December 2015 fair valuation of ATS the Board has used an independent and external valuation to verify the Directors fair valuation of the business.
This approach has been taken subsequent to the purchase of Stocktrade and the decision to adopt an external valuation is to apply a degree of independence and external challenge into the valuation.
Private equity investments, both fund-to-fund and direct included under Level 3, are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued in September 2009.
Unlisted investments in private equity are stated at the valuation as determined by the Valuation Committee based on information provided by the General Partner.
The General Partners policy in valuing unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value.
The General Partner will generally rely on the fund's investment managers fair value at the last reported period, rolled forward for any cashflows.
However if the General Partner does not feel the manager is reflecting a fair value they will select a valuation methodology that is most appropriate for the particular investments in that fund and generate a fair value.
In those circumstances the General Partner believes the most appropriate methodologies to use to value the underlying investments in the portfolio are: Price of a recent investment Multiples Net assets Industry valuation benchmarks An entity is not required to create quantitative information to comply with this disclosure requirement if quantitative unobservable inputs are not developed by the entity when measuring fair value for example, when an entity uses prices from prior transactions or third-party pricing information without adjustment.
Alliance Trust PLC receives information from the General Partner on the underlying investments which is subsequently reviewed by the Valuation Committee.
Where Alliance Trust PLC does not feel that the valuation is appropriate, an adjustment will be made.
