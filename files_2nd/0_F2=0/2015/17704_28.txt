b Financial liabilities Revolving credit facility The Group has a revolving credit facility in place for a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million, which was negotiated on 24 November 2010 with a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank.
The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to fund potential acquisitions.
All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary terms for such finance arrangements and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points.
During 2015, the term of the facility was successfully extended to 2018 at a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million whereby existing lenders opted to take up US$25 million from lenders who opted not to extend.
At 31 December 2015, none of the funds were drawn under the facility.
The shares of all significant subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the loan.
Financial risk management The Company has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations: a credit risk: and b liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Companys exposure to each of the above risks and the Companys objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Companys risk management framework.
The Companys risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Companys activities.
The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument.
For cash and cash equivalents and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 157 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 16.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk arises from loans to two subsidiaries, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties whom the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
Location of credit risk is determined by physical location of the bank branch, customer or counterparty.
The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months.
Investment counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moodys Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poors.
No more than 25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America, United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group.
Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash and cash equivalents in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements.
Company policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets in Note 15.
The Company does not hold collateral as security for any receivables.
The Company does not grade the credit quality of receivables.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Companys significant financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.
