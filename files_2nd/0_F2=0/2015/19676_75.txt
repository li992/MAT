The Groups credit ratings are also important in maintaining an efficient cost of capital and in determining collateral requirements throughout the Group.
As at 31 March 2015, the Groups long term credit rating was Astable outlook for Standard & Poors and A3 negative outlook for Moodys.
Further detail of the capital management objectives, policies and procedures are included in the Financial management and balance sheet section of the Financial Overview at pages 20 to 22 of this report.
The maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Groups capital structure, and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing.
Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Groups credit ratings.
The Group has the option to purchase its own shares from the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices and economic conditions.
The use of share buy-backs is the Groups benchmark for investment decisions and is utilised at times when management believe the Groups shares are undervalued.
No share buy-back was made during the year.
The Groups debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in Sterling and Euros as well as private placements and medium term bank loans, including those with the European Investment Bank.
In addition, the Group has issued hybrid capital securities which bring together features of both debt and equity and are perpetual and subordinate to all senior creditors.
The Group has 1.5bn of committed bank facilities which relate to the Groups revolving credit and bilateral facilities that can be accessed at short notice for use in managing the Groups short term funding requirements, however, these committed facilities remain undrawn for the majority of the time.
At 31 March 2015, the Group had a 50m facility with the European Investment Bank that is expected to be drawn in the first half of 2015 16 when it will become a term loan.
The Group capital comprises: 2014 Restated 2015 note 2 ii m m Total borrowings excluding finance leases 5,781.0 5,966.1 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 1,512.3 458.9 Net debt excluding hybrid capital 4,268.7 5,507.2 Hybrid capital 3,371.1 2,186.8 Cash held as collateral 71.7 51.2 Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital 7,568.1 7,642.8 Equity attributable to shareholders of the parent 2,709.4 2,932.7 Total capital 10,277.5 10,575.5 172 SSE plc Annual Report 2015 1.

C Cap api it ta al l an and d f fi inanc nanci ia al l r ri is sk k m mana anag ge em me en nt t c con ont tiinue nued d Under the terms of its major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenant: - Interest Cover Ratio: The company shall procure that the ratio of Operating Profit to Net Interest Payable for any relevant period is not less than 2.5 to 1.
The following definitions apply in the calculation of these financial covenants: - Operating Profit means, in relation to a relevant period, the profit on ordinary activities before taxation after adding back Net Interest Payable of the Group for that relevant period but after adjusting this amount to exclude any exceptional profits or losses and, for the avoidance of doubt, before taking account of any extraordinary profits or losses and excluding the effect of IAS 39.
- Net Interest Payable means, in respect of any relevant period, interest payable during that relevant period less interest receivable during that relevant period.
In summary, the Groups intent is to balance returns to shareholders between current returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth.
In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the current economic environment prudently.
There were no changes to the Groups capital management approach during the year.
Financial risk management This note presents information about the fair value of the Groups financial instruments, the Groups exposure to the risks associated with those instruments, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further qualitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: - Credit risk.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Risk and Trading Committee, which reports to the Executive Committee, comprises the two Executive Directors and senior managers from the Energy Portfolio Management, Retail, Corporate and Finance functions.
Its specific remit is to support the Groups risk management responsibilities by reviewing the strategic, market, credit, operational and liquidity risks and exposures that arise from the Groups energy portfolio management, generation and treasury operations.
This committee is discussed further in the Directors Report.
The Groups policies for risk management are established to identify the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
These policies, and the systems used to monitor activities, are reviewed regularly by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Exposure to the commodity, currency and interest rate risks noted arise in the normal course of the Groups business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks.
The objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year are explained below.
The Company is required to disclose information on its financial instruments and has adopted policies identical to that of the Group, where applicable.
Separate disclosure is provided, where necessary.
Before detailing the relevant qualitative and quantitative disclosures in relation to the potential risks faced by the Group, details on the different categories of financial instrument and the carrying and fair values of each of those categories is provided below.
Basis of determining fair value Certain assets and liabilities designated and carried at amortised cost are loans and receivables.
For certain current assets and liabilities their carrying value is equivalent to fair value due to short term maturity.
Assets and liabilities designated at fair value and the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities have been determined by reference to closing rate market values.
This basis has been used in valuing interest rate instruments, foreign currency hedge contracts and foreign currency denominated long-term fixed rate debt.
Commodity contracts fair values are based on published price quotations.
The fair values are stated at a specific date and may be different from the amounts which will actually be paid or received on settlement of the instruments.
The fair value of items such as property, plant and equipment, internally generated brands or the Groups customer base are not included as these are not financial instruments.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk arising from the Groups normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with Group policies and procedures.
Generally, for significant contracts, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided.
Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.

The Groups greatest credit risks lie with the operations of the Energy Supply business, the Wholesale procurement activities conducted by Energy Portfolio Management activities and the activities carried out by the Groups Treasury function.
In all cases, specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities are applied.
Exposure to credit risk in the retail supply of electricity and gas to end user customers arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables.
The financial strength and creditworthiness of business customers is assessed prior to commencing, and for the duration of, their contract of supply.
Domestic customers creditworthiness is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information.
Exposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty: - holds an investment grade credit rating: or - can be assessed as adequately creditworthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies: or - can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance withgroup procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions: or - can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the Risk and Trading Committee within its authorised limits as delegated by the GroupBoard.
Credit support clauses or side agreements are typically included or entered into to protect the Group against counterparty failure or non-delivery.
Within the Energy Portfolio Management activities, significant volumes of commodity derivative products are traded through cleared exchanges to mitigate credit risk.
Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are monitored by category of credit risk and are subject to approved limits.
At 31 March 2015, the Groups Energy Portfolio Management activities had pledged 235.8m 2014 249.1m of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received 41.8m 2014 41.0m of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on credit risk.
Bank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and adjusted for future volatility and probability of default.
Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to cash.
These are subject to insignificant risk of change in value or credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments are entered into to cover the Groups market risks commodity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and are consequently covered elsewhere in this note.
Trade receivables represent the most significant exposure to credit risk and are stated after an allowance for impairment.
Concentrations of risk Trade receivables recorded by reported segment held at the 31 March were: 2014 2015 Restated m m Networks Electricity Distribution 69.4 57.8 Electricity Transmission 15.4 2.4 84.8 60.2 Retail Energy Supply 595.8 680.6 Enterprise 145.9 138.3 Energy Related Services 23.3 6.0 765.0 824.9 Wholesale Energy Portfolio Management and Electricity Generation 2,114.0 1,902.3 Gas Storage 1.5 1.5 Gas Production 0.5 0.8 2,116.0 1,904.6 Corporate Unallocated 11.7 7.8 Total 2,977.5 2,797.5 176 SSE plc Annual Report 2015 1.

Trade receivables associated with the Groups 8.6 million electricity and gas customers are recorded in this segment.
The Group also has significant receivables associated with its Wholesale activities which are generally settled within two to four weeks from invoicing.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is therefore subject to diversification with no exposure to individual retail customers totalling 10% of trade receivables.
The biggest customer balance, due from a wholesale customer also a wholesale supplier, is 11% 2014 10% of the total trade receivables.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2015 2014 m m Not past due 2,720.0 2,513.7 Past due but not individually impaired: 0 30 days 157.0 167.0 31 90 days 52.7 50.9 Over 90 days 202.1 230.3 3,131.8 2,961.9 Less: allowance for impairment 154.3 164.4 Net Trade receivables 2,977.5 2,797.5 The Group has past due debt which has not had an impairment allowance set aside to cover potential credit losses.
The Group has certain procedures to pursue customers in significant arrears and believes its impairment policy in relation to such balances is appropriate.
Those debts which are neither past due nor impaired are considered to be good and are expected to be recoverable.
The Group has other receivables which are financial assets totalling 25.2m 2014 29.1m.
The Company does not have trade receivables.
The movement in the allowance for impairment of trade receivables was: 2015 2014 m m Balance at 1 April 164.4 147.3 Increase in allowance for impairment 56.2 103.0 Impairment losses recognised 66.3 88.4 Foreign exchange movements 2.5 Balance at 31 March 154.3 164.4 At the end of each reporting period a review of the provision for bad and doubtful debts is performed.
It is an assessment of the potential amount of trade receivables which will not be paid by customers after the balance sheet date.
This amount is calculated by reference to the age, status and risk of each receivable.
ii Liquidity risk and going concern Liquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Group can be exposed to significant movements in its liquidity position due to changes in commodity prices, working capital requirements, the impact of the seasonal nature of the business and phasing of its capital investment and recycling programmes.
Treasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts.
Short term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury, while the longer term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board.
The departments operations are governed by policies determined by the Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Risk and Trading Committee and Audit Committee.
In relation to the Groups liquidity risk, the Groups policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
During the year, the Groups approach to managing liquidity was to seek to ensure that the Group had available committed borrowings and facilities equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 6 month period.
The Group uses cash flow forecasts to monitor its ongoing borrowing requirements.
Typically, the Group will fund any short term borrowing positions by issuing commercial paper or borrowing from uncommitted bank lines and will invest in money market funds when it has a cash surplus.
Details of the groups borrowings are disclosed at note 24.
In addition to the borrowing facilities listed at Note 24, the Group has 150m of uncommitted bank lines and a 15m overdraft facility.

C Cap api it ta al l an and d f fi inanc nanci ia al l r ri is sk k m mana anag ge em me en nt t c con ont tiinue nued d Over the course of the financial year to 31 March 2016, the Group has around 700m of term loans reaching maturity.
Of these loans, 200m matures in June 2015 and 500m matures in September 2015 and both have options to be extended for one year.
It is expected the lender will honour the requests to roll the term loans into the financial year to 31 March 2017.
In addition, on 10 March 2015 the Company issued new 750m and 600m hybrid capital bonds which provide appropriate cover in advance of the first issuer call date for the 2010 hybrid capital bonds.
As a consequence, it is the view of the Directors that the Groups 105% funding policy will be met out to September 2016.
Given the committed bank facilities of 1.5bn maintained by the Group and the current capital market conditions, the Directors have concluded that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have also taken into account the successful issuance of 4.5bn of medium to long term debt and hybrid capital since October 2009, and the Groups credit rating.
The statement of going concern is included in the Directors Report on page 80.
Treasury also manage the Groups interaction with its relationship banks defined as those banks that support the companys financing activities through their ongoing participation in the committed lending facilities that are maintained by the Group.
These are each allocated financial limits, subject to the maintenance of a minimum credit rating of investment grade or better allocated by a recognised major ratings group.
In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.
As at 31 March 2015, the value of outstanding cash collateral in respect of mark-to-market related margin calls on exchange traded positions was 71.7m 2014 51.2m.
The contractual cash flows shown in the following tables are the contractual undiscounted cashflows under the relevant financial instruments.
Where the contractual cashflows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate or index in the future, the contractual cashflows in the following tables have been determined with reference to the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cashflows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cashflows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the following tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
The numbers in the following tables have been included in the Groups cashflow forecasts for the purposes of considering Liquidity Risk as noted above.
It should be noted that cash flows associated with future energy sales and commodity contracts which are not IAS 39 financial instruments are not included in this analysis, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS 7.
The risk management activity carried out by EPM arises from the Groups requirement to source gas, electricity or other commodities such as renewable obligation certificates for Energy Supply, and to procure fuel and other commodities and provide a route-to-market for Electricity Generation.
The Groups strategy is to manage all exposures to commodity risk through volumetric limits and to measure the exposure by use of Value at Risk VaR models.
The exposure is subject to financial limits established by the Board and managed by reference to guidance agreed by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Exposures are reported to the Committee on a monthly basis and to the Board when certain trigger levels are exceeded.
Within this approach, only certain of the Groups energy commodity contracts are deemed to constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial commodity contracts, it is only the fair value of IAS 39 financial instruments which represents the exposure of the Groups commodity price risk under IFRS 7.
This is a consequence of the Groups accounting policy which stipulates that commodity contracts which are designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 should be accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in profit or equity.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 will be accounted for as own use contracts.
As fair value changes in own use contracts are not reflected through profit or equity, these do not represent the IFRS 7 commodity price risk.
Therefore, as the overall Group VaRs associated with commodity risk will be monitored for internal risk management purposes and is outside the scope of IAS 39.
In EPM, the economic volatility that the Group is exposed to related to this risk is managed through a selection of longer and shorter term contracts for commodities such as gas, electricity, coal and carbon allowances, the arms length arrangements with the Groups gas production business and through flexibility from the Groups fleet of generation assets including assets such as pumped storage generating plant, flexible hydro generating plant, standby oil plant and contracts with the gas storage business.
Financial Statements Financial Statements 3 32 2.. C Cap api it ta al l an and d f fi inanc nanci ia al l r ri is sk k m mana anag ge em me en nt t c con ont tiinue nued d Short-term exposures will arise from the requirement to match volumes of procured gas and electricity with demand for gas and electricity by Energy Supply customers.
In addition, exposures can arise from matching fuel and other commodity procurement with demand for these commodities arising from the Groups Generation assets.
Both can vary from expectations and result in a requirement to close the contracted positions at unfavourable prices.
Longer-term exposures are managed by EPM through longer term contracts including forwards, futures contracts and other financial instruments.
These, in turn, are used to reduce short-term market exposures.
As noted, certain commodity contracts are entered into primarily for own use purposes to supply to customers or to provide fuel to power stations.
However, as noted, a number of these contracts do not qualify for own use treatment under IAS 39 and are subject to fair value measurement through the income statement.
In addition to this, the Group enters into certain contracts to manage commodity price and volume risk.
These are also subject to fair value measurement through the income statement.
Finally, other physical contracts can be treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand.
The accounting policies associated with such items are explained in the Accompanying information section A1.
The consequential commodity risk which derives from these activities is quantified by the use of a Value at Risk VaR model which considers exposures in all commodities and provides an estimate of the potential change to the Groups forecast profits over a given period and to a given confidence level.
The calculated financial risk is controlled through the imposition of a number of risk limits approved by the Board and monitored and managed by the Risk and Trading Committee.
The Groups exposure to Commodity risk is subsequently reported to and monitored by the Risk and Trading Committee and to the Management Board by exception.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7 is measured by reference to the Groups IAS 39 commodity contracts.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for market risks that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in market variables impacting upon the fair value or cash flows associated with the Groups financial instruments.
Therefore, the sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at the balance sheet date assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant commodity price had occurred, and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date.
The reasonably possible changes in commodity prices used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on calculated or implied volatilities where available, or historical data.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated on the basis that the proportion of commodity contracts that are IAS 39 financial instruments remains consistent with those at that point.
Excluded from this analysis are all commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39.

C Cap api it ta al l an and d f fi inanc nanci ia al l r ri is sk k m mana anag ge em me en nt t c con ont tiinue nued d iv Currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling but also conducts business in foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk arising from exchange rate movements which will be reflected in the Groups transaction costs or in the underlying foreign currency assets of its foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to use forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk.
All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long term plant servicing and maintenance agreements, and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates.
The policy is to seek to hedge 100% of its currency requirements arising under all committed contracts excepting commodity hedge transactions, the requirements for which are significantly less predictable.
The policy for these latter transactions is to assess the Groups requirements on a rolling basis and to enter into cover contracts as appropriate.
The Group has foreign subsidiary operations with significant Euro-denominated net assets.
The Groups policy is to hedge its net investment in its foreign operations by ensuring the net assets whose functional currency cash flows are denominated in Euros are matched by borrowings in Euros.
For the acquired net assets whose functional cash flows are in Sterling, the Group will ensure Sterling denominated borrowings are in place to minimise currency risk.
Significant exposures are reported to, and discussed by, the Risk and Trading Committee on an ongoing basis and additionally form part of the bi-annual Treasury report to the Audit Committee.
At the balance sheet date, the total nominal value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to is: 2015 2014 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 1,735.4 1,756.8 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows: 2015 2014 DKK SEK NOK CHF DKK SEK NOK CHF m million million m US$m million million m million million m $m million million Loans and borrowings 15,000.0 1,102.4 700.0 15,000.0 1,103.5 100.0 512.3 Purchase and commodity contract commitments 2,081.8 515.7 474.2 349.2 34.6 3.5 13.8 741.3 885.3 Gross exposure 15,000.0 2,081.8 1,618.1 1,174.2 349.2 34.6 15,000.0 3.5 13.8 1,844.8 985.3 512.3 Forward exchange swap contracts 15,000.0 2,081.8 992.0 1,066.4 349.2 34.6 15,000.0 3.5 13.8 1,041.4 982.7 512.3 Net exposure in currency 626.1 107.8 803.4 2.5 Net exposure in m 452.5 72.6 663.4 1.5 This represents the net exposure to foreign currencies, reported in pounds Sterling, and arising from all Group activities.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the relative proportions of instruments in foreign currencies being consistent as at the balance sheet date.
This includes only monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than Sterling and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations but not the corresponding impact of the net investment hedge.
The sensitivity analysis is indicative only and it should be noted that the Groups exposure to such market rate changes is continually changing.
The calculations are based on linear extrapolations of rate changes which may not reflect the actual result which would impact upon the Group.

v Interest rate risk Interest rate risk derives from the Groups exposure to changes in the value of an asset or liability or future cash flows through changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage this risk by stipulating that a minimum of 50% of Group borrowings be subject to fixed rates of interest, either directly through the debt instruments themselves or through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The floating rate borrowings are provided by banks including the European Investment Bank.
Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than Sterling, cross currency swaps.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Groups financial performance.
Although interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings.
Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades.
The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise cash advances from the European Investment Bank.
The impact of a change in interest rates is dependent on the specific details of the financial asset or liability in question.
Changes in fixed rate financial assets and liabilities, which account for the majority of cash, loans and borrowings, are not measured at fair value through the income statement.
In addition to this, changes to fixed-to-floating hedging instruments which are recorded under cash flow hedge accounting also do not impact the income statement.
Changes in variable rate instruments and hedging instruments and hedged items recorded under fair value hedge accounting are recorded through the income statement.
The exposure measured is therefore based on variable rate debt and instruments.
The net exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date can be summarised thus: 2014 2015 Carrying Carrying amount amount Restated m m Interest bearing earning assets and liabilities: fixed 4,983.4 4,987.3 floating 79.3 1,130.9 4,904.1 6,118.2 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents 1,512.3 458.9 Derivative financial liabilities 284.8 238.7 Loans and borrowings 5,811.9 6,009.5 Finance lease obligations 319.7 328.9 4,904.1 6,118.2 Following from this, the table below represents the expected impact of a change of 100 basis points in short term interest rates at the reporting date in relation to equity and income statement.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
An increase in exchange rates would be a change to either the income statement or equity.
The assessment is based on a revision of the fair value assumptions included in the calculated exposures in the previous table.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the proportion of fixed to floating instruments being consistent as at the balance sheet date and is stated after the effect of taxation.

2015 2014 m m Income statement 12.3 12.6 12.3 12.6 The impact of a decrease in rates would be an identical reduction in the annual charge.
There is no impact on equity as the analysis relates to the Groups net exposure at the balance sheet date.
Contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are, by definition, part of the groups covered position.
vi Primary statement disclosures For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, coal and carbon.
Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and nonhedge accounted foreign exchange contracts.
Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.
The net movement reflected in the income statement can be summarised thus: 2015 2014 m m Operating Derivatives Total result on operating derivatives i 1,073.5 785.4 Less: Amounts settled ii 1,005.7 634.5 Movement in unrealised derivatives 67.8 150.9 Financing Derivatives and hedged items Total result on financing derivatives i 395.5 754.7 Less: Amounts settled ii 351.3 690.5 Movement in unrealised derivatives 44.2 64.2 Net income statement impact 112.0 215.1 i Total result on derivatives in the income statement represents the total amounts charged or credited to the income statement in respect of operating and financial derivatives.
ii Amounts settled in the year represent the result on derivatives transacted which have matured or been delivered and have been included within the total result on derivatives.
The derivative financial assets and liabilities are represented as follows: 2015 2014 m m Derivative Financial Assets Non-current 566.8 368.4 Current 1,999.9 1,261.2 2,566.7 1,629.6 Derivative Liabilities Non-current 933.4 681.7 Current 2,297.3 1,470.2 Total derivative liabilities 3,230.7 2,151.9 Net liability 664.0 522.3 Fair Value Hierarchy The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Oil and coal commodities reported as level 2 for the year ended 31 March 2014 assets of 316.8m and liabilities of 319.4m are now classified as level 1, following a reassessment of assets and liabilities by the Group.
vii Cash flow hedges The Group designates contracts which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes either as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.
Cash flow hedges are contracts entered into to hedge a forecast transaction or cash flow risk generally arising from a change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates and which meet the effectiveness criteria prescribed by IAS 39.
The Groups accounting policy on cash flow hedges is explained in the Accompanying Information section A1.
The following table indicates the contractual maturities of the expected transactions and the qualifying cash flow hedges associated: Cash flow hedges 2015 2015 2015 2014 2014 2014 Carrying Expected 0-12 2015 2015 2015 Carrying Expected 0-12 2014 2014 2014 amount cash flows months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years amount cash flows months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Forward exchange contracts: Assets 12.0 139.6 47.2 45.2 39.0 8.2 5.0 102.6 42.0 32.5 27.5 0.6 Liabilities 62.0 558.0 279.8 174.6 103.6 13.0 434.4 173.6 177.4 60.7 22.7 50.0 697.6 327.0 219.8 142.6 8.2 8.0 537.0 215.6 209.9 88.2 23.3 viii Net investment hedge The Groups net investment hedge consists of debt issued in the same currency as the net investment in foreign subsidiaries with denominated functional currencies being the Airtricity Supply business, the thermal plants in Ireland and the Ireland wind farm portfolio.
The hedge compares the element of the net assets whose functional cash flows are denominated in to the matching portion of the borrowings held by the Group.
This therefore provides protection against movements in foreign exchange rates.
Gains and losses in the hedge are recognised in equity and will be transferred to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation 2015 48.7m gain, 2014 12.5m gain.
Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the income statement 2015 nil, 2014 nil.
