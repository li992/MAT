The incremental amortisation charge resulting from this change has been presented as an exceptional item in 2014 and in 2015, given its material scale.
2 As a result of HM Treasurys announcement in March 2014 of an increase in Machine Games Duty, the Group closed a portfolio of 108 shops during 2014 and provided for onerous leases and other expenses.
The Group has exited a number of these leases in the period and the difference between provisions held and any final settlement is credited or charged to exceptional items, consistently with the original provisions.

These fees are presented as exceptional, consistently with the original refund and associated items.
4 During 2015, the Group released certain historical provisions for corporation tax, following resolution of discussions with a tax authority.
This release has been presented as an exceptional item, due to its scale.
