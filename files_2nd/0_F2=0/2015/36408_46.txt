The total fees, including the fee for this assignment, earned by CBRE or other companies forming part of the same group of companies within the UK from the Group is less than 5.0% of total UK revenues.
The principal signatories of the CBRE valuation reports have continuously been the signatories of valuations for the same addressee and valuation purpose as this report since 2012.
CBRE has continuously been carrying out valuation instructions for the Group for in excess of20 years.
CBRE has carried out valuation, agency and professional services on behalf of the Group for in excess of 20 years.
Real estate valuations are complex and derived using comparable market transactions which are not publicly available and involve an element of judgement.
Therefore, in line with EPRA guidance, we have classied the valuation of the property portfolio as Level 3 as dened by IFRS 13.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Inputs to the valuation, including capitalisation yields typicallythe true equivalent yield and rental values, are dened as unobservable as dened by IFRS 13.

However, the relationship between capitalisation yields and the property valuation is negative: therefore an increase in capitalisation yields will reduce the valuation of a property and vice versa.
There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are determined by market conditions and the valuation movement in any one period depends on the balance between them.
If these inputs move in opposite directions i. e. rental values increase and yields decrease valuation movements can be amplied whereas if they move in the same direction they may offset reducing the overall net valuation movement.
At 31 March 2015, the Group had capital commitments of 324.6 million 2014: 54.4 million.
