Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES continued For the 52 weeks ended 3 October 2015 34 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS On 9 August 2005 the Group entered into a Tax Deed of Covenant, which was amended on 22 November 2007, the primary objective of which was to ensure that the Group did not trigger a fide-grouping liability comprising Capital Gains Tax CGT and Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT.
This would arise in the event of Marstons Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group, within six years of the relevant asset transfer date for CGT purposes, and within three years of the relevant asset transfer date for SDLT purposes.
Due to the passage of time and changes in the statutory rate of corporation tax, the total potential fide-grouping liability now stands at 6.8 million 2014: 8.4 million, of which 6.3 million 2014: 7.9 million relates to CGT and 0.5 million 2014: 0.5 million relates toSDLT.
The Group has issued a letter of credit in favour of Royal Sun Alliance Insurance totalling 1.6 million 2014: 1.4 million and a letter of credit in favour of Aviva totalling 1.0 million 2014: 1.0 million to secure reinsurance contracts.
The letters of credit are secured on xed deposits for the same amount.
The Group has also entered into a Deed of Guarantee with the Trustees of the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme whereby it guarantees to the Trustees the ongoing obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme, and the obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme in the event of a debt becoming due under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 on the occurrence of either a Group company entering liquidation or the Scheme winding up.
35 THWAITES ACQUISITION On 17 April 2015, the Group acquired the trading operations of Daniel Thwaites PLCs beer division, including the two leading beer brands Wainwright and Lancaster Bomber.
The acquisition is consistent with the Groups strategy to focus on popular premium ale brands, and provides further opportunities for growth in the developing free trade market.
The table below summarises the consideration paid, the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill.
2015 m Brands 12.8 Property, plant and equipment 6.1 Trade loans 3.0 Inventories 2.9 Trade and other receivables 1.1 Trade and other payables 0.4 Goodwill 3.3 Cash consideration 28.8 All of the goodwill arising is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition related costs of 0.2 million have been recognised within other net operating charges.
If the acquisition date had been the beginning of the current period then the underlying revenue and profit of the Group for the current period would have been 868.2 million and 76.1 million respectively.
Since acquisition the Group has integrated the operations of the acquired business into the Groups existing operations.
As a result it is impractical to isolate the revenue and profit of the acquired business that has been included in the Group statement of comprehensive income since the acquisition date.
