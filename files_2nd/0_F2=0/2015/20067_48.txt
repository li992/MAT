Goodwill impairment review The group performs an annual goodwill impairment review, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services, BT Business and BT Consumer.
These are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Global Services BT Business BT Consumer Total a a Restated Restated m m m m At 1 April 2013 1,132 221 65 1,418 Acquisition note 13 15 15 Disposals and adjustments 12 12 Exchange differences 75 7 82 At 1 April 2014 1,045 214 80 1,339 Exchange differences 59 6 65 At 31 March 2015 1,104 220 80 1,404 a Due to the move of BT Conferencing from BT Business to BT Global Services see notes 1 and 4, goodwill of 7m has been allocated from BT Business to BT Global Services on the basis of relative fair values.
The discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2014 15 was 9.3% 2013 14: 9.6% for all CGUs.
The perpetuity growth rate for BTGlobal Services was 2.2% 2013 14: 2.5% and 2.0% 2013 14: 2.0% for BT Business and BT Consumer.

Intangible assets continued Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the BT Group plc Board covering a three-year period.
They reflect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows are also adjusted downwards to reflect the different risk attributes of each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that sector.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
Sensitivities There is significant headroom in all CGUs.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 5,417m.
Thefollowing changes in combination in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value: reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.2% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 0% no growth an increase in the discount rate from the 9.3% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 15% or more shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 180m or more in perpetuity.
For BT Business and BT Consumer no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
