128 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 19 Financial instruments continued The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers, which include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made: past due up to one month 146m 2014: 136m : past due two to three months 76m 2014: 66m : past due four to six months 40m 2014: 30m : and past due greater than six months 17m 2014: 7m.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the creditworthiness of the customer and where the history ofdealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.
