The following amounts represent a provisional determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the one year measurement period as required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The size and complexity of the Fokker acquisition along with proximity to the reporting date will necessitate the use of this measurement period to further analyse and assess a number of factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date including contractual and operational factors underlying the customer related intangible assets, the assumptions underpinning certain provisions such as those for legal claims and the related tax impacts of any changes made.
Any potential adjustments could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented on page 157.
