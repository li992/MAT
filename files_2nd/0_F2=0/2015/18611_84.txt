PENSION COSTS Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Pension arrangements for Directors are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee and the Directors remuneration report on pages 55 to 73.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the Group.
The charge of 1.0m 2014: 1.0m is included within employee remuneration in Note 12.
Defined benefit scheme In addition to the above, the Group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by Trustees and are invested with Friends Life, an independent investment manager.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement date or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running the scheme in accordance with the schemes trust deed and rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the scheme are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme.
There is a requirement that at least one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members: Active members: currently employed by the Group.
Note no benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003, although active members retain a final salary link: Deferred members: former employees of the Group: and Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the statement of financial position date.
In the period up to retirement, benefits receive increases linked to CPI inflation subject to a cap of no more than 5% p. a.. After retirement, benefits receive fixed increases of 5% p. a.
The valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the schemes defined benefit obligation as at 30 September 2015 was 17 years.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the results of the actuarial valuation carried out as at 1 July 2013, updated to 30 September 2015, by a qualified independent actuary.

These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the schemes defined benefit obligation, however, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk: some of the schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy: if scheme members live longer than expected, the schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the schemes defined benefit obligation.
The trustees and Group manage risks in the scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.

Future funding obligation The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed by the Actuary for the Trustees as at 1 July 2013.
This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of 4.4m.
As a result of this valuation, the Group agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to pay additional contributions to eliminate the deficit by 31 January 2020.
Based on this plan, theCompany expects to pay 0.6m p. a. to the scheme, including the standard expense charges payable under the managed fund policy, until 31 January 2020.
