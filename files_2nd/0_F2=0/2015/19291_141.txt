The fide ned bene t section of the UK Group plan is a final salary pension plan which provides bene ts to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of bene ts depends on the length of service and final pensionable pay.
The UK Group plan is funded with bene t payments from trustee administered funds.
