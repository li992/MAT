In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill of 26.6 million 2014: 26.6million forthe purpose of impairment testing has been allocatedto the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell UK partofMDD Europe and AsiaPacific Division.
The recoverable amounts have been measured based on value in use.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations, which were performed for the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell UK, based on data available at the mid-point of the financial year, were as follows: sales growth for the current year was based on internal forecasts with growth in the five subsequent years broadly in line with historic UK GDP and a terminal growth rate of 2.5% 2014: 2.5% : gross margins were projected based on recent trends: and a market risk premium, of 4.0% 2014: 5.0%, was used in calculating the weighted average cost of capital.
Forecast cash flows have been prepared for a period of five years.
From the second year onwards, the rate of growth used does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the industry in which the business operates.
The pre-tax cash flows that these projections produce have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 12.1% 2014: 11.9%.
No impairment arose during the current financial year as a result of this test.
The remaining goodwill of 20.5 million 2014: 11.7 million is allocated across six 2014: five different cash generating units.
Impairment tests have been performed on the other amounts based on value in use and using similar assumptions to that above.
No impairments arose during the year in relation to these amounts.
The Directors believe there are no reasonably possible changes to a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.
