156 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financials EPRA performance measures 1.
INTRODUCTION The EPRA Best Practice Recommendations EPRA BPR were issued by EPRAs Reporting and Accounting Committee in August 2011 and the guidance has subsequently been updated in December 2014.
Included within EPRA BPR are six EPRA Performance Measures deemed to be of key importance to investors in property companies and which aim to encourage more consistent and widespread disclosure.
The EPRA Performance Measures are set out below: Performance measure Definition 1 EPRA Earnings Recurring earnings from core operational activities.
This is a key measure of a companys underlying operating results providing an indication of the extent to which current dividend payments are supported by earnings.
2 EPRA NAV Net asset value adjusted to include properties and other investment interests at fair value and to exclude certain items not expected to crystallise in a long-term property business model.
This measure is consistent with NAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 4 to the Group financial statements.
3 EPRA NNNAV EPRA NAV adjusted to include the fair values of i financial instruments, ii debt and iii deferred taxes.
This measure is consistent with NNNAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 4 to the Group financial statements.
4i EPRA Net Initial Yield NIY Annualised rental income based on cash rents at the balance sheet date, less non-recoverable property expenses, divided by the market value of the property, increased with estimated purchasers costs.
4ii EPRA topped-up yield This measure incorporates an adjustment to EPRA NIY in respect of the expiration of rent-free periods or other unexpired lease incentives such as discounted rent periods and step rents.
5 EPRA Vacancy Rate Estimated Market Rent Value ERV of vacant space divided by ERV of the whole portfolio.
6 EPRA Cost Ratios This measure includes all administrative and operating expenses including share of joint ventures overheads and operating expenses, net of any service fees, all divided by gross rental income.
Grainger is supportive of EPRAs initiative and, in this report, is disclosing against five of the EPRA measures, EPRA Earnings, EPRA Net Asset Value NAV and EPRA Triple Net Asset Value NNNAV, EPRA Net Initial Yield NIY and EPRA Vacancy Rate.
EPRA topped-up NIY is not appropriate to Graingers business.
The EPRA Cost Ratios, too, is less relevant to Grainger as it is distorted by the fact that in our reversionary portfolio rental levels range between a sub-market rent are a zero rent.
The Group continues to disclose other KPIs and operational measures in this report, including an efficiency ratio which measures administrative and operating costs, net of fee income, asa proportion of the value of assets under management, which it believes are more appropriate to its business and these are shown in the Strategic report.
In relation to EPRA NIY and EPRA vacancy rate, the figures shown are in respect of the Grainger wholly-owned market rented assets only.
Not included in these numbers are Graingers wholly-owned reversionary assets or any assets within joint ventures or associates.

The 2015 vacancy rate is adversely impacted by a higher than normal level of vacancies in Germany as we upgrade our FRM portfolio.

Therefore, it is not appropriate to show any measure of earnings that excludes profit on sale of trading property and so no adjustment has been made for this in the table above.
The adjustment made in this item relates to an impairment provision made against trading stock 2014: reversal of an impairment provision.

The Grainger measures of NAV and NAV per share disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements is equal to the EPRA NAV presented above.
The adjustment to add the value of the Groups own shares is recognised as these shares do have a market value and this has been the historical basis of the Groups calculation.
In addition, the number of shares used in the NAV calculation is the total number of shares in issue including those held by the Company in treasury or trust for the purposes of settling future share awards.
This should be a close representation of the fully diluted number of shares and so is very unlikely to produce materially different NAV measures.
