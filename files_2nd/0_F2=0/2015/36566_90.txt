Share-based payments continued Founder Long-term incentive scheme Founder LTIP The Founders and Joint Chief Executives are entitled to a share award dependant on the growth in EPRA NAV.
The target for the Founder LTIP is that EPRA NAV per ordinary share after adding back dividends and other returns to shareholders must exceed a compound growth rate of 10% per annum in a three-year period.
The Founder LTIP scheme has repeated to reward performance in each three-year period: the current performance period ended on 31 December 2015.
The value of the share award for each Chief Executive is calculated as 12.5% of the excess growth over the 10% growth target.
Any amount payable under the Founder LTIP is to be satisfied by the award of ordinary shares of the Company.
The price per share to be used when determining the number of shares which the Joint Chief Executives are entitled to is 111.955p being the average mid-market quotation for such shares on the Main Market for the first 20 dealing days immediately following the end of the relevant period.
The excess growth in EPRA NAV over the performance target over the performance period was 51.3million and as such each Chief Executive is entitled to 22,906,127 ordinary shares in the Company.
The total share-based payment charge for the year under this scheme was 18.9 million with associated social security costs of 4.3 million 2014: 11.1 million with associated social security costs of 2.5 million.
Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP awards share options with a nil exercise price to executive directors and senior employees.
The number of options granted is calculated with reference to the employees salary and the share price prior to the grant date.
To reflect the fact that 2012 was a transitional year between the 2005 Share Option Scheme and the PSP, two awards were granted to participants, one with a two-year performance period and one with a three-year performance period.
Vesting of the awards is staggered over the three years following the performance period, with one third vesting each year if performance targets are met.
Performance targets are based on Total Shareholder Return and Net Asset Value growth relative to a peer group of listed UK REITs.
