2014 Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the trade and assets of a wine and spirits business in Africa.
The residual value of the net assets acquired hasbeen recognised as goodwill of US$7 million in the financial statements.
The fair value exercise in respect of this business combination is nowcomplete.
Goodwill is monitored principally on an individual country basis and the net book value is allocated by cash generating unit CGU as follows.

Goodwill continued Assumptions The group uses both value in use and fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD calculations to determine the recoverable amounts for its CGUs.
Seenote 1 for the detailed accounting policy on how the group determines recoverable value.
The key assumptions for the discounted cash flow calculations are as follows.
Expected volume five-year compound annual growth rate CAGR Cash flows are based on financial forecasts approved by management for each CGU covering five-year periods and are dependent on managements expected volume CAGRs which have been determined based on past experience and planned initiatives, and with reference to external sources in respect of macro-economic assumptions.
Expected growth rates over the five-year forecast period are generally higher than the long-term average growth rates for the economies in which the CGUs operate as asteady state is not necessarily expected to be reached in this period.
The cash flow forecasts included in FVLCD calculations are based on managements best estimates of expected volume CAGRs and incorporate cash flows associated with enhancing the assets performance, such ascapital expenditure, where appropriate in order to determine the FVLCD from a market participants perspective.
Discount rate The discount rate weighted average cost of capital is calculated using a methodology which reflects the returns from United States Treasury notes with a maturity of 20 years, an equity risk premium adjusted for specific industry and country risks, and inflation differentials.
The group applies local post-tax discount rates to local post-tax cash flows.
For a value in use calculation, where a potential impairment is identified on apost-tax basis, the impairment review is reperformed on a pre-tax basis.
Long-term growth rate Cash flows after the first five-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate, in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount.
The long-term growth rate is estimated using historical trends and expected future trends in inflation rates, based onexternal data.
The following table presents the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations in each of the groups operating segments and relate only to subsidiaries of the group.

Impairment reviews results An impairment charge of US$313 million has been recognised in respect of the India CGU in Asia Pacific.
This primarily reflected the groups assessment of the increasing regulatory and excise challenges in the operating environment in India and the proposed partial introduction of a national goods and services tax GST which will not apply to beer so that GST on input costs is not expected to be recoverable.
The impairment losswas allocated to goodwill US$286 million, property, plant and equipment US$23 million, and intangible assets US$4 million.
The recoverable amount of the CGU was based on its value in use, which was determined using a discounted cash flow calculation.
In arriving at value in use, apre-tax discount rate of 14.1% 2014: 13.4% was applied to pre-tax cash flows.
Sensitivities to assumptions The groups impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in the key assumptions described above.
The most material goodwill balance is in Australia.
In addition to the volume CAGR, pricing, mix and cost efficiencies are significant factors influencing the recoverable value of the CGU, and therefore NPR and EBITA CAGRs were also considered key assumptions in the discounted cash flow calculation.
Continuing market weakness in Australia has reduced the forecast volume and revenue growth assumptions used in determining therecoverable amount of the Australia CGU.
The estimated recoverable amount was calculated on a FVLCD basis and is now approximately US$650 million higher than the carrying value of the CGU.
For the recoverable amount to reduce to a level such that it is equal to the carrying value of the CGU, the following would need to occur: the future compound annual NPR growth over the five-year forecast period to reduce to a level such that the EBITA CAGR over the same period of 3.8% would fall below the long-term growth rate of 2.8%: or the long-term growth rate of 2.8% in nominal terms to fallbelow 2.4%: or the discount rate to rise from 7.4% to 7.7% or higher.
These changes in assumptions are considered reasonably possible in the current environment.
Based on the groups sensitivity analysis, areasonably possible change in a single assumption will not cause an impairment loss in any of the groups other CGUs.
