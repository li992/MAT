This latter item also includes impairment charges of 36.2m in relation to system and software development across the energy supply and metering businesses.
Other exceptional charges of 137.4m were recognised in the previous financial year.
This included charges of 91.0m in relation to the March 2014 restructuring announcement, including a restructuring provision primarily relating to the scheme of employee voluntary early release of 52.9m and provisions associated with business closures and contractual disputes of 82.6m.
6.2 Certain re-measurements Certain re-measurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
This category includes the movement on derivatives and hedged items as described in note 32.
Only certain of the Groups energy commodity contracts are deemed to constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial commodity contracts, it is only commodity contracts that are designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 that are accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in the income statement as part of certain re-measurements or in other comprehensive income.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
6.3 Change in UK corporation tax rates Finance Act 2015 which received royal assent on 26 March 2015 announced that the rate of Supplementary Charge SCT was reduced to 20% previously 32% with effect from 1 January 2015.
This results in a hybrid SCT rate of 29% for the Groups upstream oil and gas operations for the year to 31 March 2015 2014 32%.
Finance Act 2015 also enacted a reduction in the rate of Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT to 35% from 1 January 2016 from the current 50%.
As these changes have been substantively enacted they have the effect of reducing the groups deferred tax liabilities by 15.6m.
