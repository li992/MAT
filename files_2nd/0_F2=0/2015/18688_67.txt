Financial policies for risk management and their objectives continued The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value: Cash and cash equivalents due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments and given that generally they have negligible credit risk, management considers the carrying amounts to be not significantly different from their fair values: Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments: Long-term loans the majority of the loans are variable rate and re-price in response to any changes in market rates and so management considers the carrying amount to be not significantly different from their fair market value.
For fixed-rate loan exposures, fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities of such loans: Over the counter OTC derivative contracts may include forward, swap, and option contracts relating to interest rates or foreign currencies and are valued based on level 2 market prices and prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date: Receivables and payables the fair values of receivables and payables are estimated to be equal to the respective carrying amounts: and Lease obligations are valued at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
