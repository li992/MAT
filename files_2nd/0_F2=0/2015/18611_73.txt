We are assessing the long-term impact with our advisers and aim to collaborate with other affected owners in the area as well as with HS2 Ltd, the company responsible for developing and promoting this new rail link.
HS2 remains a clear policy from the government.
HS2 Ltd continue to discuss the planned rail link with the government and communities affected by the proposed route.
Changes to the HS2 Hybrid Bill are being considered by the HS2 Select Committee as a result of these discussions and consultations.
Royal Assent of the HS2 Hybrid Bill could be sought in late 2016 or early 2017 although there is still uncertainty around the exact timing.

We have no current view from advisers on possible CPO value.
As a result of the continuing uncertainty around the CPO process, the Group has decided to further impair its investment in Curzon Park Limited.
The Group has made a further provision in 2015 of 3.2m 2014: nil to write down its investment to 4.8m 2014: 8.0m.
The value of 4.8m has been provided by CBRE Limited, the Groups external, independent valuers for its development assets.
This is based on the value the site may have as a development opportunity discounted to reflect the uncertainty around HS2 and the CPO process.
The companies in Prague in which the Group holds a 50% equity stake have received planning permission to develop a site at Zizkov in the suburbs of Prague.
However, a challenge has been made contesting the permission granted.
As a result of the challenge, the Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the investment for future impairment.
Given the considerable time it has taken to reach the current planning position and the on-going uncertainties, the Group has made a provision of 0.9m 2014: 2.4m against the further investment made during 2015 to retain the carrying value at nil.
