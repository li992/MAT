150 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1 Segment reporting IFRS 8 requires segment reporting to be based on the internal financial information reported to the chief operating decision maker.
The groups chief operating decision maker is deemed to be the executive committee comprising both Peter Crook Chief Executive and Andrew Fisher Finance Director whose primary responsibility it is to manage the groups day-to-day operations and analyse trading performance.
The groups segments comprise Vanquis Bank, CCD, Moneybarn and Central which are those segments reported in the groups management accounts used by the executive committee as the primary means for analysing trading performance.
The executive committee assesses profit performance using profit before tax measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the group financial statements.

Exceptional costs in 2014 of 7.3m comprised: i 3.4m of business restructuring costs in CCD representing 4.0m of redundancy costs associated with 225 field administration employees following the ongoing deployment of technology in CCD, net of a 0.6m exceptional curtailment credit associated with those employees made redundant who were part of the groups defined benefit pension scheme see note 20 : and ii 3.9m of expenses incurred in relation to the acquisition of Moneybarn see note 10.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.
Revenue between business segments is not material.
The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to CCD of 76.2m 2014: 60.4m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.
Financial statements 151 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 1 Segment reporting continued The groups businesses operate principally in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
Vanquis Bank established a branch in Poland as part of a pilot operation during the first half of 2012.
A decision was taken to withdraw from the pilot operation in early 2015 and the receivables book was sold to a third party with the economic interest transferring from 1 April 2015.
The revenue in respect of the branch in 2015 up until the point at which the economic interest was transferred amounted to 1.8m 2014: 5.2m and the loss amounted to 1.8m 2014: 10.6m.
The net liabilities of the branch amounted to nil at 31 December 2015 2014: 18.7m, comprising assets of nil 2014: 22.3m and liabilities of nil 2014: 41.0m.
These figures are included within the Vanquis Bank figures in the tables opposite.
The acquired intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships is held on consolidation and, therefore, the amortisation charge has been allocated to Central in the above analysis, consistent with the net asset analysis.
2 Revenue Revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate EIR to the carrying value of a loan.
The EIR is calculated at inception and represents the rate which exactly discounts the future contractual cash receipts from a loan to the amount of cash advanced under that loan, plus directly attributable issue costs eg aggregator broker fees.
In addition, in CCD and Moneybarn the EIR takes account of customers repaying early.
Group 2015 2014 m m Interest income 967.8 942.0 Fee income 145.3 133.7 Total revenue 1,113.1 1,075.7 All fee income earned relates to Vanquis Bank.
Interest income relates to the interest charges on Vanquis Bank credit cards and Moneybarn conditional sale agreements and the service charge on home credit and Satsuma loans.
Fee income relates to Vanquis Bank and predominantly reflects default and over-limit fees as well as other ancillary income streams such as interchange income and Repayment Option Plan ROP fees.
Fee income in 2015 represented 26% 2014: 28% of Vanquis Bank revenue.

This primarily reflects the development of the retail deposits programme in Vanquis Bank during 2015.
Retail deposits represent approximately 46% of the groups funding at the end of 2015 compared with approximately 38% in 2014.
The all-in blended cost of taking retail deposits in 2015, after the cost of holding a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources in adherence with the PRAs liquidity regime, was 3.1% 2014: 3.4%.
Interest cover continues to be one of the groups banking covenants.
It is calculated as profit before tax, interest and amortisation divided by finance costs, excluding net hedge ineffectiveness, and has a minimum requirement of 2.0 times.
Interest cover, prior to exceptional costs, in2015 was 4.8 times compared with 4.1 times in 2014.

The tax credit in respect of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles amounted to 1.5m 2014: 0.6m.
The effective tax rate for 2015 prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs, is 20.25% 2014: 21.5% in line with the UK statutory corporation tax rate which reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
Financial statements 153 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 5 Tax charge continued During 2015, further reductions in corporation tax rates were enacted, reducing the mainstream corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% from 1 April 2020.
In addition, the Government introduced a bank corporation tax surcharge, enacted in the 2015 Finance No.
2 Act, which imposes, with effect from 1 January 2016, an additional 8% corporation tax on profits of banking companies over 25m.
Vanquis Bank is a banking company for these purposes.
As the temporary differences on which deferred tax is calculated are expected to largely reverse after 1 April 2020 2014: 1 April 2015, deferred tax at 31 December 2015 has been re-measured at 18% 2014: 20% and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream corporation tax and bank surcharge rate of 26% 2014: 20%.
In 2015, movements in the deferred tax balances have been measured at the mainstream corporation tax for the year of 20.25%.
A tax credit in 2015 of 2.4m 2014: credit of 1.3m represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of these changes and an additional deferred tax charge of 0.2m 2014: credit of 0.3m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in respect of items previously reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

Subject to regulatory approvals, the group expects to sell its shareholding in Visa Europe Limited to Visa Inc. in exchange for upfront cash proceeds, preferred stock and deferred cash consideration contingent on performance.
Deferred tax has been measured initially at the statutory rate forthe year of 20.25%.
Deferred tax has then been re-measured at the combined mainstream corporation tax and bank surcharge rates of 28% on that element of the profit attributed to the upfront cash consideration which will be taxed in 2016.
Deferred tax on the profit attributable to the preferred stock has been re-measured at 26% as this is not expected to be taxed until the preferred stock or the shares intowhich they convert are sold.
The rate of tax charge on the profit before taxation for the year is in line with 2014: higher than the average standard rate of corporation tax inthe UK of 20.25% 2014: 21.50%.
This can be reconciled as follows: Group 2015 2014 m m Profit before taxation 273.6 224.6 Profit before taxation multiplied by the average standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20.25% 2014: 21.50% 55.4 48.3 Effects of: benefit of lower tax rates overseas 0.5 0.6 adjustment in respect of prior years 2.6 1.4 non deductible general expenses 0.3 0.4 non deductible expenses relating to the acquisition of Moneybarn 0.8 impact of change in UK tax rate 2.4 1.3 Total tax charge 55.4 49.0 The profits of the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland have been taxed at the Republic of Ireland statutory tax rate of 12.5% 2014: 12.5% rather than the UK statutory tax rate of 20.25% 2014: 21.50% giving rise to a beneficial impact on the group tax charge of 0.5m 2014: 0.6m.
The 2.6m charge 2014: 1.4m charge in respect of prior years represents an increase in the prior year tax charge in respect of historic tax liabilities net of the benefit of securing tax deductions for employee share awards which are higher than those originally anticipated.
The 2.4m credit in 2015 arises as a result of re-measuring deferred tax assets in Vanquis Bank mainly provisions for costs which are tax deductible in future periods at the combined mainstream corporation tax and bank surcharge rate of 26%, having been previously measured at 20%, together with the impact of re-measuring net deferred tax liabilities elsewhere in the group at 18% 2014: 20%.
For 2014, the 1.3m credit arose primarily as a result of re-measuring the net deferred tax liabilities which arose in 2014 mainly the deferred tax liability recognised on the fair value of Moneybarns broker relationships at 20% having been originally measured at the 2014 statutory corporation taxrate of 21.5%.
During 2014, the group incurred 3.9m of expenses in relation to the acquisition of Moneybarn which were included in exceptional costs.
As it was considered tax deductions may not be available for such costs, these gave rise to an increase in the tax charge of 0.8m in 2014.
154 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 6 Earnings per share The group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data on its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for treasury shares own shares held.
Diluted EPS calculates the effect on EPS assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated as follows: i For share awards outstanding under performance-related share incentive schemes such as the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number of shares which would be issuable if: i the end of the reporting period is assumed to be the end of the schemes performance period: and ii the performance targets have been met as at that date.
ii For share options outstanding under non-performance related schemes such as the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of share options outstanding, with the difference being the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group also presents an adjusted EPS, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Reconciliations of basic and diluted earnings per share are set out below: 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount Group m m pence m m pence Earnings per share Shares in issue during the year 146.9 142.3 Own shares held 3.2 3.5 Basic earnings per share 218.2 143.7 151.8 175.6 138.8 126.5 Dilutive effect of share options and awards 2.0 2.0 2.2 2.0 Diluted earnings per share 218.2 145.7 149.8 175.6 141.0 124.5 The directors have elected to show an adjusted earnings per share prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles which arose on the acquisition of Moneybarn in August 2014 see note 10 and prior to exceptional costs see note 1.
This is presented to show the earnings per share generated by the groups underlying operations.
A reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share to adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount Group m m pence m m pence Basic earnings per share 218.2 143.7 151.8 175.6 138.8 126.5 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles, net of tax 6.0 4.2 1.9 1.4 Exceptional costs, net of tax 9.4 6.6 6.5 4.7 Adjusted basic earnings per share 233.6 143.7 162.6 184.0 138.8 132.6 Diluted earnings per share 218.2 145.7 149.8 175.6 141.0 124.5 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles, net of tax 6.0 4.1 1.9 1.4 Exceptional costs, net of tax 9.4 6.4 6.5 4.6 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 233.6 145.7 160.3 184.0 141.0 130.5 Adjusted basic EPS has grown by 22.6% in 2015 primarily due to the strong performance of Vanquis Bank.
This growth is lower than the 25.0% growth in profit before tax, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs as a result of the 5.9m placement of shares for the acquisition of Moneybarn in August 2014, partly offset by the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% on 1 April 2015.

If approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on 5 May 2016, this dividend will be paid on 24 June 2016 to shareholders who are on the register of members at 20 May 2016.
This dividend is not reflected in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 as it is subject to shareholder approval.
As a result of adjusted EPS growth of 22.6% in 2015, the directors have proposed an increase in the final dividend of 26.6% which, together with the 15.0% increase in the interim dividend, makes a total full-year dividend increase of 22.6%.
Accordingly, dividend cover, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs, in 2015 was 1.35 times 2014: 1.35 times, compared with the minimum target of 1.25 times.
8 Directors remuneration The remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24, Related party disclosures.
Group and company 2015 2014 m m Short-term employee benefits 3.4 3.6 Post-employment benefits 0.3 0.4 Share-based payment charge 4.3 3.7 Total 8.0 7.7 The directors remuneration above reflects: Short-term employee benefits comprise salary fees, bonus and benefits earned in the year.
Post-employment benefits represent the sum of: i the increase in the transfer value of the accrued pension benefits less directors contributions for those directors who are members of the groups defined benefit pension scheme: ii company contributions into personal pension arrangements for all other directors: and iii amounts accrued under the Unfunded, Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS.
The share-based payment charge is the proportion of the groups share-based payment charge that relates to those options and awards granted to the directors.
This differs to the directors remuneration report on pages 114 to 132 which does not include the share-based payment charge of 4.3m 2014: 3.7m but includes the value of LTIS and PSP share awards due to vest in 2016 of 9.0m 2014: 6.6m.
The value is calculated assuming 100% of share awards vest at the average share price during the last threemonths of the year.

It does not include the 5,500 self-employed agents within CCD.
The 9% reduction in CCD employee numbers reflects the impact of the business restructuring which took place during 2014 and 2015 partly offset by additional headcount to support: i increased regulation and compliance: and ii the development of Satsuma and glo.
Vanquis Bank employee numbers have increased by 28% during 2015 due to the growth of the business, including the continued expansion of the second contact centre in CCDs head office in Bradford and resource to support collections activity for Satsuma.
Moneybarns 25% increase in headcount reflects the resource required to support the growth of the business and bring governance processes into line with the rest of the group.

The increase in the share-based payment charge from 8.7m in 2014 to 10.5m in 2015 primarily reflects higher expected vesting of LTIS schemes based on the groups current performance.
The share-based payment charge of 11.7m 2014: 8.7m relates to equity settled schemes of 10.5m 2014: 8.7m and cash settled schemes of 1.2m 2014: nil.
Financial statements 157 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 10 Acquisition of Moneybarn The group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Duncton Group Limited, which trades as Moneybarn, the UKs largest non-standard vehicle finance business, on 20 August 2014 for a consideration of 120m.
The consideration was satisfied by the payment of 120m in cash on completion to Duncton Group Limiteds shareholders, funded through the proceeds of a placing of 5.9m new ordinary shares in Provident Financial plc with institutional investors.
Costs of 3.9m associated with the acquisition including due diligence, legal, advisory and tax fees were charged as an exceptional cost in 2014 see note 1.
Costs of 3.1m associated with the placing of ordinary shares in respect of the acquisition were deducted from the share premium account.
Prior to acquisition, Moneybarn reported under UK GAAP.
A detailed conversion of Moneybarns financial statements to IFRS was completed post acquisition which reduced Moneybarns net assets on acquisition by approximately 11m, principally in respect of: i higher impairment provisions due to the impact of discounting future expected cash flows at the effective interest rate: and ii a change in policy in respect of thedeferral of the acquisition costs of new accounts.
The final fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Moneybarn as at the acquisition date were as follows: Book value on Fair value Recognised on acquisition adjustments acquisition m m m Intangible assets a 1.0 75.0 76.0 Property, plant and equipment 0.9 0.9 Deferred tax assets liabilities c 2.6 14.1 11.5 Amounts receivable from customers b 135.0 3.8 131.2 Cash and cash equivalents 5.2 5.2 Trade and other receivables 4.8 4.8 Trade and other payables c 5.2 1.0 6.2 Corporation tax liabilities 1.7 1.7 Bank and other borrowings d 144.9 5.0 149.9 Net identifiable liabilities assets acquired 2.3 51.1 48.8 Goodwill 71.2 Cash consideration 120.0 The fair value adjustments applied to Moneybarns net assets comprised: a 75.0m was attributed to the fair value of Moneybarns existing broker relationships which are an important influence on the revenuegenerating capacity of the business see note 12. b An adjustment to receivables of 3.8m was made to reflect the fair value of the receivables book at the acquisition date.
This adjustment principally related to the expected losses on those accounts which were not yet in arrears and therefore had not yet attracted an impairment provision under IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
Expected losses are currently only taken into account as part of the calculation of fair value on the acquisition of a receivables book in accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations.
Expected loss provisions have not been established on new Moneybarn accounts originated post acquisition, in line with both the groups accounting policies and IAS 39. c The tax effect of the other fair value adjustments of 14.1m together with 1.0m of additional potential liabilities which were not provided against at the acquisition date were made.
d The existing Moneybarn borrowings were refinanced shortly following acquisition, utilising the groups existing committed facilities at a substantially lower cost of funds.
The fair value of debt on acquisition was increased to include the break costs of 5.0m that were incurred in settling Moneybarns existing debt.
The goodwill of 71.2m represents the benefit of the groups lower cost funding and synergies available from the acquisition in respect of underwriting, collections and distribution channels see note 11.
In accordance with the groups accounting policies, goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for corporation tax purposes.
158 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Acquisition of Moneybarn continued An analysis of the fair value of the receivables acquired compared with the gross contractual amounts of the receivables book and the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected was as follows: Contractual Gross cash flows not contractual expected to be Fair value amounts collected m m m Amounts receivable from customers 131.2 225.0 24.7 The gross contractual amounts of receivables relates to the total contractual amount due from the customers over the life of the contract.
Cash flows not expected to be collected are the undiscounted cash flows not expected to be collected based on historical experience.
In 2014, Moneybarn generated revenue of 13.8m and a profit before tax, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items of 5.8m in the four months following acquisition.
In the eight months prior to acquisition, Moneybarn generated revenue of 24.2m and a profit before tax and exceptional costs of 4.6m.
Had the acquisition completed on the first day of the financial year and Moneybarn had benefited from the groups lower cost of funding in the first eight months of the year, the groups revenue would have been 24.2m higher at 1,099.9m and group profit before tax, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs would have been 9.2m higher at 243.6m.

The additions to investments in 2014 represented the gross consideration of 120.0m in respect of the acquisition of Moneybarn see note 10.
The disposal in 2014 of 0.4m represented the IFRIC 11 adjustment relating to share options awards provided to subsidiary employees.
Under IFRIC 11, the fair value of the options awards issued is required to be treated as a capital contribution and an investment in the relevant subsidiary, net of any share options award that have vested.
The adjustment in respect of IFRIC 11 in 2014 amounted to a net credit of 0.4m and was therefore treated as a disposal.
The adjustment for IFRIC 11 in 2015 amounted to nil.

162 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 15 Amounts receivable from customers On inception of a loan, receivables represent the amounts initially advanced to customers plus directly attributable issue costs.
Subsequently, receivables are increased by the revenue recognised and reduced by cash collections and any deduction for impairment.
Revenue is recognised on the net value of the receivable after deduction for impairment and not on the gross receivable prior to impairment.
Illustrative examples of revenue and impairment accounting in home credit can be found in the investor section of the companys website.
UK receivables grew by 14.5% in 2015 as a result of growth in UK customer numbers of 9.9% together with the success of the credit line increase programme to good-quality existing customers through the low and grow approach to lending.
The receivables in respect of the Polish pilot operation were derecognised on 1 April 2015 following the sale and transfer of the economic interest to a third party.
CCD receivables comprise 522.2m in respect of the Provident home credit business 2014: 582.5m, 12.1m in respect of Satsuma 2014: 5.0m and 10.8m in respect of glo 2014: 0.6m.
Home credit receivables showed a 10.4% reduction in 2015 reflecting the continued impact of significantly tighter credit standards which has restricted the recruitment of more marginal customers into the business.
The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 30% for Vanquis Bank 2014: 31%, 114% for CCD 2014: 112% and 28% for Moneybarn 2014: 29%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within CCD is 6.0 months 2014: 6.0 months and within Moneybarn is 37.0 months 2014: 32.0 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is currently the greater of 1.5% of the amount owed plus any fees and interest charges in the month and 5.
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 3.3 billion 2014: 2.9 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
The credit quality of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: 2015 2014 Vanquis Vanquis Credit quality of amounts receivable Bank CCD Moneybarn Group Bank CCD Moneybarn Group fromcustomers m m m m m m m m Neither past due nor impaired 1,168.4 279.9 192.6 1,640.9 1,022.0 258.4 119.2 1,399.6 Past due but not impaired 58.1 58.1 64.6 64.6 Impaired 83.6 207.1 27.0 317.7 87.4 265.1 32.5 385.0 Total 1,252.0 545.1 219.6 2,016.7 1,109.4 588.1 151.7 1,849.2 2015 2014 Vanquis Vanquis Credit quality of amounts receivable Bank CCD Moneybarn Group Bank CCD Moneybarn Group fromcustomers % % % % % % % % Neither past due nor impaired 93.3 51.3 87.7 81.4 92.1 43.9 78.6 75.7 Past due but not impaired 10.7 2.9 11.0 3.5 Impaired 6.7 38.0 12.3 15.7 7.9 45.1 21.4 20.8 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Past due but not impaired balances all relate to home credit loans within CCD.
There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank or Moneybarn which are past due but not impaired.
In home credit, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate materially.
The improved arrears profile in Vanquis Bank reflects the record low arrears currently being experienced by the business.
The improvement in the arrears profile of CCD reflectsthe significant improvement in the credit quality of the receivables book as a result of the tighter credit standards introduced in September 2013 and the benefit from the implementation of standardised arrears and collections processes.
The significant reduction in the proportion of impaired accounts within Moneybarn during 2015 reflects thesale of old, low value delinquent debtors to third party debt purchasers.

Using Vanquis Bank as an example, whilst interest revenue for customer statement balances is broadly calculated on the gross receivables balance of 1,477.0m subject to the normal suspension of interest where applicable and the timing of customer payments, interest revenue for IFRS purposes is calculated based on the net receivables balance of 1,252.0m, which is stated after the deduction of the impairment allowance account of 225.0m.
The non-standard customers served by the group are generally more likely to miss payments compared with more mainstream customers.
As the group recognises impairment events early after missing two weekly payments in the last 12 weeks in home credit and after missing one monthly payment in Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn the groups level of revenue on impaired loans is comparatively high.
The currency profile of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: Group 2015 2014 Currency profile of amounts receivable from customers m m Sterling 1,961.6 1,779.8 Euro 55.1 53.9 Zloty 15.5 Total group 2,016.7 1,849.2 Euro receivables represent loans issued by the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland, and amount to 10% of CCDs receivables 2014: 9%.
Zloty receivables relate tothe Vanquis Bank pilot credit card operation in Poland prior to the transfer of the economic interest to a third party on 1 April 2015.
Under IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, receivables are classed as Level 3 as they are not traded on an active market and the fair value istherefore determined through future cash flows.
16 Available for sale investment Group 2015 2014 Available for sale investment m m Fair value of shares in Visa Europe Limited 17.5 On 2 November 2015, Visa Inc. announced the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe Limited to create a single global payments business under the VISA brand.
Vanquis Bank is a member and shareholder of Visa Europe and in exchange for its one redeemable ordinary share previously held at par of 10 will receive upfront consideration in the form of cash approximately 14.7m and preferred stock approximately 10.1m on completion of the transaction.
The preferred stock is convertible into Class A common stock of Visa Inc, at a future date, subject to certain conditions.
In addition, Vanquis Bank may receive deferred cash consideration in 2020 which is contingent on certain performance thresholds being met by Visa Europe Limited.
Following the announcement of the proposed transaction, Vanquis Banks interest in Visa Europe has been valued at fair value which reflects the expected upfront cash proceeds and a number of factors and uncertainties relating to the other consideration.
The valuation of the preferred stock has been determined using the common stocks value as an approximation as both classes of stock have similar dividend rights.
However, adjustments are made for: i illiquidity, as the preferred stock is not tradeable on an open market and can only be transferred to other VISA principle members: and ii future litigation costs which could affect the valuation of the stock prior to conversion.
No valuation has been placed on the deferred element of the consideration due to its inherent uncertainty.
Accordingly, the 2015 balance sheet reflects an available for sale investment of 17.5m 2014: nil with the corresponding credit taken to equity.
Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2016.
Following completion, the gain taken through equity in 2015 will be recycled through the income statement as an exceptional gain in 2016.
Under IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, the investment is classified as Level 3 as the valuation is determined using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs.
As the cash valuation has been stated in the proposed sale documentation and the common stock share price is readily available, these inputs are deemed to be observable.
However, certain assumptions have been made in respect of the illiquidity adjustment to the share price and the likelihood of litigation costs in the future.
These inputs are therefore deemed to be unobservable.

Until August 2014, crosscurrency swaps were also held to fix the foreign exchange rate on the groups borrowings denominated in US dollars.
The cross currency swaps matured on repayment ofthe US dollar private placements.

a Hedging reserve movements The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be reflected in the balance sheet.
Generally, providing the derivative financial instruments meet certain accounting requirements, any movement in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates is deferred in the hedging reserve and does not impact the income statement.
The groups derivative financial instruments all currently meet these criteria.
If the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are higher than the current interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative liability is recognised.
Conversely, if the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are lower than the current floating interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative asset is recognised.
The movement in the hedging reserve within equity as a result of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments can be summarised as follows: Group Company 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m Interest rate swaps 3.9 2.3 3.9 2.3 2004 cross-currency swaps 0.2 Foreign exchange contracts 0.3 0.1 Net credit to the hedging reserve 3.6 2.2 3.9 2.3 Under IFRS 13, Fair value Measurement, all derivative financial instruments are classed as Level 2 as they are not traded in an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through discounting future cash flows, using appropriate market rates and yield curves.
b Income statement There was no impact on the income statement of the group and the company in the year in respect of the movement in the fair value ofineffective interest rate swaps, previously designated as cash flow hedges 2014: nil.
168 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Derivative financial instruments continued c Interest rate swaps The group and company use interest rate swaps in order to manage the interest rate risk on the groups borrowings.
The group has entered into various interest rate swaps which were designated and effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and company 2015 2014 m m Liability at 1 January 4.4 6.7 Credited to the hedging reserve 3.9 2.3 Liability at 31 December 0.5 4.4 The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the group and company were as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average Range of average average Range of average interest interest period to interest interest period to rate rates maturity rate rates maturity Group and company % % years % % years Sterling 3.2 3.13.3 0.4 3.2 3.13.3 1.4 d Cross-currency swaps The group and company used cross-currency swaps in order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising on the groups US private placement loan notes issued in 2003 and 2004.
All of the cross-currency swaps have now matured, in line with the maturity and repayment of the underlying borrowing.
2004 private placement loan notes The group put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the 2004 US dollar private placement loan notes into floating rate sterling-denominated interest liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps matched the underlying loan notes which were repaid on 14 August 2014.
The swaps were designated as cash flow and fair value hedges.
The cash flow hedge portion of the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39 until maturity.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes were deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss on thefairvalue hedge in the year.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2015 2014 m m Asset at 1 January 5.4 Exchange rate movement 5.2 Charged to the hedging reserve 0.2 Asset at 31 December e Foreign exchange contracts The group uses foreign exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk arising from CCDs euro operations in the Republic of Ireland and Vanquis Banks branch in Poland up until its closure during 2015.
A liability of 0.1m is held in the group balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 in respect of foreign exchange contracts 2014: asset of 0.2m.
The groups foreign exchange contracts comprise forward foreign exchange contracts to buy sterling and sell euros for a total notional amount of 9.0m 2014: 6.5m.
These contracts have a range of maturity dates from 18 January 2016 to 13 December 2016 2014: 20 January 2015 to 20 October 2015.
These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
Accordingly, the movement in fair value of 0.3m has been charged to the hedging reserve within equity 2014: credit of 0.1m.

There is no collateral held in respect of trade and other receivables 2014: nil.
20 Retirement benefit asset a Pension schemes defined benefit The retirement benefit asset reflects the difference between the present value of the groups obligation to current and past employees to provide a defined benefit pension and the fair value of assets held to meet that obligation.
As at 31 December 2015, the fair value of the assets exceeded the obligation and hence a net pension asset has been recorded.
The groups defined benefit pension scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
The group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
The scheme covers 16% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type.
All future benefits in the scheme are now provided on a cash balance basis, with a defined amount being made available at retirement, based on a percentage of salary that is revalued up to retirement with reference to increases in price inflation.
This retirement account is then used to purchase an annuity on the open market.
The scheme also provides pension benefits that were accrued in the past on a final salary basis, but which are no longer linked to final salary.
The scheme also provides death benefits.
The scheme is a UK registered pension scheme under UK legislation and is not contracted-out of the Second State Pension.
The scheme is governed by a Trust Deed and Rules, with trustees responsible for the operation and the governance of the scheme.
The Trustees work closely with the group on funding and investment strategy decisions.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 June 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits, has been based on results of the 2015 valuation, updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.
The group is entitled to a refund of any surplus, subject to tax, if the scheme winds up after all benefits have been paid.
170 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Retirement benefit asset continued The group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are as follows: Investment risk the liabilities for IAS 19 purposes are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the assets underperform this yield a deficit will arise.
The scheme has a long-term objective to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that better match liabilities.
Change in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the liabilities, although this will be partly offset by an increase in matching assets.
Inflation risk part of the liabilities are linked to inflation.
If inflation increases then liabilities will increase, although this will be partly offset byan increase in assets.
As part of a long-term fide-risking strategy, the scheme has increased its portfolio in inflation matched assets.
Life expectancies the schemes final salary benefits provide pensions for the rest of members lives and for their spouses lives.
If members live longer than assumed, then the liabilities in respect of final salary benefits increase.
The net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet of the group and company is as follows: Group and company 2015 2014 m % m % Equities 74.7 11 249.2 36 Other diversified return seeking investments 67.5 10 65.5 9 Corporate bonds 133.0 20 137.8 20 Fixed interest gilts 208.3 31 80.6 11 Index-linked gilts 181.7 28 164.9 24 Cash and money market funds 1.2 2.1 Total fair value of scheme assets 666.4 100 700.1 100 Present value of funded defined benefit obligation 604.1 644.1 Net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 62.3 56.0 As part of a fide-risking strategy agreed between the company and the pension trustees to hedge the inflation and interest rate risks associated with the liabilities of the pension scheme, a substantial amount of more volatile growth funds equities were reinvested in liability protection assets fixed interest and index-linked gilts in January 2015.
The valuation of the pension scheme has increased from 56.0m at 31 December 2014 to 62.3m at 31 December 2015.

The net charge credit recognised in the income statement of the group and company has been included within administrative costs.
Movements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows: Group Company 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at 1 January 700.1 613.8 700.1 613.8 Interest on scheme assets 25.7 26.9 25.7 26.9 Contributions by subsidiaries 11.6 12.4 Actuarial movement on scheme assets 52.4 77.9 52.4 77.9 Contributions by the group company 12.2 13.1 0.6 0.7 Net benefits paid out 19.2 31.6 19.2 31.6 Fair value of scheme assets at 31 December 666.4 700.1 666.4 700.1 The group contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 31 December 2016 are expected to be approximately 11m.
Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows: Group and company 2015 2014 m m Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 1 January 644.1 584.6 Current service cost 5.0 5.8 Interest on scheme liabilities 23.5 25.5 Exceptional curtailment credit 2.6 0.6 Actuarial movement on scheme liabilities 46.7 60.4 Net benefits paid out 19.2 31.6 Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 604.1 644.1 The liabilities of the scheme are based on the current value of expected benefit payments over the next 90 years.
The weighted average duration of the scheme is approximately 18 years.
The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: Group and company 2015 2014 % % Price inflation RPI 3.00 3.10 Price inflation CPI 2.00 2.10 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.80 2.90 Inflationary increases to pensions in deferment 2.00 2.10 Discount rate 3.75 3.70 The pension increase assumption shown above applies to pensions increasing in payment each year in line with RPI up to 5%.
Pensions accrued prior to 2000 are substantially subject to fixed 5% increases each year.
In deferment increases prior to retirement are linked to CPI.
The mortality assumptions are based on the self-administered pension scheme SAPS series 1 tables, with multipliers of 105% and 115% respectively for males and females.
The 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females reflects the lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes, which was concluded following a study of the schemes membership.
Future improvements in mortality are based on the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI 2015 model with along-term improvement trend of 1.25% per annum.
Under these mortality assumptions, the life expectancies of members are as follows: Male Female 2015 2014 2015 2014 Group and company years years years years Current pensioner aged 65 21.7 22.0 23.3 23.5 Current member aged 45 from age 65 23.4 23.7 25.1 25.4 172 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Retirement benefit asset continued The table below shows the sensitivity on the defined benefit obligation not including any impact on assets of changes in the key assumptions.
Depending on the scenario, there would also be compensating asset movements.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group and company.
The pension charge in the consolidated income statement represents contributions paid by the group in respect of the plan and amounted to 5.5m for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: 4.5m.
Contributions made by the company amounted to 0.4m 2014: 0.4m.

Financial statements 173 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 21 Deferred tax Deferred tax is a future tax liability or asset resulting from temporary differences or timing differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.
Deferred tax arises primarily in respect of derivative financial instruments, the groups pension asset, deductions for employee share awards which are recognised differently for tax purposes, property, plant and equipment which is depreciated on a different basis for tax purposes, certain cost provisions for which tax deductions are only available when the costs are paid and available for sale assets which are taxed only on disposal.
The deferred tax liability recognised on the acquisition of Moneybarn relates primarily to the intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships which will be amortised in future periods but for which tax deductions will not be available.
This is presented net of deferred tax assets in respect of the transitional adjustments arising in Moneybarn on adoption of IFRS, tax relief for which is available in post acquisition periods.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method.
During 2015, further reductions in corporation tax rates were enacted, reducing the corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
As the temporary differences on which deferred tax is calculated as at 31 December 2015 are expected to largely reverse after 1 April 2020 2014: 1 April 2015, deferred tax at 31 December 2015 has been re-measured at 18% 2014: 20% and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream corporation tax and bank surcharge rate of 26% 2014: 20%.
In 2015, movements in the deferred tax balances have been measured at the mainstream corporation tax rate for the year of 20.25% 2014: 21.5%.
Atax credit in 2015 of 2.4m 2014: credit of 1.3m represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of these changes and an additional deferred tax charge of 0.2m 2014: credit of 0.3m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in respect of items previously reflected directly in other comprehensive income.
The movement in the deferred tax balance during the year can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2015 2014 2015 2014 Liability asset m m m m At 1 January 13.6 3.5 8.2 2.8 Charge to the income statement note 5 0.2 3.0 1.9 1.5 Acquisition of Moneybarn note 10 11.5 Charge credit on other comprehensive income prior to impact of change in UK tax rate note5 3.3 4.2 0.4 4.3 Impact of change in UK tax rate: credit to the income statement 2.4 1.3 0.1 charge credit to other comprehensive income 0.2 0.3 0.9 0.3 At 31 December 14.9 13.6 8.8 8.2 An analysis of the deferred tax liability for the group is set out below: 2015 2014 Accelerated Other Retirement Accelerated Other Retirement capital temporary benefit capital temporary benefit allowances differences obligations Total allowances differences obligations Total Group liability asset m m m m m m m m At 1 January 2.0 4.7 10.9 13.6 1.7 7.6 5.8 3.5 Credit charge to the income statement 0.5 1.7 2.4 0.2 0.3 1.6 1.7 3.0 Acquisition of Moneybarn note 10 11.5 11.5 Charge credit on other comprehensive income prior to change in UK tax rate 4.5 1.2 3.3 0.4 3.8 4.2 Impact of change in UK tax rate: charge credit to the income statement 0.1 2.3 0.2 2.4 1.2 0.1 1.3 charge credit to other comprehensive income 1.1 0.9 0.2 0.3 0.3 At 31 December 2.4 6.3 11.0 14.9 2.0 4.7 10.9 13.6 174 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Deferred tax continued An analysis of the deferred tax liability for the company is set out below: 2015 2014 Accelerated Other Retirement Accelerated Other Retirement capital temporary benefit capital temporary benefit allowances differences obligations Total allowances differences obligations Total Company liability asset m m m m m m m m At 1 January 0.3 3.0 10.9 8.2 0.4 3.4 5.8 2.8 Credit charge to the income statement 0.1 0.4 2.4 1.9 0.1 0.1 1.7 1.5 Charge credit on other comprehensive income prior to impact of change in UK tax rate 0.8 1.2 0.4 0.5 3.8 4.3 Impact of change in UK tax rate: charge credit to the income statement 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 credit to other comprehensive income 0.9 0.9 0.3 0.3 At 31 December 0.2 2.4 11.0 8.8 0.3 3.0 10.9 8.2 Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all temporary differences because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
22 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, floats held by agents within CCD and Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources, held in accordance with the PRAs liquidity regime.
The PRA requires regulated entities to maintain a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources to ensure they have available funds to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The amount of the liquid assets buffer is calculated using Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG set by the PRA based on the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP prepared by Vanquis Bank.
In addition, further liquid resources must be maintained based upon daily stress tests linked to three key liquidity risks of Vanquis Bank, namely retail deposits maturities, undrawn credit card lines and operating cash flows.
This results in a dynamic liquid resources requirement, largely driven by retail deposits maturities in the following three months.
Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources, amounts to 134.2m at 31 December 2015 2014: 121.4m and is held in a combination of UK government gilts of 20.7m 2014: 65.7m and a Bank of England reserves account of 113.5m 2014: 55.7m.

g Retail deposits Vanquis Bank is a PRA regulated bank and commenced taking retail deposits in July 2011.
As at 31 December 2015, 731.0m 2014: 580.3m of fixed-rate, fixed-term retail deposits of one, two, three, four and five years had been taken.
The deposits in issue at 31 December 2015 have been issued at rates of between 1.51% and 3.02%.
A reconciliation of the movement in retail deposits is set out below: 2015 2014 Group m m At 1 January 580.3 435.1 New funds received 225.7 190.7 Maturities 121.6 69.7 Retentions 58.5 26.6 Cancellations 19.4 8.9 Capitalised interest 7.5 6.5 At 31 December 731.0 580.3 h Subordinated loan notes On 15 June 2005, the company issued 100.0m of subordinated loan notes repayable on 15 June 2015.
94.0m of the liability was settled in 2009 and the remaining 6.0m was settled on maturity.
The rights of repayment to holders of the loan notes were subordinated to all other borrowings and liabilities of the company upon a winding up of the company and, in certain circumstances, upon its administration.
i Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The group therefore maintains headroom on its committed borrowing facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months, after assuming that Vanquis Bank will fully fund itself through retail deposits and repay its intercompany loan to Provident Financial plc.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December were as follows: Group and company 2015 2014 m m Expiring within one year Expiring within one to two years Expiring in more than two years 222.3 111.5 Total group and company 222.3 111.5 The table above excludes the additional capacity for Vanquis Bank to take retail deposits up to the value of the intercompany loan from Provident Financial plc of 283.0m as at 31 December 2015.
Accordingly, Vanquis Banks retail deposits capacity at 31 December 2015 amounts to 283.0m.
The groups total funding capacity at the end of 2015 therefore amounts to 505.3m, being the groups headroom on undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 222.3m plus the amount of Vanquis Banks intercompany loan of283.0m.

180 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Share-based payments The group issues share options and awards to employees as part of its employee remuneration packages.
The group operates three equity settled share schemes: the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, employees savings-related share option schemes typically referred to as Save As You Earn schemes SAYE, and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
In 2015 the group introduced a cash-settled share incentive scheme, the Provident Financial Equity Plan PFEP for eligible employees based on a percentage of salary.
The group also previously operated senior executive share option schemes ESOS SESO, although no options have been granted under these schemes since 2006.
When an equity settled share option or award is granted, a fair value is calculated based on the share price at grant date, probability of the option award vesting, the groups recent share price volatility, and the risk associated with the option award.
A fair value is calculated based on the value of awards granted and adjusted at each balance sheet date for the probability of vesting against performance conditions.
The fair value of all options awards are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option award.
During 2015, awards options have been granted under the LTIS, PSP, SAYE and PFEP schemes 2014: awards options granted under the LTIS, PSP and SAYE schemes.
The increase in the equity-settled share-based payment charge from 8.7m in 2014 to 10.5m in 2015, principally reflects higher expected levels of vesting of LTIS schemes based on the groups current performance.
a Equity-settled schemes The charge to the income statement in 2015 for equity settled schemes was 10.5m for the group 2014: 8.7m and 5.3m for the company 2014: 4.6m.
Theexpected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK Government bondsofasimilar duration to the life of the share option.
