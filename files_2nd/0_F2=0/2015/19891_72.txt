DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING CONTINUED MASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS A number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting agreements.
In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other.
In certain circumstances such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet.
This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default.
The column Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet Financial instruments shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.

INVESTMENT AND RETURN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments.
To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must: be readily convertible into cash: have an insignificant risk of changes in value: and have a maturity period of three months or less at acquisition.
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are first recognised on the trade date.
At that point, they are classified as: held-to-maturity investments: loans and receivables: available-for-sale financial assets: or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

INVESTMENT AND RETURN CONTINUED I HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS These are assets with set cash flows and fixed maturities which Unilever intends to hold to maturity.
They are held at cost plus interest using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
II LOANS AND RECEIVABLES These are assets with an established payment profile and which are not listed on a recognised stock exchange.
They are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards, loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any impairment.
III AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Any financial assets not classified as either loans and receivables or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are designated as available-for-sale.
They are initially recognised at fair value, usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards, they are measured at fair value with changes being recognised in equity.
When the investment is sold or impaired, the accumulated gains and losses are moved from equity to the income statement.
Interest and dividends from these assets are recognised in the income statement.
IV FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS These are derivatives and assets that are held for trading.
Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS Each year, the Group assesses whether there is evidence that financial assets are impaired.
A significant or prolonged fall in value below the cost of an asset generally indicates that an asset may be impaired.
If impaired, financial assets are written down to their estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses on assets classified as loans and receivables are recognised in profit and loss.
When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in profit and loss.
Impairment losses on assets classified as available-for-sale are recognised by moving the loss accumulated in equity to the income statement.
Any subsequent recovery in value of an available-for-sale debt security is recognised within profit and loss.
However, any subsequent recovery in value of an equity security is recognised within equity, and is recorded at amortised cost.
