Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board IASB.
IFRSs that are mandatory for application as of 31 December 2015, but not adopted by the European Union, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors believe there are no material uncertainties which could create a significant doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future.
Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation and functional currency of the Company is the US dollar.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in US dollars at the rate on the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are initially recorded at acquisition cost.
Writedowns are recorded if, in the opinion of the management, there is any impairment in value.
The initial cost of the investment in Evraz Group S. A. was measured at the carrying amount of the equity items of Evraz Group S. A. as a separate legal entity at the date of the reorganisation Note 3. Dividend income is recognised as revenue when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date when the investment is delivered to or by the Company.
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 245 Financial Statements 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Investments continued Investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, are classified as available-for-sale: these are included in non-current assets unless management has the express intention of holding the investment for less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period or unless they will need to be sold to raise operating capital, in which case they are included in current assets.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the statement of operations.
Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments are not recognised in the statement of operations.
Impairment losses in respect of debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the statement of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Financial Guarantee Liabilities Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts between the Company and banks providing loans to the Companys subsidiaries are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, being equal to the estimated future cash inflows receivable from the subsidiaries under the guarantee agreements, with a corresponding recognition of the same amount as receivables from related parties.
Subsequently, the liability is amortised over the lives of the guarantees through the statement of comprehensive income, unless it is considered probable that a guarantee will be called, in which case it is measured at the value of the guaranteed amount payable, if higher.

At 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Company assessed the recoverability of its investment in EGD.
The recoverable amount of the asset was based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on the business plans approved by management and an appropriate discount rate reflecting time value of money and risks associated with the asset.
The discount rates were 13.90% and 18.36% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
As a result, in 2015, the Company recognised an impairment loss of $163 million.
The major driver that led to impairment was the change in expectations of long-term prices for coal.
In 2014, the Company reversed $120 million of impairment losses previously recognised due to the increased estimation of the value in use of the subsidiary as a result of the improved technological methods of development of the project and better quality of coal than that originally estimated.
Corber Enterprises S. r. l. In 2013, EVRAZ plc acquired a 50% ownership interest in Corber Enterprises S. r. l. Corber, the parent of a coal mining company Raspadskaya, for $964 million.

As a result, in 2014 the Company recognised an impairment loss of $543 million, which was all recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and transferred out of the merger reserve.

OJSC Mining and Metallurgical Company Timir Since 2013 the Company owns a 51% ownership interest in the joint venture with Alrosa for the development of iron ore deposits in the Yakutia region in Russia.
The Companys consideration for this stake of 4,950 million roubles was recognised in the amount of $149 million being the present value of the expected cash outflows at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction.
The payment schedule was subsequently amended and in 2015 and 2014 the Company recognised $3 million and $5 million, respectively, within interest expense representing the unwinding of the discount on this liability and interest charges on the postponed instalments.
In 2014, the Company paid 990 million roubles $28 million of purchase consideration and $1 million of interest charges.
In 2015, only interest charges were paid.

The discount rates were 12.70% and 14.46% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
As a result, in 2015 and 2014, the Company recognised impairment losses of $52 million and $47 million, respectively.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the decrease in the expected long-term prices for iron ore, the increase in the amount of the required capital expenditures to maintain the production at the budgeted capacities and the postponement of the start of production for 1 year.
Additional information regarding Timir is provided in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.
Any change to the key assumptions in the value in use calculations could materially impact the recoverable value and result in further impairment or a reversal of previously recognised impairment.
