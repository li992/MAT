NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Poundland Group plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Company was incorporated on 24 January 2014.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies, that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next period are discussed in note 30.
1.1 Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRSs require an alternative treatment.
The principal variations relate to financial instruments.
1.2 Going concern The Group financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group has sufficient financial resources, together with a strong ongoing trading performance.
On 17 March 2014, the Group entered into a new revolving credit and working capital facility of 55 million with a syndicate of banks.
The former and new borrowing facilities contain financial covenants which have been met throughout both periods.
The Groups forecasts and projections show that the new facility provides adequate headroom for its current and future anticipated cash requirements.
1.3 Basis of consolidation On 17 March 2014, the Company obtained control of the entire share capital of Poundland Group Holdings Limited via a share for share exchange.
There were no changes in rights or proportion of control exercised as a result of this transaction.
Although the share for share exchange resulted in a change of legal ownership, in substance these financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing group, headed by Poundland Group Holdings Limited.
Both the current and the prior period statement of financial position reflect the share capital structure of Poundland Group plc and the merger reserve arising as a result of the share for share exchange transaction.
The prior period consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 69 explains the impact of the share for share exchange in more detail.
The income statement presented for the prior period includes the results prior to 17 March 2014 when the group was headed by Poundland Group Holdings Limited.
For details of the impact on earnings per share, see 1.20.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
com 71 FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.4 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Group at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the consolidated income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, except for differences arising on qualifying cash flow hedges which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rate ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
1.5 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
1.6 Financial Instruments Financial Assets The Groups financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in administrative expenses.
ii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts in addition to the definition above.
POUNDLAND GROUP Plc 72 Annual report and financial statements for p e 29 March 2015 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.6 Financial Instruments continued Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
i Bank borrowings Term loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of cashflow hedges.
ii Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
iii Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments comprising foreign currency forward contracts and commodity hedges are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase of overseas sourced products, interest rates and fuel price fluctuations.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Group uses the derivatives to hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the statement of changes in equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any element of the remeasurement of the derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement within financial income or financial expenses.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve months, or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months from the reporting date.
com 73 FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.7 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, and net of capital contributions received.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Short leasehold property less than 50 years over the term of the lease Fixtures and equipment 3-25 years dependent upon length of lease Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.
1.8 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Costs relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
1.9 Intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Brand 20 years Trademarks 5 years Software 3 years 1.10 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
POUNDLAND GROUP Plc 74 Annual report and financial statements for p e 29 March 2015 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.11 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets Financial assets including receivables A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event has a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets the cash-generating unit.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, CGU.
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.12 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
com 75 FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.12 Employee benefits continued Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payment transactions The Group operates a number of equity settled share based compensation plans.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non market performance conditions at the vesting date, measured at the grant date fair value of the award.
At each reporting date, the group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives which are expected to vest.
The impact of the revision of original estimates is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
1.13 Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
1.14 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of goods sold to external customers, net of value added tax and promotional discounts.
Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the customer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
1.15 Supplier Income Rebate income Rebate income consists of income generated from volume related rebate agreements and other supplier funding received on an ad hoc basis for in store promotional activity.
The income received is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales.
Volume related income is recognised based on the expected entitlement at the reporting date based on agreed and documented contractual terms.
Where the contractual period is not yet complete, the Group will estimate expected purchase volumes taking into account current performance levels to assess the probability of achieving contractual target volumes.
Other supplier funding is recognised as invoiced to the suppliers, subject to satisfaction of any related performance conditions.
To minimise the risk arising from estimation, supplier confirmations are obtained at the reporting date prior to amounts being invoiced.
Promotional funding Promotional pricing income relates to income received from suppliers to invest in the customer offer.
It is considered an adjustment to the core cost price of a product and as such is recognised as reduction in the purchase price of a product.
Timing of invoicing of amounts due is agreed on an individual basis with each supplier.
Uncollected commercial income at the reporting date is presented within the financial statements as follows Trade payables it is common practice for the Group to net income due from suppliers against amounts owing to that supplier.
Any outstanding invoiced commercial income relating to these suppliers at the reporting date will be included within trade payables.
Trade receivables where there is no practice of netting commercial income from amounts owed to the supplier, the Group will present amounts due within trade receivables.
Where commercial income is earned but not invoiced to the supplier at the reporting date, the amount due is included within prepayments and accrued income.
POUNDLAND GROUP Plc 76 Annual report and financial statements for p e 29 March 2015 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.16 Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense i. e. on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
1.17 Financial income and expenses Financial expenses comprise interest payable and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges that are recognised in the income statement.
Financial income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
1.18 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement and statement of other comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
1.19 Non underlying items Non underlying items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence.
The Directors consider that these items should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
1.20 Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
As explained in the basis of consolidation accounting policy, the Groups financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing group headed by Poundland Group Holdings Limited.
That company had preference shares, the holders of which were entitled to a cumulative dividend at the discretion of the Directors.
In accordance with IAS 33, for the comparative period, the accrued preference share dividend has been deducted from profit for the period to compute the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders.
The conversion factor applied in the share reorganisation has been applied to calculate the number of ordinary shares of Poundland Group Holdings Limited used to compute the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the comparative period.
In this way the impact of the preference shares has been excluded from both earnings and the weighted average number of shares.
As a precursor to the share for share exchange, the preference shares in Poundland Group Holdings Limited were converted to ordinary shares and any entitlement to a dividend on these shares was forfeited.
For the periods reported, the Group has chosen to present an adjusted EPS calculation to aid comparability and to provide a consistent measure of performance, by excluding the impact of the preference shares from both earnings and the weighted average number of shares.
For this adjusted measure, in both reported periods, the weighted average number of shares is based on the share capital structure of Poundland Group plc and assumes that this structure was in place from 1 April 2013 i. e. the beginning of the prior period.
For both EPS measures statutory and adjusted, the Group has also presented an alternative version with profit adjusted for non underlying items.
A reconciliation of the adjusted and alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 3. www.
com 77 FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.21 Adopted IFRS not yet applied Amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS have been endorsed by the EU but not yet adopted.
None of these amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
1.22 Reserves Cash flow reserve The cash flow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of cash flow hedges where the contract has not yet expired.
The reserve is stated net of the associated tax.
On expiry of the contract, the effective portion is recycled to the income statement.
Translation reserve The translation reserve represents the cumulative translation differences for foreign operations.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arises on consolidation as a result of the share for share exchange on 17 March 2014.
It represents the difference between the nominal value of shares issued by Poundland Group plc in this transaction and the share capital and reserves of Poundland Group Holdings Limited.
2 Operating segment The Group has one reportable segment, discount retailing of a variety of products.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM is the Board of Directors.
Internal management reports are reviewed by the CODM on a monthly basis.
Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and EBITDA.
Management believes that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and all material non-current assets are located in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individually small value transactions and, as a result, Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.
All revenue is generated from external customers.

POUNDLAND GROUP Plc 80 Annual report and financial statements for p e 29 March 2015 5 Reconciliation of adjusted profit measure EBITDA The Directors consider EBITDA to be a more consistent measure of operating performance.
Operating profit is adjusted to exclude the impact of finance costs, taxation, amortisation and depreciation.
Underlying EBITDA excludes the impact of those distribution costs and administrative expenses which do not contribute to current trading activities.
The Directors consider that this measure more fairly reflects actual operating performance.

com 87 FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing Goodwill of 163.9 million arising on the acquisition of Poundland Holdings Limited in June 2010 is allocated to the Groups one reportable segment.
For impairment testing purposes, goodwill has been allocated to a group of cash generating units CGUs comprising the Groups one operating segment.
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for impairment on the basis of value in use calculations using discounted cash flows.
As the value in use exceeded the carrying value for the cash generating units, no impairment loss was recognised in the period.
In assessing the value in use, the four year business plan was used to provide cash flow projections to the period ended March 2019.
The cash flow projections are subject to key assumptions in respect of discount rates, achievement of future revenue and EBITDA growth.
The Directors have reviewed and approved the assumptions inherent in the model as part of the annual budget process using historic experience and considering economic and business risks facing the Group.
In assessing the Groups value in use a pre-tax discount rate of 12.1% 2014: 13.7% has been applied to the group of CGUs.
The calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude there was no impairment.

23 Share based payments The Group operates four share award plans, all of which are equity settled.
The Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was adopted by the directors on 27 February 2014.
All colleagues of the Group are eligible to participate in the PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The first issue of awards was made on 17 March 2014.
All awards were granted for nil consideration.
Further awards were made on 4 July 2014.
A summary of the rules for this scheme and the related performance conditions are set out in the Directors Remuneration report.
The Restricted Stock Plan RSP The RSP was adopted by the Directors on 27 February 2014.
Awards over ordinary shares are granted subject only to continued employment.
There are no performance conditions attached to the award.
All colleagues of the Group other than Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee are eligible to participate in the RSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Initial RSP awards were made on 17 March 2014 with further awards being made on 4 July 2014.
Other than these awards, the intention is that RSP awards will only be made in special or unusual circumstances.
The RSP awards will usually vest three years after the date of grant.
Vested share awards will be released to participants automatically within 30 days of the vesting date.
POUNDLAND GROUP Plc 94 Annual report and financial statements for p e 29 March 2015 23 Share based payments continued The Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP was adopted by the directors on 27 February 2014.
Under the CSOP, the Directors may grant to eligible colleagues options to acquire Ordinary Shares at an exercise price which may not be less than the market value of an Ordinary Share on the date of grant.
All colleagues of the Group are eligible to participate in the CSOP at the discretion of the Directors.
The CSOP options may be subject to performance conditions.
However, the initial award made on 18 March 2014 together with awards made on 4 July 2014, did not have any related performance conditions.
A CSOP option will normally only be exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of grant and when all conditions applying to it have been satisfied.
No dividends are paid on shares awarded.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share based payment awards are as follows: For the period ended 29 March 2015 PSP RSP CSOP Weighted Weighted Weighted average Number of average Number of average Number of exercise Options exercise Options exercise Options price 000 price 000 price 000 Outstanding at 30 March 2014 1,248 293 3.75 946 Granted during the period 32 3 3.42 60 Outstanding at 29 March 2015 1,280 296 3.73 1,006 The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
The PSP and RSP awards are valued at 100% of the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of CSOP awards granted during the period is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
Measurements inputs and assumptions are as follows: 29 March 30 March 2015 2014 Share price at grant date 3.38 3.75 Fair value at grant date 81.97p 92.48p Exercise price 3.42 3.75 Expected volatility 31.7% 32.5% Option life years 10 10 Expected life years 4 4 Expected dividend yield 1.08% 1.09% Risk-free interest rate based on national government bonds 1.6% 1.3% As the Company has recently listed, there is a restricted history of share price movements.
The expected volatility is therefore a proxy volatility figure, which has been derived as the average volatility of FTSE 250 companies within the General Retailers sector over the four years prior to grant date i. e. the period equivalent to the expected term.
The risk free rate is equivalent to the prevailing UK Gilts rate at grant date, which is commensurate with the expected term.
CSOP awards are granted under a service condition.
This is not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.
The share based payments expense has been calculated using recent colleague turnover levels.

This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established during the period and adopted by the directors on 27 February 2014.
Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Group at a stated exercise price.
Under restricted circumstances colleagues leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
At 29 March 2015, colleagues held 1,207 three-year savings contracts with options over 1.3 million shares.

Details of options at 29 March 2015 are set out below: Date of grant Date of expiry Exercise price Options outstanding 5 September 2014 1 November 2017 2.50 1,297 Options granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 29 March 2015 Share price at grant date 3.24 Fair value at grant date 102.7p Exercise price 2.50 Expected volatility 30.1% Option life years 3.4 Expected dividend yield 1.13% Risk-free interest rate based on national government bands 1.3% As the Company has recently listed, there is a restricted history of share price movements.
The expected volatility is therefore a proxy volatility figure, which has been derived as the average volatility of FTSE 250 companies within the General Retailers sector over the three years prior to grant date i. e. the period equivalent to the expected term.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years on the assumption that, dependent upon the grade of the colleague, between 5 and 15 per cent of options will be cancelled over the service period as colleagues leave the SAYE scheme.

A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business has been developed.
A register of strategic and operational risk is maintained and reviewed by the Directors, who also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation.
This risk arises from the Groups foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity hedging agreements with its banking counterparties.
The Group only deals with credit with Banks in the Banking Syndicate or with Banks who are creditworthy, and monitors the creditworthiness of these counterparties using publicly available information.
As the principal business of the Group is cash sales, the Group trade receivables are small.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk and any associated impairments are immaterial.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties, who are either party to the Groups Banking syndicate, or who are creditworthy counterparties with a minimum of A-3 short-term credit rating.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The risk is measured by review of forecast liquidity each month to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements and by monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no expected significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Cash flow forecasts are submitted monthly to the Directors.
These continue to demonstrate the strong cash generating ability of the business and its ability to operate within existing agreed banking facilities.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
The Group has a 55.0 million Revolving Credit and Working Capital facility to support short and medium term liquidity.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest and currency risk, although the Group does hedge fuel used by its fleet of vehicles in the distribution of product to stores.
com 97 FINANCIALS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Interest rate risk The Groups revolving credit facility incurs variable interest rate charges linked to LIBOR plus a margin dependent on the Groups net debt ratio.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants and Business Plan.
The Group currently has no interest rate hedge in place.
The Group continues to monitor the interest rate swap market and future cash flows to decide on the appropriateness of any future interest rate hedges.
Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the trade being in US dollars.
In addition to this, the Group is exposed to transaction risk on the translation of surplus Euro balances, generated by the Republic of Ireland branch, and to a lesser extent, its Spanish subsidiary, into sterling.
The Groups policy allows these exposures to be hedged for up to 18 months forward in order to fix the cost in sterling.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
The carrying amount of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows: 29 March 2015 30 March 2014 USD Euro USD Euro 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 189 1,507 1,301 2,898 Trade and other payables 44 3,469 1,617 3,027 233 1,962 2,918 129 Pension liability risk The Group has no association with any defined benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect of such a scheme.
The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for its colleagues.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to optimise returns to its Shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence and to sustain future growth.
The Directors regularly monitor the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.

At the end of each reporting period, the effect of hypothetical changes in interest and currency rates are as follows: Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on floating rate borrowings i. e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates if interest rates were to change by - 1%.
The impact on the results in the income statement and statement of other comprehensive income and equity would be: 29 March 2015 30 March 2014 Increase decrease Increase decrease in equity in equity 000 000 1 % movement in interest rates 139 47 -1 % movement in interest rates 139 47 Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates for its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups derivatives are denominated: 29 March 2015 30 March 2014 Increase decrease Increase decrease in equity in equity 000 000 10% appreciation of the US dollar 11,898 13,257 10% depreciation of the US dollar 9,733 10,847 A strengthening weakening of sterling, as indicated, against the US dollar at the reporting date would have increased decreased the cash flow hedge reserve and retained earnings by the amounts shown above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
There are no material movements in the income statement for the period.
The movement in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future inventory purchases.

com 103 FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods impacted.
The key judgements and estimates employed in the financial statements are considered below.
Allowances against the carrying amount of inventories The Group provides against the carrying amount of inventories for inventory lines based on expected demand for its products to ensure that inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Judgement is required in respect of assessing future demand and promotional offers.
Impairment of goodwill On an annual basis, the Group is required to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is less than its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance.
Details of assumptions used in the impairment of goodwill are detailed in note 13.
Provisions Provisions are made using the Directors best estimates of future cash flows based on the current level of information available to them.
Actual cash flows will be dependent on future events.
For details of assumptions see note 21.
Depreciation and amortisation Judgement is required in assessing the useful economic lives of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets.
These assumptions are based on the Directors best estimate of the life of the asset and its residual value at the end of its economic life.
Valuation of other intangible assets The assessment of fair value in a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities in the acquired business.
The key judgements required are the identification of intangible assets meeting the recognition criteria of IAS 38 and their attributable fair values.
The key assumptions in relation to the brand valuation are the Directors best estimate of its life and the royalty and discount rate used in its valuation.
Deferred taxation The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon future taxable income and the expected recoverability of the balance.
The estimate will include assumptions regarding future income streams of the Group and the future movement in corporation tax rates in the respective jurisdictions.
