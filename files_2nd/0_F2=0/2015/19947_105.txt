Share-based payments Accounting policies The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Companys equity instruments.
The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based compensation plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the Companys subsidiaries over the vesting period.
The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments.
The Company currently uses a number of equity settled share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors and employees of its subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2015, the Company had 25 million ordinary share options outstanding 2014: 27 million and no ADS options outstanding 2014:nil.
The Company has made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments.
At 31 March 2015, the cumulative capital contribution net of payments received from subsidiaries was 93 million 2014: 131 million.
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the total capital contribution arising from share-based payments was 88 million 2014: 103 million, with payments of 126 million 2014: 177 million received from subsidiaries.

2 Own shares relate to treasury shares which are purchased out of distributable profits and therefore reduce reserves available for distribution.
3 The Company has determined what is realised and unrealised in accordance with the guidance provided by ICAEW TECH 2 10 and the requirements of UK law.
In accordance with UK Companies Act 2006 s831 2, a public company may make a distribution only if, after giving effect to such distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate of its called up share capital and non-distributable reserves as shown in the relevant accounts.
The loss for the financial year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is 934 million 2014: 10,970 million profit.
The Board is responsible for the Groups capital management including the approval of dividends.
This includes an assessment of both the level of reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following any proposed distribution.
As Vodafone Group Plc is a Group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company.
The major factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for distributable reserves on an ongoing basis include: a the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the relevant entities: a the location of these entities in the Groups corporate structure: a profit and cash flow generation in those entities: and a the risk of adverse changes in business valuations giving rise to investment impairment charges, reducing profits available for distribution.
The Groups consolidated reserves set out on page 107 do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group.
The auditors remuneration for the current year in respect of audit and audit-related services was 2.0 million 2014: 0.9 million and for non-audit services was 2.0 million 2014: 3.5 million.
The Directors are remunerated by the Company for their services to the Group as a whole.
No remuneration was paid to them specifically in respect of their services to Vodafone Group Plc for either year.
Full details of the Directors remuneration are disclosed in Directors remuneration on pages 75 to 91.
There were no employees other than directors of the Company throughout the current or the preceding year.
