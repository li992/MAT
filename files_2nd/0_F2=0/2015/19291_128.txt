Prior to 1 January 1998 all goodwill was written o to reserves on the date of acquisition.
For acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 no value was ascribed to intangibles other than goodwill and the goodwill on each acquisition was amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
On adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2003, the Group chose not to restate the goodwill balance and at that date the balance was frozen i. e. amortisation ceased.
If goodwill had been restated then a signi cant value would have been ascribed to other intangible assets, which would be subject to amortisation, and the carrying value of goodwill would be signi cantly lower.
For acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 value has been ascribed to other intangible assets which are amortised.
Other intangible assets Other intangibles acquired include content, technology and software rights.
Intangible assets are valued separately for each acquisition and the primary method of valuation used is the discounted cash ow method.
The majority of acquired intangibles are amortised using an amortisation pro le based on the projected cash ows underlying the acquisition date valuation of the intangible asset, which generally results in a larger proportion of amortisation being recognised in the early years of the assets life.
The Group keeps the expected pattern of consumption under review.
Amortisation of 13m 2014: 12m is included in the income statement in cost of goods sold and 247m 2014: 223m in operating expenses.
In 2015, 16m 2014: 15m of amortisation relates to discontinued operations.

Following a reorganisation of the business e ective 1 January 2014 goodwill was allocated to CGUs, or an aggregation of CGUs, where goodwill could not be reasonably allocated to individual business units.
Impairment reviews were conducted on these CGUs.
The carrying value of the goodwill in each of the CGUs, after the impact of impairments, is summarised below: All gures in millions 2015 2014 North America 3,155 3,422 Core 635 618 Growth includes Brazil, China, India and South Africa 612 Pearson VUE 344 327 Financial Times Group 51 Total 4,134 5,030 The recoverable amount of each aggregated cash generating unit CGU is based on fair value less costs of disposal or value in use calculations as appropriate.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with inde nite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash ows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate uctuations.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill continued Following signi cant economic and market deterioration in the Groups operations in emerging markets and ongoing cyclical and policy-related pressures in the Groups mature market operations, managements expectations of future returns were revised down in the course of 2015.
It was determined during the impairment review that the fair value less costs of disposal of the Growth, North America and Core CGUs no longer supported the carrying value of the goodwill.
An impairment of 507m was booked in respect of the Groups Growth operations, representing impairments of 269m in the Brazil CGU, 181m in the China CGU, 48m in the South Africa CGU and 9m in the Other Growth CGU, thereby bringing the carrying value of goodwill in those CGUs down to nil.
Impairments of 10m and 13m were also booked in respect of other acquired intangibles in the South Africa and Other Growth CGUs respectively, bringing their carrying value down to nil.
Impairments of 282m and 37m were also booked in respect of the North America and Core CGUs respectively, bringing the carrying value of the goodwill in those CGUs down to fair value less costs of disposal.
Fair value less costs of disposal was determined using post-tax discount rates of 17.4% for Brazil, 11.0% for China, 13.6% for South Africa, 12.8% for Other Growth, 8.6% for North America and 8.7% for Core.
Following the above impairments, the recoverable amounts of the Growth, North America and Core CGUs are 350m, 4,750m and 926m respectively.
Key assumptions For the purpose of estimating the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGUs, management has used an income approach based on present value techniques.
The calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period, managements best estimate about future developments and market assumptions.
The fair value less costs of disposal measurement is categorised as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy.
The key assumptions used by management in the fair value less costs of disposal calculations were: Discount rates The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to re ect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each speci c CGU.
The average post-tax discount rates range from 7.2% to 17.4%.
Discount rates are lower for those businesses which operate in more mature markets with low in ation and higher for those operating in emerging markets with higher in ation.
Perpetuity growth rates A perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% 2014: 2.0% was used for cash ows subsequent to the approved budget period for CGUs operating in mature markets.
This perpetuity growth rate is a conservative rate and is considered to be lower than the long-term historical growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and the long-term growth rate prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
CGU growth rates between 5.0% and 8.5% were used for cash ows subsequent to the approved budget period for CGUs operating in emerging markets with high in ation.
These growth rates are also below the long-term historical growth rates in these markets.
The key assumptions used by management in setting the financial budgets for the initial five-year period were as follows: Forecast sales growth rates Forecast sales growth rates are based on past experience adjusted for the strategic direction and near-term investment priorities within each CGU.
Key factors include USA and UK college enrolment rates, assessment growth rates, the success of new product launches, growth rates and economic conditions in emerging markets and the rate of growth in new services businesses.
The five-year sales forecasts use average nominal growth rates between 1.1% and 1.6% for mature markets and between 0.1% and 5.6% for emerging markets with high in ation.
Operating pro ts Operating pro ts are forecast based on historical experience of operating margins, adjusted for the impact of changes to product costs and cost saving initiatives, including the impact of the global restructuring programme planned in 2016.
Cash conversion Cash conversion is the ratio of operating cash ow to operating pro t. Management forecasts cash conversion rates based on historical experience, adjusted for the impact of product investment priorities and the shift to digital and service based business.
