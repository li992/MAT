Impairments Impairment losses and impairment reversals in each segment are described below.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to impairments see Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill within Note 1.
For information on impairments recognized by joint ventures see Note 15.
Upstream The 2015 impairment losses of $2,484 million included $761 million in Angola, of which $371 million related to the Greater Plutonio cash-generating unit CGU, which has a recoverable amount of $2,222 million.
Impairment losses also included $830 million in relation to CGUs in the North Sea, of which $328 million relates to the Andrew area CGU, which has a recoverable amount of $766 million.
The impairment losses primarily arose as a result of a lower price environment in the near term, and were also affected to a lesser extent by certain technical reserves revisions and increases in decommissioning cost estimates.
The 2015 impairment reversals of $1,080 million included $945 million in the North Sea business, of which $473 million related to the Eastern Trough Area Project ETAP CGU, which has a recoverable amount of $2,489 million.
The impairment reversals mainly arose as a result of decreases in cost estimates and a reduction in the discount rate applied, offsetting the impact of lower prices in the near term.
Impairment losses and reversals relate to producing assets.
The recoverable amounts of the Greater Plutonio CGU, the Andrew area CGU, and the ETAP CGU are their values in use.
See Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill within Note 1 for further information on assumptions used for impairment testing.
The discount rate used to determine the recoverable amount of the Greater Plutonio CGU included the 2% premium for higher-risk countries as described in Note 1: a premium was not applied in determining the recoverable amount of the other CGUs.
The 2014 impairment losses of $6,737 million included $4,876 million in relation to CGUs in the North Sea, of which $1,964 million related to the Valhall CGU, $660 million related to the Andrew area CGU, and $515 million related to the ETAP CGU.
