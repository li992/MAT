Contingencies and capital commitments a VAT legal case The Company is one of a number of claimants in a case brought against HMRC to seek recovery of VAT paid on Management fees in the period 1997 to 2000, together with interest on a compound basis.
The case was heard in the Court of Appeal in October 2014.
The Courts decision passed down in 2015 was that the claimants are entitled to recover a proportion of the VAT paid in mistake of law.
Both HMRC and the claimants have appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which will hear the case in May 2016.
As a consequence of the continuing uncertainty over the outcome of the case, no VAT or related interest recovery has been accrued or recognised as a contingent asset.
PwC are assisting the Company and other claimants in the Supreme Court and their fee in respect of the claim by the Company is contingent on the successful outcome of the case.
