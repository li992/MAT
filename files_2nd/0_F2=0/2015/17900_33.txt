Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 449.4m 2014: 305.4m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as cancelled, which was 987.2m 2014: 979.1m shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 449.4m 2014: 305.4m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options from the start of the year, giving a figure of 1,008.4m 2014: 1,004.7m shares.

Goodwill Group m Cost At 1 July 2013, 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015 816.7 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 July 2013, 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015 24.5 Carrying amount At 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015 792.2 The Groups goodwill has a carrying value of 792.2m relating to the housebuilding segment.
The goodwill relating to the commercial developments segment, with a cost of 24.5m, was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2015 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.
The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and then to assets on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment.
The first two years of cash flows were determined using the Groups approved detailed site-by-site business plan.
The cash flows for the third to fifth years were determined using Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases and work in progress levels.
The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon the expected long term growth rate of the UK economy.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were: Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Groups housebuilding business.
Accordingly, the rate of 14.0% 2014: 12.6% is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate, being the Groups estimated long term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The rate used in the 30 June 2015 impairment review is calculated using the average capital structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, due to the cyclicality of the Groups borrowing requirements and reflects the Groups reduced borrowing costs following the comprehensive refinancing completed during the prior year.
Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions and product type.
For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and planning permissions.
Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that given the current position of the housebuilding segment and the expectations as to its future performance based upon current forecasts for sales volumes and expected changes in both selling prices and costs to complete, the housebuilding segments goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired.
The recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by 1,547.4m 2014: 1,213.2m.
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 4.5% per annum 2014: 3.3% per annum or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 4.3% 2014: 2.9% and all other variables were held constant, then the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value.

The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
At 30 June 2015, an impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 10.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments valued at 7.0m prior to amortisation was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-tobusiness brand operating in niche markets.
Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.

These loans are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property after the first mortgage charge.
These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment.
The Consolidated Income Statement includes a net impairment charge of 8.5mand a profit on disposal of 9.9m 2014: impairment reversal of 2.8m and profit on disposal of 2.4m in cost of sales note 5.
The present value of expected future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second charge loan of a similar amount and duration.
This is considered to be the most appropriate rate as the interest free loans are similar in nature to second charge loans offered by third party financial institutions.
The average discount rate used for the year ended 30 June 2015 was 7.5% 2014: 8.0%.
A fair value adjustment credit of 5.1m 2014: 0.7m has been taken through other comprehensive income reflecting the unwinding of the discount in the year.
The estimated fair value is based on original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance for low single-digit sales price inflation.
The Group has also used independent valuation specialists in prior years to review and assess the estimated portfolio value, which has been updated using house price indices.
The repayment profile used to calculate the timing of future cash flows is based on historical data for first-time buyers selling their property.
The net impairment charge reversal of the available for sale financial assets taken through the Consolidated Income Statement relates to borrower default including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or the first charge provider and the impact of the change in UK house prices on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of these assets.

Trade and other payables include land payables, which may bear interest on a contract specific basis, and items secured by legal charge as disclosed in note 21.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: The fair values of the secured loan available for sale financial assets are calculated using an internal valuation model.
The model calculates the fair value on a loan by loan basis using the present value of expected future cash flows of each loan.
The future value of each loan is based on original selling prices adjusted for regional house price inflation, which in turn is based upon independent valuation specialists and official published valuation data.
Each loan includes an allowance for future low single-digit house price inflation on the property.
In addition, the Group includes an allowance for borrower default, including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or first charge provider.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates for similar instruments.
The fair value trade and payables for both the current and prior years are measured using unobservable inputs in accordance with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as they include land payables which bear interest on a contract specific basis, which require discounting to determine a fair value.
The fair value of trade and other receivables for both the current and prior years are measured in accordance with Level 3.
The Directors consider the carrying amounts of financial assets recognised in the consolidated financial statements approximate to their fair values.
The following table provides an analysis of financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2015, which is based on third party valuations, was an asset of 2.3m 2014: liability of 1.8m with a gain of 4.1m 2014: loss of 7.3m credited directly to equity in the year.
Financial risk management The Groups approach to risk management and the principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 40 to 45.
The Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 24, 25 and 26.
The Groups operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department.
These forecasts are further stress-tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board.
The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.
a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and medium term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The Groups borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May: and October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends in income.
Accordingly, the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements.
On a normal operating basis, the Group has a policy of maintaining a minimum headroom of 150.0m.
The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations.
At 30 June 2015, the Group had committed bank and other facilities of 887.7m 2014: 880.8m and total facilities of 958.9m 2014: 932.0m.
The Groups drawn debt, excluding fees, against the committed facilities was 186.2m 2014: 180.8m.
This represented 21.0% 2014: 20.5% of available committed facilities at 30 June 2015.
In addition, the Group had 360.4m 2014: 274.7m of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2015.
At the date of approval of the Financial Statements, the Groups internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future, being at least twelve months from the date of signing these Financial Statements.
The Groups objective is to minimise refinancing risk.
The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years.
At 30 June 2015, the average maturity of the Groups facilities was 4.0 years 2014: 3.7 years.

b Market risk price risk i UK housing market risk This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group Balance Sheet.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Groups earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing.
However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions.
The Group has detailed procedures to manage its market related operational risks, which include: a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash flow projections: the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision: and collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these Financial Statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and intangible assets.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities, which are directly linked to the UK housing market, are as follows: Linked to UK Not linked to housing UK housing market market Total Group m m m 2015 Non-derivative financial assets 107.0 473.0 580.0 Non-derivative financial liabilities 1,884.3 1,884.3 Derivatives 14.7 14.7 107.0 1,426.0 1,319.0 2014 Non-derivative financial assets 122.4 362.5 484.9 Non-derivative financial liabilities 1,517.5 1,517.5 Derivatives 21.2 21.2 122.4 1,176.2 1,053.8 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Barratt Developments PLC 145 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 27.
Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued i UK housing market risk continued The value of the Groups available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market.
At 30 June 2015, these assets were carried at a fair value of 107.0m 2014: 122.4m.
Further information is set out in note 17.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis The value of the Groups house price linked financial assets, which are solely available for sale financial assets, is sensitive to UK house prices since the amount repayable is dependent upon the market price of the property to which the loan is linked.
At 30 June 2015, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial assets and liabilities would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 5.8m 2014: 2.7m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
In addition the value of the asset is affected by mortgage rates, the availability of finance and UK economic conditions since all of these affect the risk of default.
ii Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long term fixed rate funding and medium term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility for the Groups operational requirements.
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relatingto interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of US Dollar denominated private placements.
The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy and the Groups interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.
The Groups policy target is for 0-40% of average borrowings over the 3 year plan period to be at fixed rates of interest.
Due to the seasonality of the Groups funding requirements, 105.4% 2014: 87.2% of the Groups gross borrowings were fixed as at 30 June 2015 and the average over the 3 year plan period is 43.2%.
Group interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.
The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Group m m m m 2015 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 115.1 61.4 1,707.8 1,884.3 Impact of interest rate swaps 137.0 137.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 21.9 198.4 1,707.8 1,884.3 2014 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 152.5 47.6 1,317.4 1,517.5 Impact of interest rate swaps 137.0 137.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 15.5 184.6 1,317.4 1,517.5 The exposure of the Companys financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Company m m m m 2015 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 169.7 50.4 14.4 234.5 Impact of interest rate swaps 137.0 137.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 32.7 187.4 14.4 234.5 2014 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 188.0 46.1 13.4 247.5 Impact of interest rate swaps 137.0 137.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 51.0 183.1 13.4 247.5 Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to the UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2015 was 3.1% 2014: 3.4%.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of 50.4m 2014: 46.1m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2015 was 8.1% 2014: 8.2% with, at 30 June 2015, a weighted average period of 2.2 years 2014: 3.2 years for which the rate is fixed.
Barratt Developments PLC 146 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27.
Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued ii Interest rate risk continued Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2015, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher lower, as this is a reasonably possible change, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax profit would decrease increase by 0.9m 2014: 0.7m, the Groups post-tax profit would decrease increase by 0.6m 2014: 0.5m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 0.6m 2014: 0.5m.
iii Foreign exchange rate risk As at 30 June 2015, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $80.0m 2014: $80.0m.
In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and a significant proportion of the interest payments.
The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges, which fully hedge the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and the US Dollar interest payments.
Details of the Groups foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 26.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2015, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax profit would decrease increase by nil 2014: nil, the Groups post-tax profit would decrease increase by nil 2014: nil and the Groups equity would decrease increase by nil 2014: nil.
c Credit risk In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered Providers for affordable housing.
The Group has 107.0m 2014: 122.4m of available for sale financial assets, which expose it to credit risk, although this asset is spread over a large number of properties.
In addition, the Group and Company have an investment of 25.6m 2014: 25.6m in a joint venture that holds available for sale financial assets, which exposes the joint venture to credit risk, although this is spread over a large number of properties.
Included within trade and other receivables 45.9m 2014: 41.4m is due from the Homes and Communities Agency in respect of the Help to Buy scheme.
Since this receivable is due from a UK Government agency, the Group considers that this receivable has an insignificant risk of default.
Other than this, neither the Group nor the Company have a significant concentration of credit risk, as their exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways: The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings, as set by international credit rating agencies, and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2015 was 64.4m 2014: 71.8m of cash on deposit with a financial institution.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
As at 30 June 2015, the Company was exposed to 695.6m 2014: 810.2m of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings.
The Company was also exposed to credit risk through its joint venture as explained above.
Further details are provided in notes 34 and 35. d Capital risk management cash flow risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity, its bank borrowings being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans and its private placement notes, as set out in note 25.
The management of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 40 to 45.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short term and long term capital structure include: adjusting the level of dividends and special cash payments paid to shareholders assuming the Company is paying a dividend or a special cash payment : issuing new share capital: arranging debt to meet liability payments: and selling assets to reduce debt.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
a Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees, under which it pays contributions to an independently administered fund.
Contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of the employees pay and once these have been paid, theGroup has no further obligations under these schemes.
2015 2014 m m Contributions during the year Group defined contribution schemes Consolidated Income Statement charge 8.1 7.8 At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of 0.9m 2014: 0.8m, which were paid on or before the due date.
b Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in Great Britain, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme, which with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions.
Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in place for current employees.
The Scheme provides benefits to members based on their length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing active accrual if earlier.
The Group operates the Scheme under the UK regulatory framework, with a legally separate fund that is Trustee-administered.
The Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the Scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments and for the investment policy with regard to scheme assets.
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and investment performance.
In order to assess the level of contributions, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2013.
The results of this valuation have been updated to 30 June 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Group has agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme to make contributions to the Scheme of 13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015 and then 9.5m per annum until 31 December 2016 to address the Schemes actuarial deficit.
The Group also continues to meet the Schemes administration expenses and Pension Protection Fund levy.
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of 1.1m 2014: 1.1m.
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant being: Risk Description Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation DBO is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create a plan deficit.
The Scheme holds a proportion of its assets in equities and other growth assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term.
However, returns are likely to be volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short term cash requirements and an increase in the defined benefit obligation recorded on the Balance Sheet.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the funding and accounting liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes investments in corporate and government bonds.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation, with higher inflation leading to higher liabilities.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide a pension for the life of each of the members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
For the purposes of calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the Scheme, the assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair bid value.
The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: Principal actuarial assumptions 2015 2014 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations Discount rate 3.80% 4.30% Rate of price inflation 3.30% 3.30% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 4.30% 4.70% Rate of price inflation 3.30% 3.40% Members are assumed to exchange 19% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Limited, the Groups actuarial advisers.

Retirement benefit obligations continued b Defined benefit scheme continued The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the Scheme liabilities: Assumptions Male Female Retired member born in 1950 life expectancy at age 65 23.6 years 26.1 years Non-retired member born in 1970 life expectancy at age 65 25.4 years 28.1 years The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S1NA mortality tables with an adjustment to allow for the Scheme members being 1.5 years younger than the population of the S1NA mortality tables.
Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the CMI 2014 projections with a long term trend of 1.25% per annum 2014: 1.25% per annum.
