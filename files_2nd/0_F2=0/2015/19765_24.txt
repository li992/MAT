Retirement benefit obligations continued The table below details the movements in the pension liability and assets recorded through the income statement and other comprehensive income.
The key risks of the defined benefit pension scheme are detailed below along with the Groups approach to them.
Fair value Asset liability Risk Description Present value of scheme recognised on Asset volatility The funding liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to government bond yields, with allowance for million of obligation assets balance sheet additional return to be generated from the investment portfolio.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate At 1 January 2015 2,186.2 2,003.8 182.4 set with reference to corporate bond yields.
The TWPS holds a large proportion of its assets in equities and other return-seeking Current service cost assets.
The returns on such assets tend to be volatile and are not correlated to government bonds or corporate bonds.
This Administration expenses 3.2 3.2 means that the funding level is likely to be volatile in the short-term, potentially resulting in short-term cash requirements and an increase in the net defined benefit liability recorded on the balance sheet.
However, the Group believes that equities offer the best Past service cost settlements returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
The TWPS assets are well-diversified by investing in a range of asset Interest expense income 74.3 68.3 6.0 classes, including property, government bonds and corporate bonds.
There are a number of hedging strategies in place these Total amount recognised in income statement 74.3 65.1 9.2 are mentioned below.
A summary of the target asset allocations of the TWPS, excluding hedging and insurance policies, is shown below: Return on scheme assets not included in income statement 72.5 72.5 TWPS Change in demographic assumptions Liability matching assets 45.4% Change in financial assumptions 49.2 49.2 Equity 6.8% Experience gains 14.7 14.7 Alternative return-seeking assets 47.8% Total remeasurements in other comprehensive income 63.9 72.5 8.6 These target allocations were revised in September 2015.
Employer contributions 23.1 23.1 Changes in Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities.
However, the investment in corporate and government Employee contributions bond yields bonds offers a degree of matching, i. e. the movement in assets arising from changes in bond yields partially matches the Benefit payments 130.4 130.4 movement in the funding or accounting liabilities.
In this way, the exposure to movements in bond yields is reduced.
At 31 December 2015 2,066.2 1,889.1 177.1 Investing in In order to maintain appropriate diversification of investments within the TWPS assets and to take advantage of overseas foreign currency investment returns, a proportion of the underlying investment portfolio is invested overseas.
To balance the risk of investing in foreign currencies while having an obligation to settle benefits in Sterling, a currency hedging programme, using forward foreign Fair value Asset liability exchange contracts, has been put in place to reduce the currency exposure of these overseas investments to the targeted level.
Present value of scheme recognised on million of obligation assets balance sheet Asset liability In order to maintain and increase the TWPS economic exposure to interest rates and inflation rates, a liability hedging At 1 January 2014 2,035.2 1,853.0 182.2 mismatch programme has been put in place.
Repurchase agreements are being used to achieve the TWPS agreed target level of Current service cost liability hedging in an unfunded way and hence to reduce the investment risk of the TWPS assets relative to the liabilities.
Illiquidity Insurance policies and real estate make up 281.2 million 15% of the asset portfolio of TWPS.
Excluding these amounts Administration expenses 3.1 3.1 approximately 75% of assets are managed either in segregated accounts or daily weekly dealt pooled funds and can therefore Past service cost settlements be realised within a few business days under normal market conditions.
Of the remaining investments a further 20% are in pooled Interest expense income 91.1 83.6 7.5 funds with monthly redemption dates.
The remainder could be redeemed within approximately three months of notification in Total amount recognised in income statement 91.1 80.5 10.6 normal market conditions.
Life expectancy The majority of the TWPS obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will Return on scheme assets not included in income statement 144.4 144.4 result in an increase in the TWPS liabilities.
The inflation-linked nature of the benefit payments from the TWPS result increases Change in demographic assumptions 75.7 75.7 the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in life expectancy.
Change in financial assumptions 251.2 251.2 Additional areas of risk management Experience gains 5.2 5.2 During the last quarter of 2014, the Group reached agreement with Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited to insure the benefits of certain Total remeasurements in other comprehensive income 170.3 144.4 25.9 members through a medically underwritten buy-in.
These members represent the 10% of members with the greatest anticipated liability of the scheme.
By insuring these members, the Group has removed more than 10% of risk from the scheme by significantly reducing the longevity of a large proportion of the liabilities.
The Group remains ultimately liable for the payments, and as such the obligation is unchanged: however the medically Employer contributions 36.3 36.3 underwritten insurance policy has been recognised as a scheme insured asset.
Employee contributions During 2014, scheme deferred members were offered flexible retirement options under the scheme rules, which allowed participants to realise part Benefit payments 110.4 110.4 of their pension at an earlier date than previously anticipated.
By discharging some liabilities at an earlier date, the actuarial risk attached to the scheme At 31 December 2014 2,186.2 2,003.8 182.4 has reduced.
Risks and risk management The TWPS, in common with the majority of such defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, has a number of areas of risk.
These areas of risk, and the ways in which the Group has sought to manage them, are set out in the table on page 127.
The risks are considered from both a funding perspective, which drives the cash commitments of the Group, and from an accounting perspective, i. e. the extent to which such risks affect the amounts recorded in the Groups financial statements.
Although investment decisions in the UK are the responsibility of the Trustees, the Group takes an active interest to ensure that pension scheme risks are managed efficiently.
The Group has regular meetings with the Trustees to discuss investment performance, regulatory changes and proposals to actively manage the deficit.
