GSK recognised Theravance as an associate on 1 September 2015, following the expiry of a governance agreement related to the Groups investment in the company.
Under the terms of that governance agreement, the Group was required with certain limited exceptions to vote its shares either in support of the recommendation of the independent directors of the board or in proportion to other shareholders votes cast.
The expiry of the governance agreement and removal of this voting rights restriction was considered to provide the Group with the ability to exert significant inuence over the activities of the company.
