Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Segmental reporting The Group operates through two segments, Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN.
Following the formation of the EthosEnergy joint venture in 2014, all of the Groups predominantly opex related turbine activities are carried out through joint ventures and now managed and reported as part of Wood Group PSN.
In order to provide visibility over the performance of the turbine activities, they are included on a separate line in the table below Wood Group PSN Turbine activities.
This presentation is consistent with the Groups internal management reporting.
Under IFRS 11 Joint arrangements, the Group is required to account for joint ventures using equity accounting, however for management reporting the Group continues to use proportional consolidation, hence the inclusion of the proportional presentation in this note.
The segment information provided to the Groups Chief Executive for the reportable operating segments for the year ended 31 December 2015 includes the following: 1 Reportable Operating Segments 1 1 Revenue EBITDA EBITA Operating profit Year ended 31 Dec Year ended 31 Dec Year ended 31 Dec Year ended 31 Dec 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Wood Group Engineering 1,728.6 2,130.7 232.2 248.1 214.7 232.0 159.7 203.9 Wood Group PSN Production Services 3,447.8 4,636.0 286.7 368.0 258.0 341.7 190.2 336.1 Wood Group PSN Turbine activities 676.0 849.7 56.1 47.3 44.2 33.3 116.7 28.5 Well Support divested - - - - - - 10.4 - 2 Central costs - - 43.3 52.8 47.2 57.4 54.1 82.5 Total 5,852.4 7,616.4 531.7 610.6 469.7 549.6 189.5 486.0 Remove discontinued - 188.5 - 0.7 - 1.7 10.4 27.3 Remove share of joint ventures 851.8 853.8 59.9 53.2 46.7 38.5 46.3 45.9 Total continuing operations excluding joint ventures 5,000.6 6,574.1 471.8 556.7 423.0 512.8 132.8 467.4 Share of post-tax profit from joint ventures 26.6 30.0 Operating profit 159.4 497.4 Finance income 3.1 1.4 Finance expense 23.9 23.7 Profit before taxation from continuing operations 138.6 475.1 Taxation 62.0 112.9 Profit for the year from continuing operations 76.6 362.2 3 Profit loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 13.5 25.9 Profit for the year 90.1 336.3 Notes 1.
