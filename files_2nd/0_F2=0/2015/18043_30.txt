Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units.
In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash-generating unit CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable CGUs within the Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
CGUs have been identified within the reporting segments asthose businesses that generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to .
Following acquisition in 2015, the Outland Group, a business based in Canada, has been integrated into the Groups Support services reporting segment and consequently the provisional goodwill recognised on this acquisition has been allocated to the Support services CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use in 2015 was determined on a similar basis to 2014.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2015 in the light of the continuing challenging economic environment.
The potential impacts of macro-economic factors on the financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers continues to be mitigated by applying rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
In determining the pre-tax discount rate management has derived a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGUs in the Construction services excluding the Middle East segment was 9.7 per cent 2014: 11.0 per cent and for the CGUs in the Support services segment was 8.6 per cent 2014: 9.7 per cent.
The cash flows used to determine the value-in-use calculations are based upon the latest three-year forecasts approved by management, which are based upon secured and probable orders and the Groups overall strategic direction.
The cash flows are extrapolated from year four, with a terminal value using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent, which does not exceed the long-term industry average.
Management has undertaken sensitivity analysis on a number of key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to increase to a minimum of 20.4 per cent for Construction services excluding the Middle East and to a minimum of 15.8 per cent for Support services before an impairment was triggered in any CGU.
On the basis of the sensitivity analysis undertaken in relation to cash flows, management concluded that there is a more than adequate amount of headroom in the value-in-use calculations before an impairment would be triggered.
Overall, as at 31 December 2015, based on internal valuations, management has concluded that the recoverable value of the Groups CGUs exceeded their carrying amount.

In December 2014, the Group issued 170 million of unsecured convertible bonds maturing by December 2019 with a coupon of 2.5 per cent payable semi-annually in arrears.
The initial conversion price was set at 398.56 pence and upon conversion Carillion may elect to settle its obligations by way of delivery of ordinary shares, payment of a cash alternative amount or a combination of the two.
At inception, the proceeds from the convertible bond comprised a derivative liability component of 13.4 million and a debt component of 156.6 million.
The embedded derivative component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company or to settle in cash and is calculated using a Black Scholes or similar bespoke model.
The fair value of the debt component is calculated as the difference between the proceeds from the issue and the fair value of the embedded derivative component.
The debt component at 31 December 2015 amounted to 159.4 million and included 2.8 million of interest accretion.

In December 2014, the Group issued 170 million of unsecured convertible bonds.
The bonds mature by December 2019, and upon conversion, Carillion may elect to settle its obligations by way of delivery of ordinary shares, payment of a cash alternative or a combination of the two.
The initial conversion price has been set at 398.56 pence and upon conversion could lead to the issue of up to 42.7 million new shares, representing 9.9per cent of the current issued share capital.
Reserves Share premium reserve The share premium reserve contains the premium in excess of par value arising on the issue of share capital, net of issue expenses.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve The merger reserve initially arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem on 23February 2006, Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 and Carillion Energy Services on 21 April 2011, whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The premium on the shares issued in relation to these acquisitions has been credited to the merger reserve rather than the share premium account in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The 7.2 million 2014: 13.7 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amounts realised following the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movement in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 1 January Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 0.4 0.5 Acquisition of own shares 0.4 0.5 At 31 December At 31 December 2015, the ESOP held 6,578 2014: seven of the Companys shares and had a market value of 19,925 2014: 24.
During the year the Company acquired 122,272 of its own shares for 0.4 million to meet the plans commitments.
The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
The Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
At 31 December 2015 the total number of shares held by the QUEST amounted to 84,593 2014: 84,593 and had a market value of 0.3 million 2014: 0.3 million.
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
The retained earnings reserve includes the credit transferred from the merger reserve of 7.2 million 2014: 13.7 million noted above.

Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles Executive Directors and senior employees to shares in the Company.
Full details of the Groups share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 57 to 72.
In addition, under the terms of the Groups bonus arrangements, senior employees and Executive Directors receive a proportion of their annual bonus in shares, which vest a year after the award in respect of senior employees and three years after the award in respect of Executive Directors.

Deferred bonus scheme 321,315 Three years of service for Executive Directors and 1-3 years Nil one year of service for senior employees.
Total share options 3,430,655 The number and weighted average exercise prices of all of the Groups share options is as follows: Number Number of options of options 2015 2014 At 1 January 2,986,247 2,718,393 Lapsed during the year 937,208 699,270 Forfeited during the year 44,748 16,871 Exercised during the year 121,804 118,578 Granted during the year 1,548,168 1,102,573 At 31 December 3,430,655 2,986,247 Exercisable at the end of the year There were no share options exercisable at the end of 2015.
The weighted average exercise price and the weighted average share price during the year was Nil and 329.1 pence respectively.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model and the following assumptions: 2015 2014 LEAP LEAP Fair value of share options and assumptions Fair value at grant date 283.0p 310.0p Share price at grant date 329.4p 363.6p Exercise price Nil Nil Expected volatility 11.20% 11.64% Option life 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 5.10% 5.59% Risk-free interest rate based on national Government bonds 2.54% 0.64% The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

The estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest ignores the possibility that market conditions will or will not be achieved given that these market conditions are already included in the fair value of the options.

Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.

Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies are to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to financial risk or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 108 Financial statements 27.
Financial instruments continued The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations in overseas regions, primarily the Middle East and Canada.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, the Groups policy is that foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing and forward contracts denominated in the relevant foreign currencies, or where this is not practicable, in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
The Group has US$280 million of private placement finance at fixed interest rates from a number of United States of America based investors in order to provide greater flexibility in relation to the maturity profile of Group borrowing.
The Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility in relation to the associated capital and interest payments.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless a distribution is planned.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Further details concerning the risks associated with the overseas regions in which the Group operates can be found in the Performance and financial review on page 40.
Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2015 2014 m m United States of America dollar 207.6 195.6 Canadian dollar 65.3 95.2 United Arab Emirates dirham 8.3 7.9 Other 2.5 2.8 283.7 301.5 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 283.7 million 2014: 301.5 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency net asset amounts to 73.4 million 2014: 78.3 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 4.9 million 2014: 0.1 million gain on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve as these hedging loans are effective hedges.
Exposure to United States of America dollar denominated private placement borrowing included above amounting to 190.5 million 2014: 179.5 million is hedged by cross-currency derivative instruments as disclosed on page 111.
The Group does not have a significant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of financial assets.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows: Five per cent increase Five per cent decrease Profit Equity Profit Equity m m m m United States of America dollar 0.8 0.9 Canadian dollar 0.6 10.0 0.6 10.4 Euro 0.1 2.4 0.1 2.7 United Arab Emirates dirham 0.4 4.9 0.4 5.4 Oman rials 0.6 3.4 0.6 3.8 Other 0.3 0.6 0.3 0.6 Interest rate risk The Groups interest-bearing debt is predominantly drawn from committed bank facilities to fund acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements.
Foreign currency denominated borrowings have been drawn under the facilities to hedge net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate, the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate or the Emirates Interbank Offered Rate.
In addition, the Group has secured fixed interest rate finance of 325.5 million from private placements and 170 million from the issue of convertible bonds as disclosed in note 20.
The principal purpose of raising this finance at fixed interest rates is to ensure that a proportion of the Groups borrowing was not subject to floating rates of interest which may increase.
This has been supplemented by a fixed rate interest swap, which swaps the floating rate to a fixed rate on 35million of the Groups principal bank facilities.
In addition, a number of Groups Public Private Partnership joint ventures have entered into interest rateswaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.2 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.5 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 2.4 million, and in respect of United Arab Emirates dirham denominated borrowings an increase of 0.1 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan facility and bilateral facilities supplemented by private placement financing, convertible bonds and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
The average net borrowing during 2015 was 538.9 million 2014: 450.7 million.

Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset.

Trade receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.

A 15.6 million gain 2014: 8.2 million gain has been recognised in the hedging reserve in relation to the forward foreign currency contracts, fixed rate interest derivatives and the cross-currency derivatives which are effective cash flow hedges.
A 1.6 million gain 2014: Nil has been recognised in the translation reserve in relation to the movement in forward foreign currency contracts utilised as net investment hedges of the net assets of overseas operations.
In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP joint ventures are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range up until March 2047.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash flow hedges within joint ventures in the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2015 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP joint ventures amounted to 0.7 million 2014: 14.4 million of which Nil 2014: 3.7 million charge together with the related deferred tax asset of 0.8 million has been recognised in the hedging reserve in 2015.

Financial instruments continued Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-quoted equity shareholdings within non-current asset investments, derivative financial instruments and contingent consideration payable in respect of the acquisition of the Rokstad Corporation and the Outland Group as disclosed in note 30.
The fair value of non-current asset investments and contingent consideration payable is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on market data.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using asset specific discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available-for-sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of contingent consideration payable is calculated by discounting the maximum contractual cash flows that could be paid under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The movement in the fair value of financial instruments derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: Non-current Contingent asset 1 consideration investments m m 1 At 1 January 2015 47.8 9.3 Additions 27.7 0.4 Impairment recognised in the income statement 5.0 Discount unwind recognised in financial expense 2.0 Exchange rate movements recognised in the translation reserve 5.6 Transfer to current liabilities 7.5 At 31 December 2015 64.4 4.7 1 Restated for the retrospective adjustment to provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition of the Rokstad Corporation in 2014.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 0.4 million.
In respect of contingent consideration, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value of the liability of 1.8 million.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement or the hedging reserve as appropriate.
There are no material differences between the fair value and the carrying value of the Groups other financial assets and financial liabilities.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Where the Group makes significant acquisitions, these are financed with a combination of debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure.
In order to have greater flexibility over the maturity profile of debt, the Group has secured 325.5 million of private placement financing with maturity dates between 2017 and 2024 and 170 million of convertible bonds that mature in 2019.
The Group has a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders broadly in line with underlying earnings per share growth, after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions in 2015 On 28 May 2015, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the Outland Group Outland.
Outland provides a complete range of remote site services across a number of growth sectors in Canada, including mining, utilities, forestry, gas and oil.
The total cash consideration, which is capped at approximately 63 million, is dependent on the financial performance of Outland between 2015 and 2017.
The first instalment of the consideration of 10.7 million has been included in the cash flow statement within the acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.
The second instalment of approximately 25 million is due in 2016, with the remainder due in 2018 and 2019.
The fair value of the deferred and contingent consideration is included within liabilities in the balance sheet and is derived from inputs that are not observable in the market.
Consequently, the fair value has been determined using an estimate of the contractual cash flows that could be paid under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement using a risk adjusted discount rate of 3.4 per cent.
A provisional assessment has been made of the fair value of the net assets acquired of 18.6 million, which includes identifiable intangible assets of 7.2 million net of deferred taxation.
This is after excluding goodwill on the Outland acquisition balance sheet of 0.8 million, and provisional fair value adjustments totalling 9.0 million that reduced the carrying value of net assets at the acquisition date.
On the basis of this assessment the provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition amounts to 43.1 million.
On 24 December 2015, the Group acquired a 67 per cent controlling interest in Ask Real Estate Limited, a property development company based in the United Kingdom.
The cash consideration of 4.0 million was paid in January 2016.
No goodwill arose on the acquisition.
The above acquisitions do not have a material impact on the balance sheet of the Group and therefore the full disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations have not been presented.
Total acquisition costs incurred in relation to contracts and due diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities in the year of 2.5 million 2014: 9.9 million have been included in non-operating items in the income statement see note 4.
Acquisitions in 2014 On 24 December 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of a 60 per cent equity shareholding in Rokstad Corporation Rokstad.
Rokstad is a Canadian powerlines and transmission business operating primarily in British Columbia and Alberta and provides the Group with access to markets with strong growth opportunities and where the Group can utilise its expertise.
The total consideration for this acquisition of around 31million is dependent on the financial performance of Rokstad.
The consideration is payable in instalments over the period to July 2017, with 11.1million paid on completion, which was included in the 2014 cash flow statement within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.
The second instalment of the consideration amounting to 6.1 million was paid in 2015 and is included in the cash flow statement within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.
The remaining instalments to be paid in 2016 and 2017, which are dependent on financial performance, will be capped at a combined total of 12 million.
Under the acquisition agreement, Carillion has also committed to acquire the remaining 40 per cent interest in Rokstad after five years at a multiple of 4.5 times Rokstads 2019 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, capped at a maximum additional consideration of 42 million.
The fair value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including the amount to acquire the remaining 40 per cent, is included within liabilities in the balance sheet and is derived from inputs that are not observable in the market.
Consequently, the fair value has been determined using the maximum contractual cash flows that could be paid under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, based on the current expectation that Rokstads financial performance targets will be fully met, using a risk adjusted discount rate of 3.4 per cent.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition of Rokstad to the 2014 year end, a provisional assessment was made of the fair value of the net liabilities acquired of 2.8 million, leading to the recognition of provisional goodwill on the acquisition of 70.1 million.
These provisional assessments became final in 2015 following finalisation of the completion accounts process, leading to the recognition of revised goodwill of 61.9 million.
The reconciliation of the provisional goodwill recognised to the revised goodwill recognised is shown below: m Provisional goodwill 70.1 Intangible assets identified net of a deferred tax liability of 3.0 million 8.5 Amendments to property, plant and equipment 1.0 Amendments to trade and other receivables 2.6 Amendments to trade and other payables 6.6 Amendments to deferred consideration 1.2 Amendments to deferred taxation 1.5 Revised goodwill 61.9 As the adjustments to the provisional amounts recognised in 2014 are within the measurement period, prior year comparatives have been restated by the amounts included in the table above.
On 1 July 2014, following a change to the shareholder agreement, the Group obtained control of CarillionAmey Housing Prime Limited, an entity that was previously subject to joint control.
The principal change made to the shareholder agreement was the ability of the Group to appoint the Chairman of the Board with a casting vote on key operational decisions.
As a result, the Group has control over the entity and has therefore accounted for this change as a deemed step acquisition.
No consideration has been paid and there has been no change to the Groups 67 per cent equity interest in the entity.
The acquisition date fair value of the Groups equity interest already held in CarillionAmey Housing Prime Limited amounted to 8.4 million.
No gain or loss was recognised as a result of remeasuring to fair value the equity interest already held.
An intangible asset of 2.4 million, representing customer contracts, has been recognised on this deemed acquisition.
No goodwill has been recognised.
Non-controlling interests at the acquisition date amounted to 3.2 million representing the proportionate interest in the net assets of the company at the acquisition date.

The disposals generated cash consideration of 54.4 million, which after deducting disposal costs paid of 0.3 million, is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of joint ventures and other investments.
Disposals in 2014 In 2014, the Group disposed of equity interests in four Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated a cash consideration of 37.0million, which together with disposal costs of 1.0 million, was included in the cash flow statement within disposal of joint ventures and other investments, and an operating profit of 13.9 million which is included in Group operating profit within the Public Private Partnership projects segment.
Retirement benefit obligations The Carillion Group operates 14 defined benefit pension schemes for eligible employees, of which 13 are in the UK and one is in Canada.
In addition, the Group provides other post-retirement benefits under four separate arrangements in Canada.
The defined benefit schemes are administered by Trustee Boards which largely comprise independent Trustees together with Company and employee representatives.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the Companys assets and are managed by the Trustee Boards.
Pension scheme valuations are carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding every three years and bi-annually to calculate the IAS 19 deficit included in the financial statements.
Eight of the 14 defined benefit schemes within the Group are closed to future accrual, with payments into these schemes made in line with deficit recovery plans, which have been agreed with pension scheme trustees.

The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to the income statement of 21.1 million 2014: 18.7 million represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified by the scheme rules.
IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 2015 2014 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 3.55% N A 3.55% N A Rate of increase in pensions 3.00% 2.00% 2.95% 2.00% Inflation rate Retail Price Index 3.05% 2.00% 3.05% 2.00% Inflation rate Consumer Price Index 2.00% N A 2.00% N A Discount rate 3.95% 3.75% 3.70% 3.85% The valuation of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is most sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality rates.
A 0.1 per cent reduction in the discount rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 45 million, whilst a 0.1 per cent increase in the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 25 million.
An increase of one year to the mortality rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 70 million, although this would be mitigated in part by the longevity swap acquired by the Trustees in 2013.
The overall weighted average duration of scheme liabilities as at 31 December 2015 is approximately 18 years.
Over the next five years benefits of 569 million are expected to be paid, with a further 658 million expected to be paid over the subsequent five-year period.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

The triennial actuarial valuations as at 31 December 2013 for five of the Groups schemes were concluded with the Trustees in 2014 and a revised deficit recovery plan agreed.
This included the three largest schemes in the Group, namely the Carillion Staff, Mowlem Staff and Alfred McAlpine Staff schemes.
The total assets at the date of the actuarial valuation for all five schemes amounted to 1.8 billion, which represented a funding level of 76 per cent.
The next actuarial valuation for these schemes is due as at 31 December 2016.
The Group expects to make payments totalling 51.8million to defined benefit schemes during the next financial year.
In 2013, a longevity swap was entered into by five of the Groups defined benefit schemes which insures the Group against the financial risk of pensioners in payment living longer than currently expected.
The swap covers around 9,000 pensioners with a combined liability of some 1 billion, which represents around 40 per cent of the total liabilities in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The swap has been recognised as part of scheme assets in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 Retirement benefits.
At 31 December 2015, the fair value of the longevity swap calculated in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair value measurement was a 1.4million liability 2014: 1.6 million liability, with the movement in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Revenue recognition In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to the final out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably, estimates of the final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually review the estimated final out-turn on contracts and make adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to the final out-turn on contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 11 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Retirement benefits In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions, which are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group, have been made in relation to: Expected return on plan assets Inflation rate Mortality Discount rate Salary and pensions increases.
Details of the assumptions used, together with sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality are included in note 31.
Deferred tax In determining the quantum of deferred tax assets to be recognised, judgement is required in assessing the extent to which it is probable that future taxable profit will arise in the companies concerned.
Management use forecasts of future taxable profits and make assumptions on growth rates for each entity at each year end in assessing the recoverability of assets recognised.

Off-balance sheet arrangements The Group is party to a number of contractual arrangements for the purposes of the Groups principal activities that are not required to be included on the Group balance sheet.
The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Group are party to are as follows: Operating leases see note 28 Pledged assets securing finance lease liabilities see note 20 Contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees for deferred equity payments and performance contracts in PPP special purpose entities see note 26 Capital commitments for capital expenditure and equity and subordinated debt in PPP special purpose entities see note 28 Performance and advance payment bonds on construction contracts Outsourcing contracts.
In keeping with normal market practice, performance and advance payment bonds are generally issued to clients in relation to construction contracts.
They provide our clients with protection against the Groups failure to perform and expire based on contractually agreed conditions.
These arrangements are considered to be a part of ordinary trading activities and are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
In respect of outsourcing contracts, the Group has entered into various arrangements to outsource the provision of certain back-office functions with a third-party provider.
These arrangements are on commercial terms and any penalty or termination clauses associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
