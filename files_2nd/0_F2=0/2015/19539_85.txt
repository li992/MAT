Results for the year 2 Segment information This note shows how Group revenue and Group operating profit are split across the three reportable segments in which we operate, being Europe, North America and International South America, Africa, Australia, Middle East and Asia.
In May 2015, following the departure of the CEO of Sage Americas there was a change in the reporting segments with the Brazilian business being moved out of the Americas segment.
For reporting purposes Brazil has been combined with AAMEA, to form the new International segment and the Americas segment was renamed to North America.
The 2014 comparatives have been updated to align with the new segmental reporting.
For each geographical region, revenue and operating profit are compared to prior year in order to understand the movements in the year.
This comparison is provided for statutory, underlying and organic revenue and operating profit.
Statutory results are the IFRS statutory results.
Underlying and underlying as reported are non-GAAP measures.
Adjustments are made to statutory results to arrive at an underlying result which is in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
Adjustments are made for items that are individually important in order to understand the financial performance.
If included, these items could distort understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
See note 3.6 for details of these adjustments.
In addition, the prior year underlying values are translated at current exchange rates, so that exchange rate impacts do not distort comparisons.
Prior year underlying values at prior year exchange rates are underlying as reported: prior year and current year values at current year exchange rates are underlying.
The contributions of current and prior year acquisitions and disposals are removed, so that results can be compared to prior year on a like for like basis.
In addition, the following reconciliations are made in this note.
Revenue per segment reconciled to the profit for the year as per the income statement.
Statutory operating profit reconciled to underlying operating profit per segment detailing the adjustments made.
Accounting policy In accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, information for the Groups operating segments has been derived using the information used by the chief operating decision maker.
The Groups Executive Committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker in accordance with their designated responsibility for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance, through the Quarterly Business Reviews chaired by the CEO and CFO.
The Executive Committee use organic and underlying data to monitor business performance.
Operating segments are reported in a manner which is consistent with the operating segments produced for internal management reporting.
The Group is organised into four key operating segments, with Brazil being aggregated with AAMEA with which there are similar economic characteristics to form the International reporting segment.
The UK is the home country of the parent.
The reporting segments and their main operating territories are as follows: Europe France, UK & Ireland, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal and Sagepay North America US and Canada International Brazil, Africa, Australia, Middle East and Asia The Africa operations are principally based in South Africa: the Middle East and Asia operations are principally based in Singapore, Malaysia and UAE.
