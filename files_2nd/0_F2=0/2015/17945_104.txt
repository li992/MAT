Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits within Note 1.
The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, including an independent director and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
In the US, all employees who previously accrued pension benefits under a final salary plan now accrue benefits from 2015 onwards under a cash balance formula instead.
Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected.
Retired US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement.
The plan is funded and its assets are overseen by a fiduciary investment committee composed of six BP employees appointed by the president of BP Corporation North America Inc. the appointing officer.
The investment committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
In the US, group companies also provide post-retirement healthcare to retired employees and their dependants and, in certain cases, life insurance coverage : the entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion of a minimum period of service.
