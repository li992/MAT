186 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements NOTE 1: BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements of Lloyds BankingGroupplc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASBs predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRSIC and its predecessor body.
The EU endorsed version of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relaxes some of the hedge accounting requirements: the Group has not taken advantage of this relaxation, and therefore there is no difference in application to the Group between IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, available-for-sale financial assets, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts.
As stated on page 108, the directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
During 2015, government debt securities with a carrying value of 19,938million, previously classified as available-for-sale, were reclassified to held-to-maturity.
Unrealised gains on the transferred securities of 194million previously taken to equity continue to be held in the available-for-sale revaluation reserve and are being amortised to the income statement over the remaining lives of the securities using the effective interest method or until the assets become impaired.
Details of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31December 2015 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 57.
NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups accounting policies are set out below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently.
A Consolidation The assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings including structured entities are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date.
Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Details of the Groups subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 299 to 307.
1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power.
This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to any of the above elements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager over the investment activities of the fund.
Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Groups decision making authority over the investment vehicle: the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager: the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision maker: and the Groups exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest it holds in the investment vehicle.
Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest.
Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities.
Structured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity: its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity: the nature of the relationship with the entity: and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of theentity.
The treatment of transactions with non-controlling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions: any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity.
Where the Group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any non-controlling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value: the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retainedinterest.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments see E 5 below or share capital see Q 1 below.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.
2 Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting share capital of the entity.
The Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business.
These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Otherwise, the Groups investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each year to reflect the Groups share of the post-acquisition results of the joint venture or associate based on accounts which are coterminous with the Group or made up 187 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued to a date which is not more than three months before the Groups reporting date.
The share of any losses is restricted to a level that reflects an obligation to fund such losses.
B Goodwill Goodwill arises on business combinations, including the acquisition of subsidiaries, and on the acquisition of interests in joint ventures and associates: goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment.
If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the Groups investment in joint ventures and associates.
At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
C Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include brands, core deposit intangible, purchased credit card relationships, customer-related intangibles and both internally and externally generated capitalised software enhancements.
Intangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: Capitalised software enhancements up to 7 years Brands which have been assessed as having finite lives 10-15 years Customer-related intangibles up to 10 years Core deposit intangible up to 8 years Purchased credit card relationships 5 years Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired.
If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately.
Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised.
Such intangible assets are reassessed annually to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate.
In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate a finite life is determined and an impairment review is performed on the asset.
D Revenue recognition Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all interest-bearing financial instruments using the effective interest method, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, ashorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
The effective interest rate is calculated on initial recognition of the financial asset or liability by estimating the future cash flows after considering all the contractual terms of the instrument but not future credit losses.
The calculation includes all amounts expected to be paid or received by the Group including expected early redemption fees and related penalties and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return.
Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account in the calculation.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss see H below.
Fees and commissions which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are generally recognised when the service has been provided.
Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan once drawn.
Where it is unlikely that loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised over the life of the facility.
Loan syndication fees are recognised as revenue when the syndication has been completed and the Group retains no part of the loan package for itself or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for all interest-bearing financial instruments, including loans and advances, as for the other participants.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Revenue recognition policies specific to life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below see N below : those relating to leases are set out in J 2 below.
E Financial assets and liabilities On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets, held-to-maturity investments or loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred: or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished ie when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expire.
188 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 1 Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading securities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss by management.
Derivatives are carried at fair value see F below.
Trading securities are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains.
Such securities are classified as trading securities and recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such by management upon initial recognition.
Such assets and liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss on acquisition in the following circumstances: it eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets and liabilities or recognising gains or losses on different bases.
The main type of financial assets designated by the Group at fair value through profit or loss are assets backing insurance contracts and investment contracts issued by the Groups life insurance businesses.
Fair value designation allows changes in the fair value of these assets to be recorded in the income statement along with the changes in the value of the associated liabilities, thereby significantly reducing the measurement inconsistency had the assets been classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
the assets and liabilities are part of a group which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, with management information also prepared on this basis.
As noted in A 2 above certain of the Groups investments are managed as venture capital investments and evaluated on the basis of their fair value and these assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
where the assets and liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for.
The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively.
If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Fair value of financial instruments and note50 3 Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
The Group is permitted to reclassify, at fair value at the date of transfer, non-derivative financial assets other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss by the entity upon initial recognition out of the trading category if they are no longer held for the purpose of being sold or repurchased in the near term, as follows: if the financial assets would have met the definition of loans and receivables but for the fact that they had to be classified as held for trading at initial recognition, they may be reclassified into loans and receivables where the Group has the intention and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity: or if the financial assets would not have met the definition of loans and receivables, they may be reclassified out of the held for trading category into available-for-sale financial assets in rare circumstances.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets Debt securities and equity shares that are not classified as trading securities, at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or as loans and receivables areclassified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs.
Available-for-sale financial assets are those intended to be held for an indeterminate period of time and may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale arerecognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold, becomes impaired or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the incomestatement.
The Group is permitted to transfer a financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category where that asset would have met the definition of loans and receivables at the time of reclassification if the financial asset had not been classified as available-for-sale and where there is both the intention and ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future.
Reclassification of a financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the held-to-maturity category is permitted when the Group has the ability and intent to hold that financial asset tomaturity.
Reclassifications are made at fair value as of the reclassification date.
Fair value becomes the new cost or amortised cost as applicable.
Effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to the loans and receivables and held-to-maturity categories are determined at the reclassification date.
Any previous gain or loss on a transferred asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the effective interest method or until the asset becomes impaired.
Any difference between the new amortised cost and the expected cash flows is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using the effective interestmethod.
When an impairment loss is recognised in respect of available-for-sale assets transferred, the unamortised balance of any available-for-sale reserve that remains in equity is transferred to the income statement and recorded as part of the impairmentloss.
189 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 3 Loans and receivables Loans and receivables include loans and advances to banks and customers and eligible assets including those transferred into this category out of the fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale financial assets categories.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers at fair value inclusive of transaction costs or, for eligible assets transferred into this category, their fair value at the date of transfer.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method see D above less provision for impairment see H below.
The Group has entered into securitisation and similar transactions to finance certain loans and advances to customers.
In cases where the securitisation vehicles are funded by the issue of debt, on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio of securitised lending are retained by the Group, these loans and advances continue to be recognised by the Group, together with a corresponding liability forthe funding.
4 Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity other than: those that the Group designates upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss: those that the Group designates as available-for-sale: and those that meet the definition of loans and receivables.
These are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
A sale or reclassification of a more than insignificant amount of held-to-maturity investments would result in the reclassification of all held-to-maturity investments to available-for-sale financial assets.
5 Borrowings Borrowings which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Preference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities.
The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense.
Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments.
Interest payments on these securities are recognised, net of tax, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid.
An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
When a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the original carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in the profit or loss.
6 Sale and repurchase agreements including securities lending and borrowing Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained.
Funds received under these arrangements are included in deposits from banks, customer deposits, or trading liabilities.
Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos, where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are recorded as loans and receivables or trading securities.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured: collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet.
Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and receivable or customer deposit.
F Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting All derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including recent market transactions, and using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and option pricing models, as appropriate.
Derivatives are carried in the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Refer to note3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Fair value of financial instruments and note50 3 Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value fordetails of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that is not part of a hedging relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in financial instruments and insurance contracts unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, a policyholders option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount isnot treated as an embedded derivative.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
The effectiveness of the 190 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded thatit is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of the particular risks inherent in recognised assets or liabilities fairvalue hedges : 2 hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to recognised assets or liabilities cash flow hedges : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
These are accounted for as follows: 1 Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk: this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative adjustment that has been made tothe carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period tomaturity.
2 Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
3 Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivativefinancial instruments.
G Offset Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows.
In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.
H Impairment of financial assets 1 Assets accounted for at amortised cost At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether, as a result of one or more events occurring after initial recognition of the financial asset and prior to the balance sheet date, there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has become impaired.
Where such an event has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, an impairment allowance is recognised.
The amount of impairment allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
If the asset has a variable rate of interest, the discount rate usedfor measuring the impairment allowance is the current effective interest rate.
Subsequent to the recognition of an impairment loss on a financial asset or a group of financial assets, interest income continues to be recognised on an effective interest rate basis, on the assets carrying value net of impairment provisions.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, such as an improvement in the borrowers credit rating, the allowance is adjusted and the amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment allowances are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant.
Such individual assessment is used primarily for the Groups commercial lending portfolios.
Impairment allowances for portfolios of smaller balance homogenous loans such as most residential mortgages, personal loans and credit card balances in the Groups retail portfolios in both the Retail and Consumer Finance divisions that are below the individual assessment thresholds, and for loan losses that have been incurred but not separately identified at the balance sheet date, are determined on a collective basis.
Individual assessment In respect of individually significant financial assets in the Groups commercial lending portfolios, assets are reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed on a watchlist where greater monitoring is undertaken and any adverse or potentially adverse impact on ability to repay is used in assessing whether an asset should be transferred to a dedicated Business Support Unit.
Specific examples of trigger events that could lead to the initial recognition of impairment allowances against lending to corporate borrowers or the recognition of additional impairment allowances include i trading losses, loss of business or major customer of a borrower: ii material breaches of the terms and conditions of a loan facility, including non-payment of interest or principal, or a fall in the value of security such that it is no longer considered adequate: iii disappearance of an active market because of financial difficulties: or iv restructuring a facility with preferential terms to aid recovery of the lending such as a debt for equityswap.
For such individually identified financial assets, a review is undertaken of the expected future cash flows which requires significant management judgement as to the amount and timing of such cash flows.
Where the debt is secured, the assessment reflects the expected cash flows from the realisation of the security, net of costs to realise, whether or not foreclosure or realisation of the collateral is probable.
For impaired debt instruments which are held at amortised cost, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows.
A reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
191 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Collective assessment Impairment is assessed on a collective basis for 1 homogenous groups of loans that are not considered individually impaired: and 2 to cover losses which have been incurred but have not yet been identified on loans subject to individual impairment.
Homogenous groups of loans In respect of portfolios of smaller balance, homogenous loans, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
Segmentation takes into account factors such as the type of asset, industry sector, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the borrowers ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Generally, the impairment trigger used within the impairment calculation for a loan, or group of loans, is when they reach a pre-defined level of delinquency or where the customer is bankrupt.
Loans where the Group provides arrangements that forgive a portion of interest or principal are also deemed to be impaired and loans that are originated to refinance currently impaired assets are also defined as impaired.
In respect of the Groups secured mortgage portfolios, the impairment allowance is calculated based on a definition of impaired loans which are those six months or more in arrears or certain cases where the borrower is bankrupt or is in possession.
The estimated cash flows are calculated based on historical experience and are dependent on estimates of the expected value of collateral which takes into account expected future movements in house prices, less costs to sell.
For unsecured personal lending portfolios, the impairment trigger is generally when the balance is two or more instalments in arrears or where the customer has exhibited one or more of the impairment characteristics set out above.
While the trigger is based on the payment performance or circumstances of each individual asset, the assessment of future cash flows uses historical experience of cohorts of similar portfolios such that the assessment is considered to be collective.
Future cash flows are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the cohort and historical loss experience for similar assets.
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data about economic and credit conditions including unemployment rates and borrowers behaviour to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual lossexperience.
Incurred but not yet identified impairment The collective provision also includes provision for inherent losses, that is losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
The loans that are not currently recognised as impaired are grouped into homogenous portfolios by key risk drivers.
Risk drivers for secured retail lending include the current indexed loan-to-value, previous mortgage arrears, internal cross-product delinquency data and external credit bureau data: for unsecured retail lending they include whether the account is up-to-date and, if not, the number of payments that have been missed: and for commercial lending they include factors such as observed default rates and loss given default.
An assessment is made of the likelihood of each account becoming recognised as impaired within the loss emergence period, with the economic loss that each portfolio is likely to generate were it to become impaired.
The loss emergence period is determined by local management for each portfolio and the Group has a range of loss emergence periods which are dependent upon the characteristics of the portfolios.
Loss emergence periods are reviewed regularly and updated when appropriate.
Ingeneral the periods used across the Group vary between one month and twelve months based on historical experience.
Unsecured portfolios tend to have shorter loss emergence periods than secured portfolios.
Loan renegotiations and forbearance In certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customers loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will not recover the original carrying value of the asset, the asset continues to be reported as past due and is considered impaired.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will recover the original carrying value of the asset, the loan is no longer reported as past due or impaired provided that payments are made in accordance with the revised terms.
Renegotiation may lead to the loan and associated provision being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.
Write offs A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement.
For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that forbearance is no longer appropriate.
For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence for example, third party valuations is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.
Debt for equity exchanges Equity securities acquired in exchange for loans in order to achieve an orderly realisation are accounted for as a disposal of the loan and an acquisition of equity securities, held as available-for-sale.
Where control is obtained over an entity as a result of the transaction, the entity is consolidated: where the Group has significant influence over an entity as a result of the transaction, the investment is accounted for by the equity method of accounting see A above.
Any subsequent impairment of the assets or business acquired is treated as an impairment of the relevant asset or business and not as an impairment of the original instrument.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired.
In addition to the criteria for financial assets accounted for at amortised cost set out above, this assessment involves reviewing the current financial circumstances including creditworthiness and future prospects of the issuer, assessing the future cash flows expected to be realised and, in the case of equity shares, considering whether there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost.
If an impairment loss has been incurred, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the 192 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised, is reclassified from equity to the income statement.
For impaired debt instruments, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows: a reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, an amount not greater than the original impairment loss is credited to the income statement: any excess is taken to other comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
I Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment other than investment property is included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The value of land included in premises is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Premises excluding land : Freehold long and short leasehold premises: shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease.
Leasehold improvements: shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease.
Equipment: Fixtures and furnishings: 10-20 years.
Other equipment and motor vehicles: 2-8 years.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Investment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds.
In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the property such as location or condition.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets.
These valuations are reviewed at least annually by independent professionally qualified valuers.
Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.
For investment property under construction, the value on disposal is considered to be at the point at which the property is fully constructed.
Adjustments are made for the costs and risks associated with construction.
Investment property under construction for which fair value is not yet reliably measurable is valued at cost, until the fair value can be reliably measured.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement as net trading income.
J Leases 1 As lessee The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are charged to the income statement on astraight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the end of the lease period, any payment made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as anexpense in the period of termination.
2 As lessor Assets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of provisions, within loans and advances to banks and customers.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income.
Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.
Operating lease assets are included within tangible fixed assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values.
Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of thelease.
The Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted forseparately.
K Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.
The Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions: there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
Full actuarial valuations of the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years: these valuations are updated to 31 December each year by qualified independent actuaries.
For the purposes of these annual updates scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 193 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued pensionliability.
The Groups income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense income, and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets.
Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
Net interest expense income is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest expense income and net of the cost of managing the plan assets, and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling if applicable are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.
The Groups balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes.
In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and does not anticipate any future acts by other parties that could change the amount of the surplus that may ultimately be recovered.
The costs of the Groups defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
The accounting for share-based compensation is set out in L below.
L Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation.
The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised.
Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Groups Save As You Earn plans are treated as non-vesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period.
Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the incomestatement.
M Taxation Current income tax which is payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
For the Groups long-term insurance businesses, the tax charge is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders returns and tax that is payable on shareholders returns.
This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under current UKtaxrules.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Income tax payable on profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which those profits arise.
The tax effects of losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred and current tax related to gains and losses on the fair value re-measurement of available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges, where these gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Such tax is subsequently transferred to the income statement together with the gain or loss.
Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both a legal right of offset and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
N Insurance The Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business.
Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, which permits with certain exceptions the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS.
The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using UKGAAP, including FRS27 Life Assurance, and UK established practice.
Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: Insurance contracts these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk.
The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur.
These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features.
Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specifiedassets.
Non-participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature.
The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.
194 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 1 Life insurance business i Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts Premiums and claims Premiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received.
Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date orthe date on which the claim is notified.
Liabilities Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Groups with-profit funds Liabilities of the Groups with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authoritys realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus see below.
Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Groups with-profit funds A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised.
The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.
Assumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked Liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate such as for any excess of future expenses over charges.
The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals.
Changes in the value of the liability are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims.
Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.
Unallocated surplus Any amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
ii Accounting for non-participating investment contracts The Groups non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked.
These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value iscontractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Groups unitised investment funds.
The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date.
Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.
The Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested.
These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract.
These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.
Costs which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred.
This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and is reviewed for impairment in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
iii Value of in-force business The Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The asset represents the present value of the shareholders interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date.
This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees.
Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the incomestatement.
The Groups contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts.
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.
2 General insurance business The Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products.
Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer: premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts and only credited to the income 195 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued statement when earned.
Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer.
Provision is made for irrevocable undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon pastexperience.
at an amount less than the amount advanced.
The underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance Q Share capital sheet date.
The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts.
In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are 1 Share issue costs used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, cases.

Claims liabilities net of tax, from the proceeds.
2 Dividends 3 Liability adequacy test Dividends paid on the Groups ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.
At each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business.
In performing these tests current best estimates of discounted future contractual 3 Treasury shares cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used.

The preparation of the Groups financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as insurance contracts making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment.

The allowance for impairment losses on loans and receivables is managements best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet O Foreign currency translation date.
In determining the required level of impairment provisions, the Group uses the output from various statistical models.
Management judgement is Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which required to assess the robustness of the outputs from these models and, where necessary, make appropriate adjustments.
Impairment allowances are the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and made up of two components, those determined individually and those determined collectively.
Individual impairment allowances are generally established against the Groups commercial lending portfolios.
The determination of individual Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
In addition, a collective unidentified impairment provision is made for loan losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
This provision is sensitive to changes in the time between the loss event and the date the impairment is specifically identified.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a This period is known as the loss emergence period.
Management use a significant level of judgement when determining the collective unidentified separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated impairment provision, including the assessment of the level of overall risk existing within particular sectors and the impact of the low interest rate as hedges of such investments see F 3 above.

Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
Payment protection insurance and other regulatory provisions The Group recognises provisions in respect of vacant leasehold property where the unavoidable costs of the present obligations exceed anticipated At 31 December 2015, the Group carried provisions of 4,463 million 2014: 3,378 million against the cost of making redress payments to customers rental income.

NOTE 3: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of the Groups financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The significant judgements made by management in applying the Groups accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements, which together are deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, are as follows.

The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and in particular is sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions, including the interdependency of house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers behaviour, and consumer bankruptcy trends.
It is, however, inherently difficult to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
Given the relative size of the mortgage portfolio, a key variable is house prices which determine the collateral value supporting loans in such portfolios.
The value of this collateral is estimated by applying changes in house price indices to the original assessed value of the property.
If average house prices were ten per cent lower than those estimated at 31 December 2015, the impairment charge would increase by approximately 228 million in respect of UK mortgages.
This period is known as the loss emergence period.
Management use a significant level of judgement when determining the collective unidentified impairment provision, including the assessment of the level of overall risk existing within particular sectors and the impact of the low interest rate environment on loss emergence periods.

The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of in-force business assets at 31 December 2015 are set out in note 25.
The value of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes liabilities requires management to make a number of assumptions.
The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows and the expected lifetime of the schemes members.
The discount rate is At 31 December 2015, the Group carried total liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of 80,294 million 2014:86,918 million.
The methodology used to value these liabilities is described in note 33.
Elements of the liability valuations require assumptions to required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds with the currency and term of the corporate bonds consistent with the defined benefit pension schemes obligations.
The average duration of the schemes obligations is approximately be made about future investment returns, future mortality rates and future policyholder behaviour and are subject to significant management judgement and estimation uncertainty.
The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of these liabilities are set out in note 33.
The market for bonds with a 20 year duration is illiquid and, as a result, significant management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate.

NOTE 4: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Lloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locationsoverseas.
The Groups operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures.
The Group Executive Committee reviews the Groups internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
GEC considers interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net.
The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided, by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.
The segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis, the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
The effects of asset sales, volatile items, liability management, simplification costs, TSB build and dual running costs, regulatory provisions, certain past service pension credits or charges, the amortisation of purchased intangible assets and the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments are excluded in arriving at underlyingprofit.
Following the disposal of TSB in 2015, the Groups activities are organised into four financial reporting segments: Retail: Commercial Banking: Consumer Finance and Insurance.
Retail offers a broad range of financial service products, including current accounts, savings, personal loans and mortgages, to UK retail customers, incorporating wealth and small business customers.
It is also a distributor of insurance, protection and credit cards and a range of long-term savings and investment products.
Commercial Banking is client led, focusing on SME, Mid Markets, Global Corporates and Financial Institution clients providing products across Lending, Global Transaction Banking, Financial Markets and Debt Capital Markets and private equity financing through Lloyds Development Capital.
Consumer Finance comprises the Groups consumer and corporate Credit Card businesses, along with the Black Horse motor financing and LexAutolease car leasing businesses in Asset Finance.
Insurance is a core part of Lloyds Banking Group and is focused on five key markets: Corporate Pensions, Protection, Retirement, Bulk Annuities and Home Insurance, to enable customers to protect themselves today and prepare for a secure financial future.
Other includes certain assets previously reported as outside of the Groups risk appetite and the results and gains on sale relating to businesses disposed in 2013 and 2014.
Other also includes income and expenditure not recharged to divisions, including the costs of certain central and head office functions and the costs of managing the Groups technology platforms, branch and head office property estate, operations including payments, banking operations and collections and sourcing, the costs of which arepredominantly recharged to the other divisions.
Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.
199 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 4: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS continued For the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central group segment where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships.
Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central group segment.
This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which is managed centrally and reported within Other.

The effect of this change was to reduce the Groups retirement benefit obligations recognised on the balance sheet by 843million with a corresponding curtailment gain recognised in the income statement.
This has been partly offset by a charge of 21million following changes to pension arrangements for staff within the TSB business.
In 2013, the Group agreed certain changes to early retirement and commutation factors in two of its principal defined benefit pension schemes, resulting in a curtailment cost of 104million recognised in the Groups income statement in the year ended 31December 2013.

Such assignments typically relate to the provision of advice on tax issues, assistance in transactions involving the acquisition and disposal of businesses and accounting advice.
The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including that fees for audit and non-audit services are approved in advance.
This approval can be obtained either on an individual engagement basis or, for certain types of non-audit services, particularly those of a recurring nature, through the approval of a fee cap covering all engagements of that type provided the fee is below that cap.
All statutory audit work as well as non-audit assignments where the fee is expected to exceed the relevant fee cap must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis.
On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to theauditors for such pre-approved services.
During the year, the auditors also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following: 2015 2014 2013 m m m Audits of Group pension schemes 0.3 0.3 0.3 Audits of the unconsolidated Open Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group 0.4 0.4 0.5 Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers 3.1 5.0 6.5 Acquisition due diligence and other work performed in respect of potential venture capital investments 1.2 1.0 2.1 NOTE 12: IMPAIRMENT 2015 2014 2013 m m m Impairment losses on loans and receivables: Loans and advances to customers 443 735 2,725 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 2 2 1 Total impairment losses on loans and receivables note 21 441 737 2,726 Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets 4 5 15 Other credit risk provisions 55 10 Total impairment charged to the income statement 390 752 2,741 208 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 13: TAXATION A Analysis of tax charge for the year 2015 2014 2013 m m m UK corporation tax: Current tax on profit for the year 485 162 226 Adjustments in respect of prior years 90 213 205 575 51 431 Foreign tax: Current tax on profit for the year 24 39 60 Adjustments in respect of prior years 27 3 26 3 36 34 Current tax charge credit 572 15 465 Deferred tax note 38 : Origination and reversal of temporary differences 185 72 434 Due to change in UK corporation tax rate 27 24 594 Adjustments in respect of prior years 96 182 276 116 278 752 Tax charge 688 263 1,217 The charge for tax on the profit for 2015 is based on a UK corporation tax rate of 20.25per cent 2014: 21.5percent: 2013: 23.25percent.

Cash deposits of 8,383million 2014: 11,251million held by the Group are restricted in use to repayment of the debt securities issued by the structured entities, the term advances relating to covered bonds and other legal obligations.
Additionally, the Group had certain contractual arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities.
At 31December 2015 these obligations had not been triggered: the maximum exposure under these facilities was 381million 2014:392million.
The Group has a number of covered bond programmes, for which Limited Liability Partnerships have been established to ring-fence asset pools and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group.
At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility.
From time-to-time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes.
The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.
The Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets.
The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes.
Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit impaired.
The Group has not voluntarily offered to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2015 2014:none.
Such repurchases are made in order to ensure that the expected maturity dates of the notes issued from these programmes are met.

This will also contain changes in the other assets and liabilities, including the effects of changes in assumptions used to value the liabilities, of the relevant businesses.
The presentation of economic variance includes the impact of financial market conditions being different at the end of the reporting period from those included in assumptions used to calculate newand existing businessreturns.
The principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below: Economic assumptions Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
In practice, to achieve thesame result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the certainty equivalent approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate.
The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business where an illiquidity premium is included, see below.
A market-consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date.
Further information on options and guarantees can be found in note 33.
The liabilities in respect of the Groups UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and illiquid loan assets.
The value of the in-force business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets.
The determination of the market premium for illiquidity reflects actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data, and has been checked for consistency with the capital markets.
The illiquidity premium is estimated to be in the range of 85 to 144 basis points at 31December 2015 2014: 120basispoints.
The risk-free rate is derived from the relevant swap curve with a deduction for credit risk.
218 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 25: VALUE OF IN-FORCE BUSINESS continued The table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31December: 2015 2014 % % 1 Risk-free rate value of in-force non-annuity business 0.00 to 4.20 0.00 to 3.27 1 Risk-free rate value of in-force annuity business 0.85 to 5.64 1.02 to 4.56 1 Risk-free rate financial options and guarantees 0.00 to 2.54 0.29 to 2.20 Retail price inflation 3.27 3.26 Expense inflation 3.65 3.92 1 All risk-free rates are quoted as the range of rates implied by the relevant swap curve.
Non-market risk An allowance for non-market risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for non-market risk is required.
However, in the case ofoperational risk, reinsurer default and the with-profit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.
Non-economic assumptions Future mortality, morbidity, expenses, lapse and paid-up rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on managements view of future experience.
Further information on these assumptions is given in note 33 and the effect of changes in key assumptions is given in note 34.

The movement in life insurance contract and participating investment contract liabilities over the year can be analysed as follows: The realistic assessment is carried out using a stochastic simulation model which values liabilities on a market-consistent basis.
The calculation of realistic Participating liabilities uses best estimate assumptions for mortality, persistency rates and expenses.
These are calculated in a similar manner to those used for the Insurance investment value of in-force business as discussed in note25.

Mortality The mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.
Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques.
As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.
223 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 33: LIABILITIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS continued The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a best estimate view of what persistency will be.
In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
iv Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds The most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.
For those policies written in Scottish Widows pre-demutualisation containing potentially valuable options and guarantees, under the terms of the Scheme a separate memorandum account was set up, within the With-Profit Fund originally held in Scottish Widows plc and subsequently transferred into Scottish Widows Limited, called the Additional Account which is available, inter alia, to meet any additional costs of providing guaranteed benefits in respect of those policies.
The Additional Account had a value at 31 December 2015 of 2.5 billion 2014: 2.6 billion.
The eventual cost of providing benefits on policies written both pre and post demutualisation is dependent upon a large number of variables, including future interest rates and equity values, demographic factors, such as mortality, and the proportion of policyholders who seek to exercise their options.
The ultimate cost will therefore not be known for many years.
As noted above, under the realistic capital regime of the PRA, the liabilities of the With-Profit Funds are valued using a market-consistent stochastic simulation model which places a value on the options and guarantees which captures both their intrinsic value and their time value.
The most significant economic assumptions included in the model are risk-free yield and investment volatility.
Non-profit fund liabilities i Business description The Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds.
Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.
Unit-linked business This includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.
Life insurance The policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts.
Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.
Annuities The policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities The non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and consistent with the approach required by regulatory rules.
The methods used involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
iii Assumptions Generally, assumptions used to value non-profit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation.
Thismargin for adverse deviation is based on managements judgement and reflects managements views on the inherent level of uncertainty.
Thekey assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are: Interest rates The rates used are derived in accordance with the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies.
These limit the rates of interest that can be used byreference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuation date.
Margins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates.
These are derived from the limits in the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.
Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates are allowed for on some non-profit fund contracts.
The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.
Maintenance expenses Allowance is made for future policy costs explicitly.
Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation.
Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.
Key changes in assumptions A detailed review of the Groups assumptions in 2015 resulted in the following key impacts on profit before tax: Change in persistency assumptions 196 million decrease.
Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality rates 224 million increase.
Change in expenses assumptions 70 million increase.
These amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.

In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are income for life e. g. annuities.

the relevant occupational pension scheme.
The key assumptions affecting the ultimate value of the guarantee are future salary growth, gilt yields at retirement, annuitant mortality at retirement, marital status at retirement and future investment returns.
There is currently a provision, calculated on a iv Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds deterministic basis, of 68 million 2014: 61 million in respect of those guarantees.
The most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.

All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the defined benefit sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Schemes Nos 1 and 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme.
These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a percentage of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of service: the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31December 2015 is generally 55 although certain categories of member are deemed to have a contractual right to retire at50.
The Group operates a number of funded and unfunded pension arrangements, the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK.
All schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law by the trustees.
All UK schemes are funded in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation exercise is carried out for each scheme at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities Technical Provisions are measured using prudent assumptions, if a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review.
The outcome of this valuation process, including agreement of any recovery plans, is agreed between the Group and the scheme Trustee.
The Group has not provided for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be available to the Group.
The Groups overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.
The latest full valuations of the three main schemes were carried out as at 30June 2014: the results have been updated to 31December 2015 by qualified independent actuaries.
The last full valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31December 2015 by qualified independent actuaries.

The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31December 2015 is assumed to live for, on average, 28.1 years for a male and 30.4 years for a female.
In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members.
It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now.
This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve.
To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. iii Amount timing and uncertainty of future cash flows Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes Whilst the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below: Inflation rate risk: the majority of the plans benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be partially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings.
Longevity risk: The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Investment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets.
If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit.
Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Groups income statement.
The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made.
The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.
230 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 37: RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Sensitivity analysis The effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the Groups income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme liability, for the Groups three most significant schemes, is set out below.
The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility.
The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result.
It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice.
Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.
Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions Increase decrease Increase decrease in the in the income net defined benefit pension statement charge scheme liability 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m 1 Inflation including pension increases : Increase of 0.1percent 17 18 363 383 Decrease of 0.1percent 16 16 346 362 2 Discount rate: Increase of 0.1percent 29 30 605 611 Decrease of 0.1percent 30 29 621 623 Expected life expectancy of members: Increase of one year 43 34 952 750 Decrease of one year 41 32 927 738 1 At 31December2015, the assumed rate of RPI inflation is 2.99percent and CPI inflation 1.99 per cent 2014: RPI 2.95percent and CPI 1.95 per cent.
2 At 31December2015, the assumed discount rate is 3.87percent 2014: 3.67percent.
Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions The sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the Groups three most significant schemes which account for over 90percent of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
Whilst differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Groups pension arrangements mean they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as awhole.
The inflation assumption sensitivity applies to both the assumed rate of increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI and the Retail Prices Index RPI, and include the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement.
These pension increases are linked to inflation either CPI or RPI subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.
The sensitivity analysis including the inflation sensitivity does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2April2014.
The life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme.
Whilst this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.
Asset-liability matching strategies The main schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities.
The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Specific asset-liability matching strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.
A significant goal of the asset-liability matching strategies adopted by Group schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation.
In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements.
These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities, and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile.
The asset-liability matching strategy currently mitigates substantially all of the interest rate and inflation rate volatility of the liabilities.

Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections ofthe Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No.
During the year ended 31December 2015 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 233million 2014:252million: 2013:255million, representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each schemes rules.
Other post-retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits and concessionary mortgages to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants.
The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees and their dependants who retired prior to 1January 1996.
The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.
For the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31December 2014 by qualified independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.59 percent 2014: 6.55percent.

The Act reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 19 per cent from 1April 2017 and 18 per cent from 1 April 2020.
In addition, the Government announced that from 1 January 2016 banking profits will be subject to an additional surcharge of 8 per cent.
The change in the main rate of corporation tax from 20 per cent to 18 per cent, and the additional surcharge of 8 per cent, have resulted in a movement in the Groups net deferred tax asset at 31 December 2015 of 123 million, comprising the 27 million charge included in the income statement and a 96 million charge included in equity.
Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Group companies have recognised deferred tax assets of 4,890 million 2014:5,758million in relation to trading tax losses carried forward.
After reviews of medium-term profit forecasts, the Group considers that there will be sufficient profits in the future against which these losses will beoffset see note 3.
Deferred tax assets of 140million 2014:190million have not been recognised in respect of capital losses carried forward as there are no predicted future capital profits.
Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets of 893million 2014: 614million have not been recognised in respect of trading losses carried forward, mainly in certain overseas companies and in respect of other temporary differences in the insurance businesses.
Trading losses can be carried forward indefinitely, except for losses in the USA which expire after 20 years.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unrelieved foreign tax carried forward at 31December 2015 of 76million 2014:117million, as there are no predicted future taxable profits against which the unrelieved foreign tax credits can be utilised.
These tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.

Payment protection insurance The Group increased the provision for PPI costs by a further 4,000 million in 2015, bringing the total amount provided to 16,025 million.
This included an additional 2,600 million in the second half of 2015, largely to reflect the impact of our interpretation of the proposals contained within the Financial Conduct Authoritys FCA consultation paper regarding a potential time bar and the Plevin case.
As at 31 December 2015, 3,458 million or 22per cent of the total provision, remained unutilised with 2,950 million relating to reactive complaints and associated administration costs.
The volume of reactive PPI complaints has continued to fall, with an 8 per cent reduction in 2015 compared with 2014, to approximately 8,000 complaints per week.
Whilst direct customer complaint levels fell 30 per cent year-on-year, those from Claims Management Companies CMCs have remained broadly stable and as a result, CMCs now account for over 70 per cent of complaints.
On 26 November 2015, the FCA published a consultation paper CP15 39: Rules and guidance on payment protection insurance complaints proposing i the introduction of a deadline by which consumers would need to make their PPI complaints including an FCA led communications campaign, and ii rules and guidance about how firms should handle PPI complaints in light of the Supreme Courts decision in Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited [2014] UKSC 61 Plevin.
Based on recent trends, and in light of the proposals from the FCA, the Group now expects a higher level of complaints than previously assumed including those related to Plevin.
As a result the Group has increased the total expected reactive complaint volumes to 4.7 million with approximately 1.3 million still expected to be received.
This is equivalent to approximately 10,000 net complaints per week on average through to the proposed time bar of mid 2018.
Monthly complaints trends could vary significantly throughout this period, given they are likely to be impacted by a number of factors including the potential impact of the FCAs proposed communication campaign as well as changes in the regulation of CMCs.
The provision includes an estimate to cover redress that would be payable under the FCAs proposed new rules and guidance in light of Plevin.
During the year the scope has been extended by 0.5 million to 1.7 million cases relating largely to previously redressed cases, in addition to which, higher overturn rates and average redress have been experienced.
At the end of January 2016, 77 per cent of cases had been reviewed and 77per cent of all cash payments made.
The Group has completed its Past Business Review PBR where it has been identified that there was a risk of potential mis-sale for certain customers, albeit active monitoring continues.
No further change has been made to the amount provided.
The Group expects to maintain the PPI operation on its current scale for longer than previously anticipated given the update to volume related assumptions and the re-review of previously handled cases continuing into the first quarter of 2016.
The estimate for administrative expenses, which comprise complaint handling costs and costs arising from cases subsequently referred to the FOS, is included in the provision increase outlined above.
Sensitivities The Group estimates that it has sold approximately 16 million policies since 2000.
These include policies that were not mis-sold.
Since the commencement of the PPI redress programme in 2011 the Group estimates that it has contacted, settled or provided for almost 49 per cent of the policies sold since 2000, covering both customer-initiated complaints and actual and PBR mailings undertaken by the Group.

However, the Group is a member of Visa and MasterCard and other card schemes.
The European Commission continues to pursue certain competition investigations into MasterCard and Visa probing, amongst other things, MIFs paid in respect of cards issued outside the EEA: Litigation continues in the English Courts against both Visa and MasterCard.
This litigation has been brought by several retailers who are seeking damages for allegedly overpaid MIFs.
From publicly available information, it is understood these damages claims are running to different timescales with respect to the litigation process, and their outcome remains uncertain.
It is also possible that new claims may be issued.

As set out in the announcement by the Group on 2 November, the Groups share of the sale proceeds will comprise upfront consideration of cash the amount of which remains subject to adjustment prior to completion and preferred stock.
The preferred stock will be convertible into Class A Common Stock of Visa Inc or its equivalent upon occurrence of certain events.
As part of this transaction, the Group and certain other UK banks also entered into a Loss Sharing Agreement LSA with Visa Inc, which clarifies how liabilities will be allocated between the parties should the litigation referred to above result in Visa Inc being liable for damages payable by Visa Europe.
Visa Inc may only have recourse to the LSA once 1 billion of damages have been applied to the value of the UK preferred stock received by Visa UK members including the Group as part of the consideration to the transaction.
The value of the preferred stock will be reduced by making a downward adjustment to the conversion rate in an amount equal to any covered losses.
The maximum amount of liability to which the Group may be subject under the LSA is capped at the cash consideration to be received by the Group.
Visa Inc may also have recourse to a general indemnity, currently in place under Visa Europes Operating Regulations, for damages claims concerning inter or intra-regional MIF setting activities.

Certain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have also been named as defendants in private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Sterling LIBOR.
The lawsuits, which contain broadly similar allegations, allege violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and the Commodity Exchange Act, as well as various state statutes and common law doctrines.
Certain of the plaintiffs claims, including those asserted under US anti-trust laws, have been dismissed by the US Federal Court for Southern District of New York the District Court.
That courts dismissal of plaintiffs anti-trust claims has been appealed to the New York Federal Court of Appeal.
The OTC and Exchange Based plaintiffs claims were dismissed in November 2015 for lack of personal jurisdiction against the Group.

It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
The Group manages valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on a net basis: the Group determines their fair values on the basis of their net exposures.
In all other cases, fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are determined on the basis of their gross exposures.
The carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks, notes in circulation and liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financialposition.
Fair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
These items include intangible assets, such as the value of the Groups branch network, the long-term relationships with depositors and credit card relationships: premises and equipment: and shareholders equity.
These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that the fair value information presented does not represent the underlying value of the Group.
Valuation control framework The key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification.
These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.
Model validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models.
In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted preand post-trading.
Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Groups systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade life cycle.
Post-trade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external sources.
Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value.
The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum.
Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management.
The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.
Formal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, over-the-counter options and the Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA reserve.
Valuation of financial assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.
Level 1 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.
Level 2 Level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data.
Examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.
Level 3 Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Such instruments would include the Groups venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows.
Certain of the Groups asset-backed securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3.
Transfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instruments valuation become market observable after previously having been non-market observable.
In the case of asset-backed securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available.
Conversely transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.

The fair value of these assets is determined using discounted cash flow techniques.
The discount rates are derived from observable repo curves specific to the type of security purchased under the reverse repurchase agreement.
Debt securities Debt securities measured at fair value and classified as level2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.
Where there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation.
Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input.
Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise certain collateralised loan obligations and collateralised debt obligations.
Equity investments Unlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Groups valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Depending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.
A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The particular multiple selected being appropriate for the type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple.
Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing ofcomparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple.
Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return.
Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple.
For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, ifnecessary, to align valuation techniques with the Groups valuation policy.
Unlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using thirdparty valuations.
Management take account of any pertinent information, such asrecent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary.

The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2015, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of 7,878million 2014: 6,739million of the Groups debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a gain of 114million 2014: gain of 33million.

C Derivatives All of the Groups derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2015, such assets totalled 29,467million 31December 2014:36,128million and liabilities totalled 26,301million 31December 2014: 33,187million.
The table below analyses these derivative balances by valuation methodology level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 251.
There were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the year.

The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include: Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models: the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.
Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources.
Credit derivatives which are valued using standard models with observable inputs, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap CDS curves.
Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities: option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service.
For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data: where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-the-money positions using a market standard consensus pricing service.
Complex interest rate and foreign exchange products where there is significant dispersion of consensus pricing or where implied funding costs are material and unobservable are classified as level 3.
Where credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on asset-backed securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis asset-backed security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying asset-backed security.
The Groups level 3 derivative assets include 545million 2014: 646million in respect of the value of the embedded equity conversion feature of the Enhanced Capital Notes issued in December 2009.
The embedded equity conversion feature is valued by comparing the market price of the Enhanced Capital Notes with the market price of similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The latter is calculated by discounting the expected Enhanced Capital Note cash flows in the absence of a conversion using prevailing market yields for similar capital securities without the conversion feature.
The market price of the Enhanced Capital Notes was calculated with reference to multiple broker quotes.
The table below analyses movements in level 3 derivative assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
Following changes in the valuation methodology in 2015, uncollateralised inflation swaps are considered not to have significant unobservable inputs and have been transferred from level 3 to level 2.

i Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments, excluding monoline counterparties The following table summarises the movement on this valuation adjustment account during 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 m m At 1 January 608 498 Income statement credit charge 38 95 Transfers 28 15 At 31 December 598 608 Represented by: 2015 2014 m m Credit Valuation Adjustment 511 568 Debit Valuation Adjustment 78 85 Funding Valuation Adjustment 165 125 598 608 Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments CVA and DVA are applied to the Groups over-the-counter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to standard interbank collateral arrangements.
These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.
A CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure asset.
A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure liability.
These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Groups own credit spread respectively.
The CVA is sensitive to: the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset: and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness.
In circumstances where exposures to a counterparty become impaired, any associated derivative valuation adjustment is transferred and assessed for specific loss alongside other non-derivative assets and liabilities that the counterparty may have with the Group.
Market Credit Default Swap CDS spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties.
For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used.
The Loss Given Default LGD is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.
The combination of a one notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a tenpercent increase in LGD increases the CVA by 99million.
Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes.
For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis in total contributing 2million of the overall CVA balance at 31 December 2015.
The DVA is sensitive to: the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability: and the Groups own CDS spread.
A onepercent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of 122million to 200million.
The risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates.
Due to the nature of the Groups business the CVA DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise.
Aonepercent rise in interest rates would lead to a 200million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to 233million.
The CVA model used by theGroup does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.
The Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative positions.
This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds.
A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by approximately 30million.
ii Market liquidity The Group includes mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Groups trading positions within a timeframe that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.
At 31December2015, the Groups derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of 76million 2014: 74million.

258 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 50: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Unobservable inputs Significant unobservable inputs affecting the valuation of debt securities, unlisted equity investments and derivatives are as follows: Interest rates and inflation rates are referenced in some derivatives where the payoff that the holder of the derivative receives depends on the behaviour of those underlying references through time.
Credit spreads represent the premium above the benchmark reference instrument required to compensate for lower credit quality: higher spreads lead to a lower fair value.
Volatility parameters represent key attributes of option behaviour: higher volatilities typically denote a wider range of possible outcomes.
Earnings multiples are used to value certain unlisted equity investments: a higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value.
Reasonably possible alternative assumptions Valuation techniques applied to many of the Groups level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent.
The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.
Debt securities Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups structured credit investment by flexing creditspreads.
Derivatives Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups derivative portfolios as follows: In respect of the embedded equity conversion feature of the Enhanced Capital Notes, the sensitivity was based on the absolute difference betweenthe actual price of the enhanced capital note and the closest, alternative broker quote available plus the impact of applying a 10 bps increase decrease in the market yield used to derive a market price for similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The effect of interdependency of the assumptions is not material to the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions to the valuations of derivative financial instruments.
Uncollateralised inflation swaps are valued using appropriate discount spreads for such transactions.
These spreads are not generally observable for longer maturities.
The reasonably possible alternative valuations reflect flexing of the spreads for the differing maturities to alternative values of between 55 bps and 107 bps 2014: 3bps and 167bps.
Swaptions are priced using industry standard option pricing models.
Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities.
To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of 1percent to 63percent 2014: 4percent and 120percent.
Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships The valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered: for valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple: the discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations: and in line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investments portfolios.

The carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.
To determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics.
A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending: these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows.
For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions.
Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period.
The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes incredit risk.
No adjustment is made to put it in place by the Group to manage its interest rate exposure.
Loans and advances to banks The carrying value of short dated loans and advances to banks is assumed to be their fair value.
The fair value of loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.
Debt securities The fair values of debt securities, which were previously within assets held for trading and were reclassified to loans and receivables, are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.
Reverse repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.

The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Debt securities in issue The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.
Fair value for other debt securities is calculated based on quoted market prices where available.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Groups own credit spread.
Subordinated liabilities The fair value of subordinated liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices where available or by reference to quoted market prices of similar instruments.
Subordinated liabilities are classified as level 2, since the inputs used to determine their fair value are largely observable.
Repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short term nature of these instruments.
5 Reclassification of financial assets In 2015 the Group reviewed its approach to managing a portfolio of government securities held as a separately identifiable component of the Groups liquidity portfolio.
Given the long-term nature of this portfolio, the Group concluded that certain of these securities will be able to be held until they reach maturity.
Consequently, on 1May 2015, government securities with a fair value of 19,938million were reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to held-to-maturity investments reflecting the Groups positive intent and ability to hold them until maturity.
No financial assets were reclassified in 2014.

In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.
As set out in note 19, included within loans and receivables are loans transferred under the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes.
As the Group retains all of a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Assets transferred into the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group whilst the assets are within the programmes.
However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programmes requirements.
In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retainednotes.
The table below sets out the carrying values of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities.
For repurchase and securities lending transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets.
For securitisation programmes, the associated liabilities represent the external notes in issue note 32.
Except as otherwise noted below, none of the liabilities shown in the table below have recourse only to the transferred assets.

The primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: credit risk: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk: liquidity risk: capital risk: and insurance risk.
Information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks and capital can be found on pages 111 to 169.
The following additional disclosures, which provide quantitative information about the risks within financial instruments held or issued by the Group, should be read in conjunction with that earlier information.
Market risk Interest rate risk In the Groups retail banking business interest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities.
Liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Groups discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the Bank of Englands base rate.
Many banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements: there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities.
However, a significant proportion ofthe Groups lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed for periods of upto five years orlonger.
The Group establishes two types of hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk: fair value hedges and cash flow hedges.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt.
At 31December 2015 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was 121,063million 2014:115,394million with a net fair value asset of 848million 2014: asset of 1,511million note 16.
The losses on the hedging instruments were 618million 2014:losses of 2,866million.
The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were 511million 2014:gains of 2,720million.
In addition the Group has cash flow hedges which are primarily used to hedge the variability in the cost of funding within the commercial business.
The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31December 2015 was 460,829million 2014:518,746million with a net fair value liability of 718million 2014: liability of 930million note16.
In 2015, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a gain of 3million 2014: gain of 56million.
Currency risk The corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are transferred to the trading area where they are monitored and controlled.
The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London.
Risk arises from the Groups investments in its overseas operations.
The Groups structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches.
The Group hedges part of the currency translation risk of the net investment in certain foreign operations using currency borrowings.
In 2015, an ineffectiveness gain of 5million before tax and 4million after tax 2014: ineffectiveness loss of 1million before and after tax was recognised in the income statement arising from netinvestment hedges.

Information about the Groups exposure to credit risk, credit risk management, measurement and mitigation can be found on pages 121 to 143.
Maximum credit exposure The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below.
No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With Profits funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.
2 Offset items comprise deposit amounts available for offset and amounts available for offset under master netting arrangements that do not meet the criteria under IAS 32 to enable loans and advances and derivative assets respectively to be presented net of these balances in the financial statements.
4 Includes assets within the Groups unit-linked funds for which credit risk is borne by the policyholders and assets within the Groups With-Profits funds for which credit risk is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back related contract liabilities.
Concentrations of exposure The Groups management of concentration risk includes single name, industry sector and country limits as well as controls over the Groups overall exposure to certain products.
Further information on the Groups management of this risk is included within Credit risk mitigation, Risk management on page 122.
At 31 December 2015 the most significant concentrations of exposure were in mortgages comprising 68 percent of total loans and advances to customers and to financial, business and other services comprising 9percent of the total.
For further information on concentrations of the Groups loans, refer to note 18.
Following the continuing reduction in the Groups non-UK activities, an analysis of credit risk exposures by geographical region has not been provided.

Credit quality of assets Loans and receivables The disclosures in the table below and those on pages 268 and 269 are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition date on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The remaining acquisition-related fair value adjustments in respect of this lending are therefore identified separately in this table.
The analysis of lending between retail and commercial has been prepared based upon the type of exposure and not the business segment in which the exposure is recorded.
Included within retail are exposures to personal customers and small businesses, whilst included within commercial are exposures to corporate customers and other large institutions.

Commercial lending has been classified using internal probability of default rating models mapped so that they are comparable to external credit ratings.
Good quality lending comprises the lower assessed default probabilities, with other classifications reflecting progressively higher default risk.
Classifications of retail lending incorporate expected recovery levels for mortgages, as well as probabilities of default assessed using internal rating models.
Further information about the Groups internal probabilities of default rating models can be found on page 121.

Credit risk in respect of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held within the Groups unit-linked funds is borne by the policyholders and credit risk in respect of with-profits funds is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.
270 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 53: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Derivative assets An analysis of derivative assets is given in note16.
The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the Groups maximum credit risk relating to derivative assets of 10,001million 2014:14,199million, cash collateral of 3,228million 2014:3,651million was held and a further 94million was due from OECD banks 2014:2,043million.
2 Other comprises sub-investment grade 2015: 1,418million: 2014: 1,896 million and not rated 2015: 632million: 2014: 3,473 million.
Financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments Financial guarantees represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customers obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do so.
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit.
The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less: most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.
D. Collateral held as security for financial assets A general description of collateral held as security in respect of financial instruments is provided on page 123.
The Group holds collateral against loans and receivables and irrevocable loan commitments: qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below.
Collateral held as security for trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.
Loans and receivables The disclosures below are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition, such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below.
The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising asset-backed securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and advances to banks There were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying value of 963million 2014:1,899million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 1,009million 2014:1,886million.
These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.
Loans and advances to customers Retail lending Mortgages An analysis by loan-to-value ratio of the Groups residential mortgage lending is provided below.
The value of collateral used in determining the loan-to-value ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowance for indexation error and dilapidations.
At 31 December 2015, impaired non-mortgage lending amounted to 1,153million, net of an impairment allowance of 448million 2014: 1,470million, net of an impairment allowance of 577million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of this lending was 107million 2014: 110million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation and the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending amounted to 39,279million 2014: 38,560million.
Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.
The Group credit risk disclosures for unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending report assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.
The value of collateral is reassessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower.
Unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending, including any associated collateral, is managed on a customer-by-customer basis rather than a portfolio basis.
No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.
Commercial lending Reverse repurchase transactions At 31 December 2014 there were reverse repurchase agreements which were accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 5,148million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 5,155million, all of which the Group was able to repledge.
Included in these amounts were collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of reverse repurchase agreements amounting to 35million.
There were no such transactions in 2015.
Impaired secured lending The value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness re-assessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower: this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and managements strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.
At 31 December 2015, impaired secured commercial lending amounted to 1,245million, net of an impairment allowance of 577million 2014:2,539million, net of an impairment allowance of 3,799million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was 1,367million 2014:2,517million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation.
For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Impaired secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services: transport, distribution and hotels: and construction industries.
Unimpaired secured lending Unimpaired secured commercial lending amounted to 51,298million 2014:57,647million.
For unimpaired secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.
Unimpaired secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis.
On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for impaired lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis.
No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.
Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss excluding equity shares Included in trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 33,174million 2014:36,725million.
Collateral is held with a fair value of 36,493million 2014:42,858million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
In addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to 58,621million 2014:33,721million.
Of this amount, 29,859million 2014:32,686million had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Groups own transactions.
Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquidsecurities.
In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of 10,001million 2014:14,199million, cash collateral of 3,228million 2014:3,651million was held.
Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies At 31 December 2015, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of 65,719million 2014: 57,711million.
Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on 9,551 million 2014:8,673million of these balances.
Collateral repossessed During the year, 203million of collateral was repossessed 2014: 828million, consisting primarily of residential property.
In respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness.
Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations.
In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as 272 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 53: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued collateral against commercial lending.
In such cases, the assets are carried on the Groups balance sheet and are classified according to the Groups accounting policies.
E. Collateral pledged as security The Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.
Repurchase transactions Deposits from banks Included in deposits from banks are deposits held as collateral for facilities granted, with a carrying value of 7,061million 2014: 1,075million and a fair value of 6,707million 2014: 1,075million.
Customer deposits Customer deposits included no deposits held as collateral for facilities granted 2014:nil.
Collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of repurchase agreements amounted to 5million 2014:6million.
Trading and other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss The fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowing, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was 44,655million 2014: 56,696million.
Securities lending transactions The following on balance sheet financial assets have been lent to counterparties under securities lending transactions: 2015 2014 m m Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 6,478 9,955 Loans and advances to customers 1,491 1,393 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 88 Available-for-sale financial assets 4,247 8,363 12,216 19,799 Securitisations and covered bonds In addition to the assets detailed above, the Group also holds assets that are encumbered through the Groups asset-backed conduits and its securitisation and covered bond programmes.
Further details of these assets are provided in notes 19 and 20.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity.
The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA.
The Groups liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.
273 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 53: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.
The Groups assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups liquidity position.
In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice.
However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.
274 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 53: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued The table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
The majority ofthe Groups financial guarantee contracts are callable on demand, were the guaranteed party to fail to meet its obligations.
It is, however, expected that most guarantees will expire unused.
The contractual nominal amounts of these guarantees totalled 7,165million at 31December 2015 2014: 7,161million with 4,014million expiring within one year: 942million between one and three years: 1,182million between three and five years: and 1,027million over five years 2014: 4,133million expiring within one year: 1,823million between one and three years: 674million between three and five years: and 531million over five years.
The majority of the Groups non-participating investment contract liabilities are unit-linked.
These unit-linked products are invested in accordance with unit fund mandates.
Clauses are included in policyholder contracts to permit the deferral of sales, where necessary, so that linked assets can be realised without being a forced seller.
The principal amount for undated subordinated liabilities with no redemption option is included within the over five years column: interest of approximately 39 million 2014: 80million per annum which is payable in respect of those instruments for as long as they remain in issue is not included beyond five years.

A. Banco Sabadell and that it had entered into an irrevocable undertaking to accept Banco Sabadells recommended cash offer in respect of its remaining 40.01percent interest in TSB.
The offer by Banco Sabadell was conditional upon, amongst other things, regulatory approval.
The sale of the 9.99percent interest completed on 24 March 2015, reducing the Groups holding in TSB to 40.01percent: this sale led to a loss of control and the deconsolidation of TSB.
The Groups residual investment in 40.01percent of TSB was then recorded at fair value, as an asset held for sale.
The Group recognised a loss of 660million reflecting the net costs of the Transitional Service Agreement between Lloyds and TSB, the contribution to be provided by Lloyds to TSB in moving to alternative IT provision and the net result on sale of the 9.99percent interest and fair valuation of the residual investment.
The Group announced on 30 June 2015 that all relevant regulatory clearances for the sale of its remaining 40.01 per cent holding in TSB had been received and that the sale was therefore unconditional in allrespects: the proceeds were received on 10July2015.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held a 2,349 million interest in Cape Funding No.
1 PLC, a securitisation funding vehicle set up by TSB.
278 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTE 56: EVENTS SINCE THE BALANCE SHEET DATE In 2015, the Group participated in the UK-wide concurrent stress testing run by the Bank of England: the Enhanced Capital Notes ECNs in issue were not taken into account for the purposes of core capital in the PRA stress tests and the Group has determined that a Capital Disqualification Event CDE, as defined in the conditions of the ECNs, has occurred.
This determination was confirmed by a unanimous decision by the Court of Appeal on 10 December 2015 and on 29 January 2016 the Group announced the redemption of certain series of ECNs using the Regulatory Call Right.
The Group also launched tender offers for the remaining series of ECNs on 29 January 2016 and has announced that, subsequent to completion of such offers, it will redeem those ECNs not validly tendered using the Regulatory Call Right.
The offers and redemptions will be completed before the end of the first quarter, resulting in a net loss to the Group currently estimated to be approximately 700 million, principally comprising the write-off of the embedded equity conversion feature and premiums paid under the terms of the transaction.
The trustee of the ECNs has been granted leave by the Supreme Court to appeal the Court of Appeal decision.
In the event that the Supreme Court were to determine that a CDE had not occurred, the Group would compensate fairly the holders of the ECNs whose securities are redeemed using the Regulatory Call Right for losses suffered as a result of early redemption.
NOTE 57: FUTURE ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS The following pronouncements are not applicable for the year ending 31 December 2015 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
Save as disclosed below, the full impact of these accounting changes is being assessed by the Group.
As at 24 February 2016, these pronouncements are awaiting EU endorsement.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into one of three measurement categories, fair value through profit or loss, fair value through other comprehensive income and amortised cost, on the basis of the objectives of the entitys business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments.
These changes are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 9 also replaces the existing incurred loss impairment approach with an expected credit loss approach, resulting in earlier recognition of credit losses.
The IFRS 9 impairment model has three stages.
Entities are required to recognise a 12 month expected loss allowance on initial recognition stage 1 and a lifetime expected loss allowance when there has been a significant increase in credit risk stage 2.
The assessment of whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred is a key aspect of the IFRS 9 methodology and involves quantitative measures, such as forward looking probabilities of default, and qualitative factors and therefore requires considerable management judgement.
Stage 3 requires objective evidence of impairment which is similar to the guidance on incurred losses in IAS 39.
IFRS 9 requires the use of more forward looking information including reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.
The need to consider multiple economic scenarios and how they could impact the loss allowance is a very subjective feature of the IFRS 9 impairment model.
Loan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at fair value through profit or loss are also in scope.
These changes may result in a material increase in the Groups balance sheet provisions for credit losses although the extent of any increase will depend upon, amongst other things, the composition of the Groups lending portfolios and forecast economic conditions at the date of implementation.
The requirement to transfer assets between stages and to incorporate forward looking data into the expected credit loss calculation, including multiple economic scenarios, is likely to result in impairment charges being more volatile when compared to the current IAS 39 impairment model.
The IFRS 9 expected credit loss model differs from the regulatory models in a number of ways, for example stage 2 assets under IFRS 9 carry a lifetime expected loss amount whereas regulatory models generate 12 month expected losses for non defaulted loans.
In addition, different assets are in scope of each reporting base and therefore the size of the regulatory expected losses should not be taken as a proxy to the size of the loss allowance underIFRS 9.
In 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published finalised guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses.
The paper sets out supervisory guidance on how expected credit loss accounting models should interact with a banks credit risk practices.
The existing impairment processes, controls and governance will be reviewed and changed where necessary to reflect the increased demands of an expected credit loss impairment model.
The hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are more closely aligned with risk management practices and follow a more principle-based approach than IAS 39.
The accounting policy choice to continue with IAS39 hedge accounting is still being considered by the Group.
The Group has an established IFRS 9 programme to ensure a high quality implementation in compliance with the standard and regulatory guidance.
The programme involves Finance and Risk functions across the Group with Divisional and Group steering committees providing oversight.
The key responsibilities of the programme include defining IFRS 9 methodology and accounting policy, identifying data and system requirements, and establishing an appropriate operating model and governance framework.
The impairment workstreams have developed methodologies for many of the IFRS 9 requirements, although additional validation of these decisions will be on-going to reflect the uncertainty around regulatory and audit expectations.
Some risk model build has started and detailed plans, including resource needs, are in place.
We expect the majority of model build to be completed in 2016 to allow robust testing and the development of management information to take place in 2017.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Financial instruments, leases and insurance contracts are out of scope and so this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases On 13 January 2016 the IASB issued IFRS 16 to replace IAS 17 Leases.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a right of use asset and a liability for future payments arising from a lease contract.
Lessor accounting requirements remain aligned to the current approach under IAS 17.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IAS 12 Income Taxes In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows which require additional disclosure about an entitys financing activities and IAS 12 Income Taxes which clarify when a deferred tax asset should be recognised for unrealised losses.
These revised requirements, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
