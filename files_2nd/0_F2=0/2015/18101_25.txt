STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Forming Part of the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation Cineworld Group plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in jointly controlled entities.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK standards including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework: these are presented onpages 129 to 135.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial period are set out below.
Information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Chief Executive Officers Statement on pages 8 to 9 and the Risksand Uncertainties section on pages 22 to 28.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 29 to 32.
In addition Note21 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Going Concern At the period end the Group met its daytoday working capital requirements through its bank loan, which consisted of a term loanand a revolving facility see Note 16 to the financial statements.
As part of the combination with Cinema City, the Group entered into a fiveyear facility in January 2014 which was used to part finance the combination, repay the precombination facilities of both Cineworld and Cinema City and fund the general working capital requirements of the Group.
The facility included term loans of 165.0m and 132.0m and revolving credit facilities of 75.0m and 60.0m.
In June 2015, the first prepayments were made to the term loans, reducing the liabilities to 157.5m and 126.0m.
On 29 July 2015 Cineworld Group plc signed an amendment and extension to its existing banking facility which was effective immediately upon signing and extends the facility to June 2020.
As a result, the term loans were reduced from 157.5m and 126.0m to 130.0m and 63.0m.
The Group now has a single multicurrency revolving credit facility of 190.0m.
The facility remains subject to the existing two covenants: the ratio of EBITDA to net debt and the ratio of EBITDAR prerent EBITDA to net finance charges.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility for at least 12 months from the approval date of the financial statements, including compliance with the bank facility covenants.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis.
Measurement Convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classified as fair value through the income statement or as available for sale.
The financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial information from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Thefinancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 89 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Jointly Controlled Entities Equity Accounted Investees Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring the venturers unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments onbehalf of an investee.
Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equityaccounted investees are eliminated against the investment tothe extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, butonlytothe extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Use of non-GAAP Profit and Loss Measures The Group believes that along with operating profit, the following measures: EBITDA Adjusted profit before tax Adjusted profit after tax Provide additional guidance to the statutory measures of the performance of the business during the financial period.
The Group defines EBITDA as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, onerous leases and other nonrecurring charges, impairments and reversals of impairments, transaction and reorganisation costs, profit on disposals of assets.
Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets excluding acquired movie distribution rights, and certain nonrecurring, non cash items and foreign exchange as set out in Note 5.
Adjusted profit before tax is an internal measure used by management, as they believe it better reflects theunderlying performance of the Group.
Adjusted profit after tax is arrived at by applying an effective tax rate to adjusted profit before tax.
Foreign Currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assetsand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate atthe date of the transaction.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translatedat foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of thetransactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations after 23 August 2004 the date of incorporation aretakendirectly to the translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Cash Flow Hedges and Interest Swap Policy Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at thebalance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fairvalue of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value ofthe quoted forward price.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument isrecognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the statement .
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 90 STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting Policies continued For cash flow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement inthe same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income immediately.
Non-Derivative Financial Instruments Nonderivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables were initially measured on the basis of their fair value.
Subsequently they are carried at amortised costusing the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
A bad debt allowance for receivables is established when there isobjective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of thereceivables.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form anintegral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose onlyof the statement of cash flows.
Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-Bearing Borrowings Interestbearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption valuebeing recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items ofproperty, plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as financeleases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower oftheir fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
All other leases are operating leases.
These leased assets are not recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income to write assets down to their residual values on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are asfollows: Land and buildings: freehold properties 50 years Land and buildings: short leasehold properties including leasehold improvements 30 years or life of lease if shorter Plant and machinery 3 to 16 years Fixtures and fittings 3 to 16 years No depreciation is provided on assets held for sale or on assets in the course of construction.
Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are reassessed annually.
Business Combinations For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any previouslyheld equity interest in the acquire and the recognised amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Transactions costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the Group incurs in connection with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Intangible Assets and Goodwill Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Distribution rights that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unlesssuch lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
Distribution rights are amortised by film title from the date of release of the film, at 50% in the first year of release and 25% ineach of the two subsequent years.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Brands 10 to 20 years Distribution rights 3 years Other intangibles 5 to 10 years Non-current Assets Held for Sale A noncurrent asset or a group of assets containing a noncurrent asset a disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, noncurrent assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement although gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss isallocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the FirstIn, FirstOut FIFO principle.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition, and net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated sellingcosts.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill assets that have an indefinite useful economic life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwillallocated to cashgenerating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other intangible assets in the unit ona pro rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent ofthe cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of Recoverable Amount The recoverable amount is the greater of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, theestimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Reversals of Impairment An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 92 STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting Policies continued In respect of other assets, an impairment is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist as aresult of a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, including a change in fair value less costs to sell.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Employee Benefits Defined Contribution Pension Plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement asincurred.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
To calculate thepresent value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest, are recognised immediately in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income OCI The Group determines the net interest expense income on the net defined benefit liability asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the thennet defined benefit liability asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period as a result of contributions andbenefit payments.
Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlementof a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Share-Based Payment Transactions The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date using the BlackScholes model and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
Theamount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture isdue only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights are also granted by the Company to employees.
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee isrecognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is initially measured at grant date and spreadover the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
Theliability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value are recognised intheincome statement.
Government Grants Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will bereceived and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant.
They are then recognised in profit or loss asother income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset to which they relate.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result ofapast event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Own Shares Held by Employee Benefit Trust EBT Transactions of the Group sponsored EBT are included in the Group financial information.
In particular, the trusts purchase ofshares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

Accounting Policies continued Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods sold, excluding sales related taxes and intraGroup transactions.
AlltheGroups revenue is received from the sale of goods and services: Box office revenue is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to.
Concessions revenue is recognised at point of sale.
Advertising revenue is recognised over the period the advert is shown in cinemas.
Distribution revenue is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to.
Unlimited card revenue is received annually or monthly in advance.
When revenue from the Unlimited card is received annually in advance it is recognised on a straightline basis over the year.
Monthly Unlimited card revenue is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Other revenue is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Other Income Other income represents rent receivable and profit on disposals of fixed assets.
Rental income is recognised on a straightline basis over the life of the lease.
Expenses Operating Lease Payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over theterm of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Where the Group has operating leases that contain minimum guaranteed rental uplifts over the life of the lease, theGroup recognises the guaranteed minimum lease payment on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Finance Lease Payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Net Financing Costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable, amortisation of financing costs, unwind of discount on property provisions, finance lease interest, net gain loss on remeasurement of interest rate swaps, interest receivable on funds invested, foreign exchange gains and losses and finance costs for defined benefit pension schemes.
Sale and Leaseback Where the Group enters into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concernedhave not been substantially transferred to the lessor, any excess of sales proceeds over the previous carrying amount are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the lease term.
At the date of the transaction the assets and the associated finance lease liabilities on the Groups balance sheet are stated at the lower of fair value of the leased assets and thepresent value of the minimum lease payments.
Where the Group enters into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concernedhave been substantially transferred to the lessor, any excess of sales proceeds over the previous carrying amount is recognised in the income statement on completion of the transaction, when the sale and subsequent lease back has been completed at fair value.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted atthe balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based onthe expectedmanner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

Accounting Policies continued Operating Segments An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues andincur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
Anoperating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors to make decisions about resources tobe allocated tothe segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In applying the Groups accounting policies described above the Directors have identified that the following areas are the key estimates that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Onerous Leases Provision is made for onerous leases on acquisition of a cinema as part of a business, where it is considered that the unavoidable costs of the lease obligations are in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received from operating it.
The unavoidable costs of the lease reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net cost of continuingto operating the lease and any penalties or other costs from exiting it.
When calculating the provision for an onerous lease the Group is required to make certain assumptions about the future cash flowsto be generated from that cinema site.
It is also required to discount these cash flows using an appropriate discount rate.
Theresulting provision is sensitive to the assumptions in respect of future cash flows.
However, the Directors consider that the assumptions made represent their best estimate of the future cash flows generated by onerous cinema sites, and that the discount rate used is appropriate given the risks associated with these cash flows.
Management has applied sensitivity analysis tothe estimate seeNote 19.
Virtual Print Fees A Virtual Print Fee VPF is recognised as a discount from the cost the Group pays for film rental and reflects the cost saving to the studios of the move to digital.
The income recognition criteria in respect of the VPF received in the UK is complex as itincludes the number, type and timing of screenings.
A VPF is receivable the first time a film is played in a digital format on a screen rather than using 35mm film.
A VPF is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to and is included in cost of sales as a reduction of the film hirecosts.
VPFs in the UK will not be received from 2017 onwards.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimate of the value in use of thecash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate ofthe expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit that holds the goodwill at a determined discount rate to calculate thepresent value of those cash flows.
Forecasting expected cash flows, and selecting an appropriate discount rate inherently requires estimation, however management has also applied sensitivity analysis to the estimates see Note 10.
Impairment of Tangible Fixed Assets The Group determines whether tangible fixed assets are impaired when indicators of impairments exist.
This requires an estimate of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the tangible fixed assets are allocated.
Estimating the value in use requiresthe Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating units that holds the tangible fixed assets at a determined discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
When reviewing fixed assets for impairment, the Group is required to make certain assumptions about the future cash flows to begenerated from the individual cinema sites.
The resulting calculation is sensitive to the assumptions in respect of future cash flows.
However, the Directors consider that the assumptions made represent their best estimate of the future cash flows generated by the cinema sites, and that the discount rate used is appropriategiven the risks associated with these cash flows.
Management has applied sensitivity analysis to the estimates seeNote 9.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Employee Post Retirement Benefit Obligations The Group has two defined benefit pension plans.
The obligations under these plans are recognised in the balance sheet and represent the present value of the obligations calculated by independent actuaries, with input from management.
These actuarial valuations include assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates.
These assumptionsvary from timeto time according to prevailing economic and social conditions.
Details of the assumptions used are provided in Note 18.
Management consider that the assumptions used are the most appropriate but recognise that the resulting pension liability isverysensitive to these assumptions.
Deferred Tax Assets The Group recognises deferred tax assets for temporary differences arising at the balance sheet date.
The Group applies estimates when calculating the carrying value of these assets and considering whether future taxable profits are sufficient toensure their recoverability.
Judgements In addition, the Directors are required to make certain judgements when applying the Groups accounting policies described above.
The key judgements are: Finance and Operating Leases When the Group enters into a new lease it is required to consider whether it bears substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
The Group considers the requirements of IAS 17 Leases when determining whether it has an operating or finance lease, and in most cases the outcome is clear.
Hedging Arrangements The Group enters into interest rate swaps to fix a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates on its loan arrangements.
Inorder to apply the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments, the Group must consider the effectiveness ofitshedging arrangements when deciding whether it can hedge account.
New Standards and Interpretations The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations were adopted for the period ended 31 December 2015 and have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Annual improvements to IFRSs Amendment to IAS 19, Employee benefits IFRIC 21, Levies The Group is currently assessing the impact of the following standards and interpretations which have been issued but which arenot effective at 31 for the period ended 31 December 2015.
These standards and interpretations have not been adopted early.

Operating Segments In 2014 the combination with Cinema City Holdings B. V. led to the Group Board the CODM realigning its management information.
This change gave rise to the inclusion of the additional operating segment, Central and Eastern Europe and Israel CEE & Israel.
During 2015, following the completion of the review by the Competition and Markets Authority on the acquisition of Picturehouse, Picturehouse has now been integrated into the wider UK business.
As such the performance of Cineworld and Picturehouse is now reported together as UK & Ireland.
The Group now has therefore determined that is has two operating segments: UK and Ireland and Central and Eastern Europe and Israel CEE & I.

Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, after excluding the weighted average number of nonvested ordinary shares held by the employee ownership trust.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in the same way except that the profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders is adjusted by adding back the amortisation of intangible assets, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses recognised on the translation of results generated in currencies other than the Groups reporting currency and other oneoff income or expense and then adjusting for the tax impact on those items which is calculated at the effective tax rate for the current period.
The performance of adjusted earnings per share is used to determine awards to Executive Directors under the Group Performance Share Plan PSP.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by weighted average number of any nonvested ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership trust and after adjusting for the effects of dilutive options.

Factors that May Affect Future Tax Charges As at 31 December 2015 the Group had potential UK tax assets relating to the following: Capital losses of approximately 8.7m 2014: 8.7m.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of UK and capital losses carried forward as it is not considered probable that future nontrading income or capital gains will be realised in the UK against which the losses may be utilised.
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures where the Group controls the timing of remittance and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
Further reductions to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
TheUKdeferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2015 have been calculated based on these rates.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had potential overseas tax assets relating to the following: Trading losses of approximately 7.1m.
Other temporary differences of approximately 10.2m.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on these temporary differences as it is not considered probable that future trading income or capital gains will be realised in these countries against which the assets can be utilised.
The Group operates in nine countries and is subject to a wide range of tax laws and regulations.
At any point in time it is normalfor there to be a number of open years in any particular territory which may be subject to enquiry by local tax authorities.
The group considers estimates, assumptions and judgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues which can take years to resolve.
The final determination of prior year tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reflected in the financial statements.

Interest of 1,209,000 2014: 89,000 has been capitalised during the period which relates to the construction of new sites.
With respect to the tangible fixed asset disposals, no proceeds were receivable in the period.
Impairment The Group considers each Cinema site to be a cash generating unit CGU and each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators ofimpairment.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value inuse using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pretax discount rate for the relevant territory, a table summarising the rates used is set out below.

Cash flows beyond the first period have been extrapolated using the assumptions used in the impairment model.
The 2.7m impairment loss, recognised in the CEE & Israel operating segment, was caused by trading not reaching expectations for the foreseeable future in relation to three cinema sites.
Of the 6.3m impairment loss recognised in the UK and Ireland operating segment, 5.6m relates to development costs incurred on a site for which an onerous lease provision is in place, the remaining 0.7m was caused by trading not reaching expectations for the foreseeable future in relation to one cinema site.
The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections for the purpose of the impairment review are as follows: UK & Ireland CEE & Israel 52 week 53 week 52 week 53 week period ended period ended period ended period ended 31 December 1 January 31 December 1 January 2015 2015 2015 2015 % % % % 1 1 Discount rate 11.36 11.12 N A N A 2 EBITDAR growth rate 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 Property cost growth rate 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 1 Individual discount rates for each operating territory have been used, a summary is disclosed above.
2 Flat growth rate assumptions are used for projections on established sites.
For new sites, where a flat growth would not accurately reflect market conditions, more detailed growth assumptions are used for the first five years.
2016 forecast EBITDA, as defined in Note 1, was used as the basis of the future cash flow calculation.
This is adjusted to add back rent EBITDAR.
In line with longterm industry growth rates, EBITDAR is assumed to grow at 2.0% per annum from year3onwards.
Property costs are factored into the model, but are assumed to grow at 3.0% per annum over the life of the model.
Cash flows are projected over the shorter of the life of the property lease or the intangible assets to which the cash flow relates Impairment Reversals A review of future cashflows for previously impaired cinema sites did not identify improvement in trading performance sufficient to recognise a reversal of impairment.
Sensitivity to Changes in Assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon forecasting future performance as well as the judgements used inarrivingat future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge ofapplying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the first five years and in the discount rates would be as follows: m Potential impairment if business plan growth rates reached 75% assumptions used above 5.3 Potential impairment if property cost growth rates were increased by 1% for first five years 0.6 Potential impairment if discount rate was increased by 1% 2.1 | CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 104 STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 10.

However, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, it is acceptable under IAS 36 to group CGUs, in order to reflect the level at which it is monitored by management.
The exCineUK and exUGC including Dublin businesses are now fully integrated, meaning that goodwill is now monitored ona Cineworld wide level.
The Picturehouse and Cinema City CGUs are considered as separate groups and have been tested for goodwill impairment on this basis, the Cinema City CGUs are considered on a territory basis, the territories being Poland 2015: 85.3m, 2014: 90.4m, Israel 2015: 52.6m, 2014: 50.3m, Hungary 2015: 40.3m, 2014: 43.0m, Romania 2015: 85.8m, 2014: 91.9m, Bulgaria 2015: 13.1m, 2014: 13.9m, Czech 2015: 22.8m, 2014: 23.7m and Slovakia 2015: 3.2m, 2014: 3.4m.
The recoverable amount of Cineworld, Picturehouse and Cinema City CGUs have been determined based on a value in usecalculation.
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering afiveyear period.
Cash flows beyond the first year period have been extrapolated using the below assumptions.
This growth ratedoes not exceed the longterm average growth rate for the market in which the CGU operates.
The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections for the purpose of the impairment review are as follows: UK & Ireland CEE & Israel 52 week 53 week 52 week 53 week period ended period ended period ended period ended 31 December 1 January 31 December 1 January 2015 2015 2015 2015 % % % % 1 1 Discount rate 11.36 11.12 N A N A EBITDA growth rate 2.00 3.00 2.00 3.00 1 Individual discount rates for each operating territory have been used, a summary is disclosed in Note 9.
Cineworld and Picturehouse have discounted forecast flows using a pretax discount rate of 11.36% 2014: 11.12% being a market participants discount rate.
Cinema City have discounted forecast flows using a pretax discount rates relevant to the operating territory of each territory CGU see note 10, being a market participants discount rate.
This is considered to reflect the risks associated with the relevant cash flows each CGU.
Management have sensitised the key assumptions in the goodwill impairment tests including the discount rate and under both the base case and sensitised cases no indicators of impairment exist.
Management believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount for any CGUs assessed.

Non-Current Assets Held For Sale The Competition Commission ruled on 31 January 2014 that as a result of Cineworld Group plc acquiring City Screen Limited and its subsidiaries Picturehouse there was a substantial lessening of competition in three local geographical areas and that the divestment of either a Cineworld or Picturehouse cinema in each of the affected cities was required.
As a result, the Group has divested itself of assets in Aberdeen and Bury St Edmunds in 2014 and divested assets in Cambridge on 29 January 2015.
The values in the table below represent the net book value of property, plant and equipment and associated liabilities which are shown as current assets and liabilities held for sale.
Since the fair value less costs to sell is expected to be in excess of the net bookvalue of the property, plant and equipment no impairment of such assets is required.

Employee Benefits Pension Plans The Group operates two externally funded defined benefit pension schemes, one in the United Kingdom, the MGM Pension Scheme, and one in Ireland, the AdelphiCarlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan.
Adelphi-Carlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan The AdelphiCarlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan is closed to new entrants and therefore the current service cost is nil.
Thetrustees of the AdelphiCarlton Contributory Pension Plan have not agreed that any surplus on the plan can be refunded tothe Company.
Accordingly the surplus has not been recognised.
The Scheme has a surplus of 0.6m as at 31 December 2015 2014:0.5m.
Actuaries for AdelphiCarlton Limited carried out the last actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 1 April 2013.
Based on this assessment, the actuarial value of the assets of the scheme was more than sufficient to cover 100% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
In view of this, a suspension of Company contributions was in force from 1 April 2001 to 31 December 2015.
Totalcontributions for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2015 and 53 weeks ended 1 January 2015 were nil and nil, respectively.
No contributions are expected for the year ended 31 December 2016.
MGM Scheme The Scheme is a funded scheme of the defined benefit type, providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
The Scheme closed to future accrual from 31 May 2009, though the link to final pay at retirement was retained.
The Group has engaged its actuarys assistance in measuring the defined benefit asset for the purposes of IAS19 revised for the period ended 31 December 2015.
The valuation used for IAS19 disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the Scheme as at 5 April 2012.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the period in which they occur, but outside the Income Statement, through Other Comprehensive Income.
The Company made contributions of 1.6m during 2015 2014: 1.6m.

For the Scheme as a whole, the duration is around 15 years reflecting the approximate split of the defined benefit obligation between current employees duration of 26 years, deferred members duration of 20 years and current pensioners duration of ten years.
Funding Requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently.
The last funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out bya qualified actuary as at 5 April 2015 and showed a surplus of 1.7m.
The Company is paying deficit contributions of 1.6m per annum to support the scheme, along with investment returns from returnseeking assets.
The next funding valuation is due no later than 5 April 2018.
Risks Associated With the Scheme The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Asset Volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets equity diversified growth funds and global absolute return fund which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the longterm, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes longterm objectives.
Changes in Bond Yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation Risk A significant proportion of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life Expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP.
The UK Government intends to implement legislation which could result in an increase in the value of GMP for males.
This would increase the defined benefit obligation of the plan.
At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.
The amounts recognised on the Balance Sheet are set out below: 31 December 1 January 2015 2015 m m Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 31.0 32.4 Fair value of plan assets 41.5 41.0 Surplus in scheme 10.5 8.6 When the members benefits have been fully paid, the rules of the scheme permit any surplus to revert to the employer theGroup.
Therefore the surplus on the scheme has been recognised as an asset.

The Group expects to contribute approximately 1.6m to its defined benefit plans in the next financial period.
Defined Contribution Plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was 0.6m 2014: 0.6m.
There was 0.1m accruing to these pension schemes as at 31 December 2015 2014: 0.1m.
Accrued Employee Retirement Rights Local applicable labour laws and agreements in CEE require certain group companies to pay severance pay to dismissed or retiring employees including those leaving their employment under certain other circumstances.
The calculation of the severancepay liability has been made in accordance with labour agreements in force and based on salary components that, inmanagements opinion, create entitlement to severance pay.
Group companies severance pay liabilities to their employees are funded partially by regular deposits with recognised pension and severance pay funds in the employees names and by purchase of insurance policies.
They are accounted for as if they were a defined contribution plan.
The amounts funded as above are netted against the related liabilities and are not reflected in the statement of financial position since they are not under the control and management of the companies.
The amounts of the liability for severance pay presented in the statement of financial position see below reflect that part of the liability not covered by the funds and the insurance policies mentioned above, as well as the liability that is funded by deposits withrecognised central severance pay funds held under the name of the Companys subsidiaries.

Market rent provisions relate to the fair value of liabilities on leases acquired with Cinema City Holdings B. V. The majority of the property provision relates to onerous leases, which are made on the acquisition of a cinema as part of a business, being the unavoidable costs of the lease obligations in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received from operating it.
The unavoidable costs of the lease reflect the lease net cost of exiting from the contract and is measured as the lower of the net cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs from exiting it, measured on a discounted basis.
The remaining provision will be utilised over the period to the next rent review date or the remaining lease life depending onthe term of the lease.

Financial Instruments Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Group has in place a risk management programme and regular reports are made to the Audit Committee, which is tasked withgeneral oversight.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles andobligations.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit.
Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of certain risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 121 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21.
Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet itscontractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
However, due to the nature of the Groups business, trade receivables are not significant which limits the related credit risk.
The Groups trade receivables are disclosed in Note 14.
Of the total balance of 23.5m 2014: 22.6m due 83% 2014: 68% are within credit terms.
The bad debt provision as at 2015 is 306,000 2014:11,000, with a bad debt expense in the period of Nil 2014: nil.
Based on past experience the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of the trade receivables that are past due.
The credit risk on liquidfunds and derivative financial instruments is also limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach tomanaging liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of nettingagreements.

The total facility at the balance sheet date translated at the applicable exchange rate totalled 364.6m.
As a result, the term loans have reduced from 157.5m and 126.0m to 130.0m and 63.0m.
The Group now has a single multicurrency revolving credit facility of 190m 2 July 2015: 75m and 60.0m.
Based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, the revised facility totalled 364.7m.
Whilst the overall level of facility has not materially changed since the balance sheet date, management believe that revised structure better reflects the | CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 122 STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21.
Financial Instruments continued financing and working capital needs of the Group.
A margin, determined by the results of the covenant tests at a given date is added to LIBOR or EURIBOR.
The margin on the revised term loans can now range between 0.95% and 2.65% previously 1.65% and 3.15% and the revised margin on the single revolving credit facility can range between 0.70% and 2.40% previously 1.40% and 2.90%.
The margins currently applicable to Group are 1.65% on the term loan and 1.40% on the revolving credit facility.
Cash Flow Hedges The following table indicates the periods in which the discounted cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign Currency Risk Following the acquisition of Cinema City the Group is subject to greater currency risk exposure.
Wherever possible, overseas operations will fund their daytoday working capital requirements in local currency with cash generated from operations, naturally hedging the currency risk exposure to the Group.
Management will continually monitor the level of currency risk exposure, and consider hedging whereappropriate.
Currently the Group considers the currency risk on consolidation of theassetsand liabilities of its foreign entities to be of low materiality and no hedging has been undertaken.
Interest Rate Risk The Groups policy is to manage its cost of borrowing by securing fixed interest rates on a portion of its term loan.
Whilst fixedrate interestbearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group toenjoya reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling.
In addition, the fair value risk inherent in fixedrate borrowing means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs should debt berestructured or repaid early as part of the liquidity management process.
The Group uses interest rate swaps agreed with other parties to hedge a portion of its bank loans that have fixed interest rates.
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value, which have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.

Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments The Group accounts for fixedrate derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps at fair value.
Hedge accounting was adopted from the year ended 27 December 2007 on the swap taken out in May 2007.
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased equity by 1.9m 2014: 1.8m or decreased equity by 1.9m 2014: 1.8m for each swap and would have increased or decreased profit or loss by nil 2014: nil.

The carrying amount of unsecured bank loans is stated net of debt issuance costs and the fair value is stated gross of debt issuance costs and is calculated using the market interest rates.
The difference between net carrying amount and estimated fair value reflects unrealised gains or losses inherent in the instruments based on valuations at 31 December 2015 and 1 January 2015.
The volatile nature of the markets means that valuesatany subsequent date could be significantly different from the values reported above.
Fair Value Hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined asfollows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly i. e. asprices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.

Business Combinations On 10 January 2014, Cineworld Group plc the Group announced the combination with the cinema business of Cinema City International N. V. which has since changed its name to Global City Holdings N. V. GCH, by means of an acquisition of 100% ofthe shares, including all voting rights, in Cinema City Holdings B. V. CCH, a subsidiary of GCH.
Consideration Transferred At the date of announcement, the headline consideration for the combination equated to 503m in cash and shares and 14.5mfor the settlement of CCH bank debt.
The combination was completed on 28 February 2014, at which point adjustments for certain provisions of the purchase agreement resulted in a fair value of consideration transferred of 510.6m.
Consideration for the transaction was settled with a mix of cash and shares.
Final cash consideration of 302.6m was part funded by an 8 for 25 Rights Issue which completed on 14 February 2014, raising net funds of 107.2m with the residual cash consideration being funded within the Groups new debt facility.
The Group issued to GCH shares in Cineworld Group plc which were valued at 208.0m when the combination completed on 28 February 2014.
The consideration shares represented 24.9% ofthe post rights issue share capital of the Group.
Fair Value of Consideration Transferred m Cash consideration 302.6 Share consideration 208.0 Total fair value of consideration transferred 510.6 The fair value of the 65.6m ordinary shares issued to GCH as part of the consideration was based on the published share price of317p at the close of business on 27 February 2014.

Old cinema equipment and assets from nontrading sites which were previously held at their residual value of 10.8m were fully depreciated as the residual value is not expected to be realised.
Assets with a net book value of 7.1m at the date of acquisition were provided for due to the fact that they related to lossmaking cinemas.
A further 9.9m 10.7m stated previously on a provisional basis, based on certain assumptions until all the information was available fair value write down was recognised where the sitespecific forecasted cashflows discounted by applying a country specific market participant discount rate did not support the net book value ofthesites assets at the date of acquisition.
As well as considering the fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment, management also considered the lease contract for each of the cinemas.
A provision of 3.6m was made in respect of onerous lease contracts.
The provision reflects the present value of the future lease payments under these contracts at the date of acquisition to the extent that the contract results in the site becoming loss making.
A smaller number of leases were identified with future contractual fixed increases in rent.
A provision of 1.8m was recognised in respect of these contractual increases in line with IAS 17s: Leases requirement to recognise the future minimum payments on a straightline basis over the life of the lease.
An exercise was conducted to compare the current rentals of each of the sites to the current assumed average market rental rate.
Accordingly, a net provision of 5.7m was recognised in respect of a number of sites where the current rental rate is either above or below the assumed average market rental rate.
An asset in respect of future deduction against rent payments in Poland of 2.4m was writtendown by 2.0m, asitsfull recovery was doubtful.

The deferred tax liabilities of 7.2m also include 5.4m in respect of temporary tax differences arising on the fair value adjustments made to acquired assets andliabilities.
Included within trade and other payables is an income tax liability of 3.4m recognised on acquisition.
The liability reflects expected future tax charges in respect of tax positions open at the date of acquisition.
Other Fair Value Adjustments Other fair value adjustments include 3.1m accelerated amortisation of distribution rights and intellectual property where fullrecovery is considered doubtful.
Prepaid debt arrangement fees in respect of Cinema Citys old financing totalling 4.8m were released following the extinguishment of the loans at the date of acquisition.
