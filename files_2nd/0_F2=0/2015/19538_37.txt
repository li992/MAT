Notes to the Company Notes to the Company financial statements financial statements 1 Accounting policies a.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards as defined in section 464 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006.
The loss included in the financial statements of the Company, determined in accordance with the Act, was 768.8m.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures and has not reported transactions with fellow Group undertakings.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash flow statement The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement as a consolidated cash flow statement has been presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
c. Investments Investments in Group undertakings are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
d. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less or to receive more, tax.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
e. Share-based payments The Company provides benefits to employees including Directors of Saga plc and its subsidiary undertakings, in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value on the grant date and is recognised as an expense over the relevant vesting period, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award.
Fair values of share-based payment transactions are calculated using Black-Scholes modelling techniques.
In valuing equitysettled transactions, assessment is made of any vesting conditions to categorise these into market performance conditions, non-market performance conditions and service conditions.
Where the equity-settled transactions have market performance conditions that is, performance which is directly or indirectly linked to the share price, the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is not changed, regardless of the actual level of vesting achieved, except where the employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date.
For service conditions and non-market performance conditions, the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is reassessed at each reporting date to reflect updated expectations for the level of vesting.
No expense is recognised for awards that ultimately do not vest.
At each reporting date prior to vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and, in the case of non-market conditions, the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of instruments subject to market conditions, the fair value on grant adjusted only for leavers.
The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the Profit and loss account, with the corresponding increase in share-based payments reserve.
Upon vesting of an equity instrument, the cumulative cost in the share-based payments reserve is reclassified to reserves.
