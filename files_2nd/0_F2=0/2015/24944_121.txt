The total amount may be greater than the book value of assets utilised as collateral for funding purposes or to cover liabilities, for example, in the case of securitisations and covered bonds where the amount of liabilities issued plus any mandatory  is less than the book value of financial assets available for funding or collateral purposes in the relevant pool of assets.
This is also the case where financial assets are placed with a custodian or a settlement agent which has a floating charge over all the financial assets placed to secure any liabilities under settlement accounts.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivative margining.
HSBC places both cash and non-cash collateral in relation to derivative transactions.
Assets transferred Accounting policy Derecognition of financial assets Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired: or when HSBC has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows of the financial assets, and either: substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred: or HSBC has neither retained nor transferred substantially all the risks and rewards, but has not retained control.
The financial assets shown above include amounts transferred to third parties that do not qualify for derecognition, notably debt securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements and equity securities lent under securities lending agreements.
As the substance of these transactions is secured borrowings, the asset collateral continues to be recognised in full and the related liability reflecting the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets for a fixed price at a future date is also recognised on the balance sheet.
As a result of these transactions, the Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction.
The Group remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged instruments.
The counterpartys recourse is not limited to the transferred assets.
