235876 Finsbury WWH pp69-pp86new 03 07 2015 12:41 Page 81 4 Further Information Explanatory Notes of the Principal Changes to the Companys Articles of Association Set out below is a summary of the principal differences between the current and the proposed new Articles of Association the Articles.
These changes to the new Articles, to be adopted at the Annual General Meeting to be held on Thursday, 24 September 2015 relate to: FATCA The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act 2010 of the United States of America commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and all associated regulations and official guidance FATCA imposes a system of information reporting on certain entities including foreign financial institutions such as the Company following the enactment of the UK International Tax Compliance United States of America Regulations 2013 on 1 September 2013.
These regulations have now been replaced by the International Tax Compliance Regulations 2015 which also include the automatic exchange of information regimes being brought in under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Union.
The Articles of Association have therefore been amended in order to provide the Company with the ability to require shareholders to co-operate in respect of these broader obligations and not just with its obligations under FATCA as is currently the case.
Subscription Shares and Special Deferred Shares The other changes to the Articles of Association are being made to remove references to Subscription Shares and Special Deferred Shares and to the rights attached to those classes of shares which are now obsolete following the exercise in full of the Subscription Shares.
A copy of the current Articles and of the proposed new Articles marked up to show the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the offices of Frostrow Capital LLP during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting, in each case until conclusion of the meeting.
