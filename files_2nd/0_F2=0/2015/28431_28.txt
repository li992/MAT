Executive Directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their location.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes UK-based Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
This scheme allows all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.
In 2014, participants could elect to enter into savings contracts of up to 500 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares.
If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules.
Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised.
No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.
Details of Executive Directors rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the Statement of directors shareholdings.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK-based Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP.
From April 2014, all UK-based employees were able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of 150 per month from their gross salary partnership shares through the SIP.
For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential on the open market.
Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan.
If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.
The table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with Matching Shares awarded on a 1:4 basis and dividend shares.

For every two shares bought by the employee, one additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential on the open market.

Dilution Releases from the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan and GPSP are satisfied using new issue shares rather than by purchasing shares in the open market.
Shares relating to options granted under all-employee share plans are also satisfied by new issue shares.
The combined dilution from all outstanding shares and options at 31 December 2015 was 0.1 per cent of the total share capital at the time.
Deferred shares will continue to be satisfied by the purchase of shares in the open market.

These accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented and normally are not subject to changes unless new accounting standards, interpretations or amendments are introduced by the IASB.
a ,  Prudential believes that its critical accounting policies are limited to those referenced in the table below: Accounting  policyreference Classification of insurance and investment contracts A3.1 c Measurement of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus of with-profits fund A3.1 d Measurement and presentation of derivatives and debt securities of US insurance operations A3.1 j v Presentation of results before tax A3.1 k Segmental analysis of results and earnings distributable to shareholders A3.1 m The preparation of these financial statements requires Prudential to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Prudential evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term business provisioning and the fair value of assets.
The table below sets out items that require the Group to make critical estimates and judgements in applying the relevant accounting policy: Accounting  policyreference Classification of insurance and investment contracts A3.1 c Measurement of policyholder liabilities A3.1 d Measurement of deferred acquisition costs A3.1 f Determination of fair value of financial investments A3.1 j ii Determining impairment relating to financial assets A3.1 j iii b Basisofconsolidation The Group consolidates those investees it is deemed to control.
The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met: 1 it has power over an investee: 2 it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 3 it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.
i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those investees which the Group controls.
The vast majority of the Groups subsidiaries are corporate entities where the Group holds the majority of voting rights and are consolidated.
The consolidation of other vehicles held by the Group is discussed below: The Groups insurance operations invest in a number of limited partnerships, either directly or through unit trusts, through a mix of capital and loans.
These limited partnerships are managed by general partners, in which the Group holds equity.
Such interest in general partners and limited partnerships provide the Group with voting and similar rights to participate in the governance framework of the relevant activities in which limited partnerships are engaged in.
Accounting for the limited partnerships as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on the terms of each partnership agreement and the shareholdings in the general partners.
In the context of direct investment in limited partnerships, the following circumstances may indicate a relationship in which, in substance, the Group controls and consequently consolidates a limited partnership: The Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the limited partnership, ie activities that significantly affect the generation of economic returns from the limited partnerships operation: The Group has the power to obtain the significant benefits of the activities of the limited partnerships.
Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant benefits if its participation in the limited partnership is greater than 20 per cent: and The Group has the current ability to join together with other partners to direct the activities of the partnership.
The Group performs a reassessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship between the Group and a limited partnership.
Where the Group is deemed to control a limited partnership, it is treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities are consolidated.
Where the Group holds a minority share in a limited partnership, with no control over their associated general partners, the investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The limited partnerships consolidated by the Group include Qualifying Partnerships as defined under the UK Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 the Partnerships Act.
Certain of these limited partnerships have taken advantage of the exemption under regulation 7 of the Partnerships Act from the financial statements requirements under regulations 4 to 6, on the basis that these limited partnerships are dealt with on a consolidated basis in these financial statements.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 141 A:  A3:  A3.1  ii  Joint ventures are joint arrangements arising from a contractual agreement whereby the Group and other investors have joint control of the net assets of the arrangement.
In a number of these arrangements, the Groups share of the underlying net assets may be less than 50 per cent but the terms of the relevant agreement make it clear that control is jointly exercised between the Group and the third party.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but it does not control.
Generally it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent voting rights of the entity.
With the exception of those referred to below, the Group accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates by using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of profit or loss of its joint ventures and associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The equity method of accounting does not apply to investments in associates and joint ventures held by the Groups insurance or investment funds including venture capital business or mutual funds or unit trusts, which as allowed by IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
iii Structuredentities Structured entities are those which have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
In addition to the entities discussed above in A3.1b i, the Group as part of its business strategy invests in structured entities such as Open-Ended Investment Companies OEICs, Unit Trusts UTs, variable interest entities, investment vehicles within separate accounts offered through variable annuities, collateralised debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities, and similar asset-backed securities.
Open-ended investment companies and unit trusts The Group invests in OEICs and UTs, which invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties.
The Groups percentage ownership in these entities can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Group and other investors in them.
For these entities, the following circumstances may indicate, in substance, the Group has power over an entity: The entity is managed by the Groups asset manager and the Group holds a significant investment in the entity: and Where the entity is managed by an asset manager outside the Group, Prudential has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the current activities of the entity.
In assessing the Groups ability to direct an entity, the Group considers its ability relative to other investors.
The Group has a limited number of OEICs and UTs where it considers it has such ability.
For an entity managed by asset managers outside the Group with no current ability to direct its activities, the Group is deemed to have no power over such an entity.
For those entities managed by the Groups asset managers, it is generally presumed that the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from an entity and has ability to use its power to affect its own returns where the Groups holding is greater than 50 per cent and is deemed to have no significant influence over an entity for holdings less than 20 per cent.
For holdings between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, the Group performs an assessment of power and associated control over an entity on a case-by-case basis.
For these entities, the following circumstances may indicate that the Group controls an entity: The Group has power over the relevant activities of the entity: and The exposure, or rights, to variable returns including administrative and performance fees earned by the Groups asset manager from the entity is higher than the Groups interest.
Where the Group is deemed to control these entities they are treated as a subsidiary and are consolidated, with the interests of investors other than the Group being classified as liabilities and appear as net asset value attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
Where the Group does not control these entities as it is deemed to be acting as an agent and they do not meet the definition of associates, they are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Where the Groups asset manager sets up the OEICs and UTs as part of asset management operations, the Groups interest is limited to the administration fees charged to manage the assets of such entities.
With no participation in these entities, the Group does not retain risks associated with OEICs and UTs.
For these open-ended investment companies and unit trusts, the Group is not deemed to control the entities but to be acting as an agent.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in investment vehicles commensurate to its participation and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks of these investment vehicles.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Jacksons separate account assets Jackson offers variable contracts that invest contract holders premiums, at the contract holders direction, in investment vehicles Separate Accounts that invest in equity, fixed income, bonds and money market mutual funds.
The contract holder retains the underlying returns and the ownership risks related to the separate accounts and its underlying investments.
The shareholders economic interest in separate accounts is limited to the administrative fees charged.
The separate accounts are set up as separate regulated entities governed by a Board of Governors or trustees for which the majority of the members are independent of Jackson or any affiliated entity.
The independent members represent contract holders interest and are responsible for any decision making that impacts contract holders interest and governs the operational activities of the entities advisers, including asset managers managing the investment vehicles.
Accordingly, the Group does not control these vehicles.
These investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Other structured entities The Group holds investments in mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar asset-backed securities that are actively traded in a liquid market.
The Group is not the sponsor of the vehicles in which it holds investments and has no administrative rights over the vehicles activities.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks commensurate to its holding and its exposure to the investments.
Accordingly the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of such vehicles and all are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The table below provides aggregate carrying amounts of the investments in unconsolidated structured entities reported in the Groups statement of financial position: 2015 m 2014 m Separate Other Separate Other account structured account structured OEICs UTs assets entities OEICs UTs assets entities  Equity securities and portfolio holdings in unit trusts 12,945 91,022 12,690 81,741 Debt securities 11,735 12,715 Total 12,945 91,022 11,735 12,690 81,741 12,715 The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in these investments commensurate to its participation and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks or losses of the investments or the vehicles in which it holds investments.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group does not have an agreement, contractual or otherwise, or intention to provide financial support to structured entities that could expose the Group to a loss.
c  IFRS 4 requires contracts written by insurers to be classified as either insurance contracts or investment contracts depending on the level of insurance risk transferred.
Insurance risk is a pre-existing risk, other than financial risk, transferred from the contract holder to the contract issuer.
If significant insurance risk is transferred to the Group then it is classified as an insurance contract.
Contracts that transfer financial risk to the Group but not significant insurance risk are termed investment contracts.
Furthermore, some contracts, both insurance and investment, contain discretionary participating features representing the contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits: a That are likely to be a significant portion of the total contract benefits: b Whose amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the insurer: and c That are contractually based on asset or fund performance, as discussed in IFRS 4.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 143 A:  A3:  A3.1  d  The measurement basis of policyholder liabilities is dependent upon the classification of the contracts under IFRS 4 described in note A3.1 c above.
IFRS 4 permits the continued usage of previously applied Generally Accepted Accounting Practices GAAP for insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features.
Accordingly, except for UK regulated with-profits funds which were measured under FRS 27 as discussed below, the modified statutory basis of reporting as set in the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by Association of British Insurers ABI SORP was adopted by the Group on first time adoption of IFRS in 2005.
FRS 27 and the ABI SORP were withdrawn in the UK for the accounting periods beginning in or after 2015.
As used in these consolidated financial statements, the terms FRS 27 and the ABI SORP refer to the requirements of these pronouncements prior to their withdrawal.
For investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features, IAS 39 is applied and, where the contract includes an investment management element, IAS 18, Revenue, applies.
For with-profits funds, as the shareholders participation in the cost of bonuses arises only on distribution, the Group has elected to account for the unallocated surplus of UK regulated with-profits funds as a liability with no allocation to equity.
The policy of measuring contract liabilities at business unit level is noted below.
Additional details are discussed in note C4.2.
i Insurancecontracts Asia insurance operations The policyholder liabilities for businesses in Asia are determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with the modified statutory basis.
Refinements to the local reserving methodology are generally treated as changes in estimates, dependent on their nature.
For the operations in India, Taiwan and, up until 2015, Japan, the local GAAP is not appropriate as a starting point in the context of the modified statutory basis, and, instead, the accounting for insurance contracts is based on US GAAP.
For these operations the business written is primarily non-participating linked and participating business.
The future policyholder benefit provisions for non-participating linked business are determined using the net level premium method, with an allowance for surrenders, maintenance and claim expenses.
Rates of interest used in establishing the policyholder benefit provisions vary by operation depending on the circumstances attaching to each block of business.
Where appropriate, liabilities for participating business for these operations include provisions for the policyholders interest in investment gains and other surpluses that have yet to be declared as bonuses.
While the basis of valuation of liabilities in this business is in accordance with the requirements of the ABI SORP, it may differ from that determined on the modified statutory basis for UK operations with the same features.
US insurance operations In accordance with the modified statutory basis, the policyholder liabilities for Jacksons conventional protection-type policies are determined under US GAAP principles with locked-in assumptions for mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses along with provisions for adverse deviations.
For other policies, the policyholder liabilities includes the policyholder account balance.
Acquisition costs are accounted for as explained in note A3.1 f below.
UK insurance operations The UK regulated with-profits funds are accounted for by the voluntary application of the UK accounting standard FRS 27 Life Assurance that requires liabilities to be calculated as the realistic basis liabilities.
The realistic basis liabilities are measured by reference to the PRAs Peak 2 basis of reporting.
This Peak 2 basis requires the value of liabilities to be calculated as: A with-profits benefits reserve: plus Future policy related liabilities: plus The realistic current liabilities of the fund.
The with-profits benefits reserve is primarily based on the retrospective calculation of accumulated asset shares but is adjusted to reflect future policyholder benefits and other outgoings.
Asset shares broadly reflect the policyholders share of the with-profits fund assets attributable to their policies.
The future policy-related liabilities must include a market consistent valuation of costs of guarantees, options and smoothing, less any related charges, and this amount is determined using either a stochastic approach, hedging costs or a series of deterministic projections with attributed probabilities.
The Peak 2 basis realistic liabilities for with-profits business currently include the element for the shareholders share of the future cost of bonuses consistent with the contract asset shares.
For accounting purposes under FRS 27, this latter item is not shown as part of contract liabilities.
This is because, consistent with the current basis of financial reporting, shareholder transfers are recognised only on declaration.
Instead, the shareholders share of future costs of bonuses is included within the liabilities for unallocated surplus.
Other UK insurance contracts that contain significant insurance risk include unit-linked, annuity and other non-profit business.
For the purposes of local regulations, segregated accounts are established for linked business for which policyholder benefits are wholly or partly determined by reference to specific investments or to an investment-related index.
The interest rates used in establishing policyholder benefit provisions for pension annuities in the course of payment are adjusted each year.
Mortality rates used in establishing policyholder benefits are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect actual experience.
144 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information ii  For investment contracts with discretionary participation features, the accounting basis is consistent with the accounting for similar with-profits insurance contracts.
iii  The measurement of investment contracts without discretionary participation features is carried out in accordance with IAS 39 to reflect the deposit nature of the arrangement, with premiums and claims reflected as deposits and withdrawals and taken directly to the statement of financial position as movements in the financial liability balance.
Under IFRS, investment contracts excluding those with discretionary participation features accounted for as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 which also offer investment management services, require the application of IAS 18 for the revenue attached to these services.
Incremental, directly attributable acquisition costs relating to the investment management element of these contracts are capitalised and amortised in line with the related revenue.
If the contracts involve up-front charges, this income is also deferred and amortised through the income statement in line with contractual service provision.
For those investment contracts in the US with fixed and guaranteed terms, the Group uses the amortised cost model to measure the liability.
Those investment contracts without fixed and guaranteed terms are designated as fair value through profit or loss because the resulting liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Where the contract includes a surrender option its carrying value is subject to a minimum carrying value equal to its surrender value.
iv  Unallocated surplus represents the excess of assets over policyholder liabilities for the Groups with-profits funds that have yet to be appropriated between policyholders and shareholders.
As allowed under IFRS 4, the Group has opted to continue to record unallocated surplus of with-profits funds wholly as a liability with no allocation to equity.
The annual excess shortfall of income over expenditure of the with-profits funds, after declaration and attribution of the cost of bonuses to policyholders and shareholders, is transferred to from the unallocated surplus each year through a charge credit to the income statement.
The balance retained in the unallocated surplus represents cumulative income arising on the with-profits business that has not been allocated to policyholders or shareholders.
The balance of the unallocated surplus is determined after full provision for deferred tax on unrealised appreciation on investments.
e Reinsurance The measurement of reinsurance assets is consistent with the measurement of the underlying direct insurance contracts.
The treatment of any gains or losses arising on the purchase of reinsurance contracts is dependent on the underlying accounting basis of the entity concerned.
f  Except for acquisition costs of with-profits contracts of the UK regulated with-profits funds, which are accounted for under the realistic PRA regime, costs of acquiring new insurance business are accounted for in a way that is consistent with the principles of the ABI SORP with deferral and amortisation against margins in future revenues on the related insurance policies.
Costs of acquiring new insurance business, principally commissions, marketing and advertising and certain other costs associated with policy insurance and underwriting that are not reimbursed by policy charges, are specifically identified and capitalised as part of deferred acquisition costs.
In general, this deferral is presentationally shown by an explicit carrying value in the balance sheet.
However, in some Asia operations the deferral is implicit through the reserving methodology.
The recoverability of the explicitly and implicitly deferred acquisition costs is measured and are deemed impaired if the projected margins are less than the carrying value.
To the extent that the future margins differ from those anticipated, then an adjustment to the carrying value will be necessary.
The deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs is of most relevance to the Groups results for Asia and US insurance operations.
The deferred acquisition costs for US and some Asia operations are determined with reference to US GAAP principles.
Asia insurance operations For those territories applying US GAAP to insurance assets and liabilities, as permitted by the ABI SORP, principles similar to those set out in the US insurance operations paragraph below are applied to the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs.
For other territories in Asia, the general principles of the ABI SORP are applied with, as described above, deferral of acquisition costs being either explicit or implicit through the reserving basis.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 145 A:  A3:  A3.1  US insurance operations Under IFRS 4, the Group applies grandfathered US GAAP for measuring the insurance assets and liabilities of US insurance operations.
The Group applies FAS ASU 2010-26 on Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts and capitalises only those incremental costs directly relating to successfully acquiring a contract.
For term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums.
For annuity and interest-sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For fixed and fixed index annuity and interest-sensitive life business, the key assumption is the long-term spread between the earned rate on investments and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of Jacksons actual industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual mortality, lapse and expenses experience is performed using internally developed experience studies.
For US variable annuity business, a key assumption is the long-term investment return from the separate accounts, which is determined using a mean reversion methodology.
Under the mean reversion methodology, projected returns over the next five years are flexed subject to capping so that, combined with the actual rates of return for the current and the previous two years the assumed long-term level of returns from the separate accounts is maintained.
The projected rates of return are capped at no more than 15 per cent for each of the next five years.
These returns affect the level of future expected profits through their effects on the fee income with consequential impact on the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
The level of acquisition costs carried in the statement of financial position is also sensitive to unrealised valuation movements on debt securities held to back the liabilities and solvency capital.
Further details are discussed in note C5.1 b.
As permitted by IFRS 4, Jackson uses shadow accounting to make adjustments to the deferred acquisition costs which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Jackson accounts for the majority of its investment portfolio on an available-for-sale basis whereby unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
To the extent that recognition of unrealised gains or losses on available-for-sale securities causes adjustments to the carrying value and amortisation patterns of deferred acquisition costs and deferred income, these adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income to be consistent with the treatment of the gains or losses on the securities.
More precisely, shadow deferred acquisition costs adjustments reflect the change in deferred acquisition costs that would have arisen if the assets held in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising unrealised gains or losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.
UK insurance operations For UK regulated with-profits funds where the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA realistic regime is applied, the basis of setting liabilities is such that it would be inappropriate for acquisition costs to be deferred, therefore these costs are expensed as incurred.
The majority of the UK shareholder-backed business is individual and Group annuity business where the deferral of acquisition costs is negligible.
g  The Group performs adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amounts net of related deferred acquisition costs and, where relevant, present value of acquired in-force business is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash flows.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement.
h Earnedpremiums,  Premium and annuity considerations for conventional with-profits policies and other protection type insurance policies are recognised as revenue when due.
Premiums and annuity considerations for linked policies, unitised with-profits and other investment type policies are recognised as revenue when received or, in the case of unitised or unit-linked policies, when units are issued.
These amounts exclude premium taxes and similar duties where Prudential collects and settles taxes borne by the customer.
Policy fees charged on linked and unitised with-profits policies for mortality, asset management and policy administration are recognised as revenue when related services are provided.
Claims paid include maturities, annuities, surrenders and deaths.
Maturity claims are recorded as charges on the policy maturity date.
Annuity claims are recorded when each annuity instalment becomes due for payment.
Surrenders are charged to the income statement when paid and death claims are recorded when notified.
i Investmentreturn Investment return included in the income statement principally comprises interest income, dividends, investment appreciation depreciation realised and unrealised gains and losses on investments designated as fair value through profit or loss, and realised gains and losses including impairment losses on items held at amortised cost and Jacksons debt securities designated as available-for-sale.
Movements in unrealised appreciation depreciation of Jacksons debt securities designated as available-for-sale are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on investments.
Dividends on equity securities are recognised on the ex-dividend date and rental income is recognised on an accrual basis.
146 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information j  i  The Group holds financial investments in accordance with IAS 39, whereby subject to specific criteria, financial instruments are required to be accounted for under one of the following categories: Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss this comprises assets and liabilities designated by management as fair value through profit or loss on inception and derivatives that are held for trading.
These investments are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment return in the income statement: Financial investments on an available-for-sale basis this comprises assets that are designated by management as available-for-sale and or do not fall into any of the other categories.
These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs.
For available-for-sale debt securities, the difference between their cost and par value is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset: Available-for-sale assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
Interest income is recognised on an effective interest basis in the income statement.
Except for foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities, not in functional currency, which are included in the income statement, unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Upon disposal or impairment, accumulated unrealised gains and losses are transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement as realised gains or losses: and Loans and receivables except for those designated as at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale, these instruments comprise non-quoted investments that have fixed or determinable payments.
These instruments include loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits, loans to policyholders and other unsecured loans and receivables.
These investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Subsequently, these instruments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group uses the trade date method to account for regular purchases and sales of financial assets.
ii Useoffairvalue The Group uses current bid prices to value its investments with quoted prices.
Actively traded investments without quoted prices are valued using prices provided by third parties as described further in note C3.2.
If there is no active established market for an investment, the Group applies an appropriate valuation technique such as a discounted cash flow technique.
Determining the fair value of financial investments when the markets are not active The Group holds certain financial investments for which the markets are not active.
These can include financial investments which are not quoted on active markets and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions eg market illiquidity.
When the markets are not active, there is generally no or limited observable market data to account for financial investments at fair value.
The determination of whether an active market exists for a financial investment requires managements judgement.
If the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group establishes fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers or pricing services, or by using internally developed pricing models.
Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing and or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The valuation techniques include the use of recent arms-length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option-adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation and may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments.
Financial investments measured at fair value are classified into a three level hierarchy as described in note C3.2 b. www.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 147 A:  A3:  A3.1  iii  Available-for-sale securities The majority of Jacksons debt securities portfolio are accounted for on an available-for-sale basis.
The consideration of evidence of impairment requires managements judgement.
In making this determination the factors considered include, for example: Determiningfactors  Whether the decline of the A substantial decline in fair value might be indicative of a credit loss event that would lead to financial investments fair value a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows.

revised estimated cash flows The duration and extent to which This factor provides an indication of how the contractual cash flows and effective interest rate of a the amortised cost exceeds fair financial asset compares with the implicit market estimate of cash flows and the risk attaching to a fair value value measurement.
The length of time for which that level of difference has been in place may also provide further evidence as to whether the market assessment implies an impairment loss has arisen.
The financial condition and These factors and other observable conditions may indicate that an investment is impaired.
prospects of the issuer If a loss event that will have a detrimental effect on cash flows is identified, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The loss recognised is determined as the difference between the book cost and the fair value of the relevant impaired securities.
This loss comprises the effect of the expected loss of contractual cash flows and any additional market-price-driven temporary reductions in values.
For Jacksons residential mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale, the model used to analyse cash flows begins with the current delinquency experience of the underlying collateral pool for the structure, by applying assumptions about how much of the currently delinquent loans will eventually default, and multiplying this by an assumed loss severity.
Additional factors are applied to anticipate ageing effects.
After applying a cash flow simulation an indication is obtained as to whether or not the security has suffered, or is anticipated to suffer, contractual principal or interest payment shortfalls.
If a shortfall applies an impairment charge is recorded.
The difference between the fair value and book cost for unimpaired securities designated as available-for-sale is accounted for as unrealised gains or losses, with the movements unless impaired in the accounting period being included in other comprehensive income.
The Groups review of fair value involves several criteria, including economic conditions, credit loss experience, other issuer-specific developments and future cash flows.
These assessments are based on the best available information at the time.
Factors such as market liquidity, the widening of bid ask spreads and a change in cash flow assumptions can contribute to future price volatility.
If actual experience differs negatively from the assumptions and other considerations used in the consolidated financial statements, unrealised losses currently in equity may be recognised in the income statement in future periods.
Additional details on the impairments of the available-for-sale securities of Jackson are described in note C3.5 d. Assets held at amortised cost Financial assets classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39 are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The loans and receivables include loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits and loans to policyholders.
In estimating future cash flows, the Group looks at the expected cash flows of the assets and applies historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks that has been adjusted for conditions in the historical loss experience which no longer exist, or for conditions that are expected to arise.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted using the financial assets original or variable effective interest rate and exclude credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
The risks inherent in reviewing the impairment of any investment include: the risk that market results may differ from expectations: facts and circumstances may change in the future and differ from estimates and assumptions: or the Group may later decide to sell the asset as a result of changed circumstances.
Certain mortgage loans of the UK insurance operations and, consequent upon the purchase of REALIC in 2012 by Jackson, policy loans held to back funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements have been designated at fair value through profit or loss, as these loan portfolios are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.
Assets carried at cost or amortised cost are subject to impairment testing where appropriate under IFRS requirements.

iv  Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage investment, interest rate and currency exposures, to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.
The Group may designate certain derivatives as hedges.
For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of any change in fair value of derivatives or other financial instruments designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in the income statement.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly within the other comprehensive income of the foreign operation.
The Group does not regularly seek to apply fair value or cash flow hedging treatment under IAS 39.
The Group has no fair value and cash flows hedges under IAS 39 at 31 December 2015 and 2014.
All derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are carried at fair value with movements in fair value being recorded in the income statement.
The primary areas of the Groups continuing operations where derivative instruments are held are the UK with-profits funds and annuity business, and Jackson.
For UK with-profits funds the derivative programme is used for the purposes of efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risk.
For shareholder-backed UK annuity business the derivatives are held to contribute to the matching as far as practical, of asset returns and duration with those of liabilities to policyholders.
The carrying value of these liabilities is sensitive to the return on the matching financial assets including derivatives held.
For Jackson, an extensive derivative programme is maintained.
Value movements on the derivatives held can be very significant in their effect on shareholder results.
Further details on this aspect of the Groups financial reporting are described in note B1.2.
v  The policies for these items are significant factors in contributing to the volatility of the income statement result and shareholders equity.
Under IAS 39, derivatives are required to be carried at fair value.
Unless net investment hedge accounting is applied, value movements on derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
For derivative instruments of Jackson that are entered into to mitigate economic exposures, the Group has considered whether it is appropriate to undertake the necessary operational changes to qualify for hedge accounting so as to achieve matching of value movements in hedging instruments and hedged items in the performance statements.
In reaching the decision a number of factors were particularly relevant.
These were: IAS 39 hedging criteria have been designed primarily in the context of hedging and hedging instruments that are assessable as financial instruments that are either stand-alone or separable from host contracts, rather than, for example, duration characteristics of insurance contracts: The high hurdle levels under IAS 39 of ensuring hedge effectiveness at the level of individual hedge transactions: The difficulties in applying the macro hedge provisions under IAS 39 which are more suited to banking arrangements to Jacksons derivative book: The complexity of asset and liability matching of US life insurers such as those with Jacksons product range: and finally Whether it is possible or desirable, without an unacceptable level of costs and constraint on commercial activity, to achieve the accounting hedge effectiveness required under IAS 39.
Taking account of these considerations, the Group has decided that, except for occasional circumstances, it is not appropriate to seek to achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39.
As a result of this decision, the total income statement results are more volatile as the movements in the value of Jacksons derivatives are reflected within it.
This volatility is reflected in the level of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, as shown in notes B1.1 and B1.2.
Under IAS 39, unless carried at amortised cost subject to impairment provisions where appropriate under the held-to-maturity category, debt securities are also carried at fair value.
The Group has chosen not to classify any financial assets as held-to-maturity.
Debt securities of Jackson are designated as available-for-sale with value movements, unless impaired, being recorded as movements within other comprehensive income.
Impairments are recorded in the income statement.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 149 A:  A3:  A3.1  vi Embeddedderivatives Embedded derivatives are present in host contracts issued by various Group companies, in particular Jackson.
They are embedded within other non-derivative host financial instruments and insurance contracts to create hybrid instruments.
Embedded derivatives meeting the definition of an insurance contract are accounted for under IFRS 4.
Where economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host instrument, and where the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and carried at fair value as a derivative in accordance with IAS 39.
For Jacksons not for life Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Fixed Index Annuity reserves the determination of fair value requires assumptions regarding future mix of Separate Account assets, equity volatility levels, and policyholder behaviour.
In addition, the Group applies the option under IFRS 4 to not separate and fair value surrender options embedded in host contracts and with-profits investment contracts whose strike price is either a fixed amount or a fixed amount plus interest.
Further details on the valuation basis for embedded derivatives attaching to Jacksons life assurance contracts are provided in note C4.2.
vii  The Group is party to various securities lending agreements including repurchase agreements under which securities are loaned to third parties on a short-term basis.
The loaned securities are not derecognised: rather, they continue to be recognised within the appropriate investment classification.
The Groups policy is that collateral in excess of 100 per cent of the fair value of securities loaned is required from all securities borrowers and typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities or letters of credit.
In cases where the Group takes possession of the collateral under its securities lending programme, the collateral, and corresponding obligation to return such collateral, are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group is also party to various reverse repurchase agreements under which securities are purchased from third parties with an obligation to resell the securities.
The securities are not recognised as investments in the statement of financial position.
viii  The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
ix  Consistent with the Groups risk management and investment strategy and the nature of the products concerned, the Group has designated under IAS 39 classification certain financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as these instruments are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.
These instruments include liabilities related to consolidated collateralised debt obligations and net assets attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
k  The total tax charge for the Group reflects tax that, in addition to relating to shareholders profits, is also attributable to policyholders and unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and unit-linked policies.
This is explained in more detail in note B5.
Reported profit before the total tax charge is not representative of pre-tax profits attributable to shareholders.
Accordingly, in order to provide a measure of pre-tax profits attributable to shareholders the Group has chosen to adopt an income statement presentation of the tax charge and pre-tax results that distinguishes between policyholder and shareholder components.
l Segments Under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is internally provided to the Group Executive Committee which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The operating segments identified by the Group reflect the Groups organisational structure, which is by both geography Asia, US and UK and by product line insurance operations and asset management.
The products of the insurance operations contain both significant and insignificant levels of insurance risk.
The products are managed together and there is no distinction between these two categories other than for accounting purposes.
This segment also includes the commission earned on general insurance business and investment subsidiaries held to support the Groups insurance operations.
Asset management comprises both internal and third-party asset management services, inclusive of portfolio and mutual fund management, where the Group acts as an adviser, and broker-dealer activities.
The nature of the products and the managing of the business differ from the risks inherent in the insurance operations segments, and the regulatory environment of the asset management industry differs from that of the insurance operations segments.
Further information on the Groups operating segments is provided in note B1.3.
150 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information m  The Group uses operating profit based on longer-term investment returns as the segmental measure of its results.
The basis of calculation is disclosed in note B1.3.
For shareholder-backed business, with the exception of debt securities held by Jackson and assets classified as loans and receivables at amortised cost, all financial investments and investment property are designated as assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The short-term fluctuations affect the result for the year and the Group provides additional analysis of results before and after the effects of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, together with other items that are of a short-term, volatile or one-off nature.
The effects of short-term fluctuations include asymmetric impacts where the measurement bases of the liabilities and associated derivatives used to manage the Jackson annuity business differ as described in note B1.2.
Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on assets held by with-profits fund, do not affect directly reported shareholder results.
This is because i the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds is accounted for as a liability and ii excess or deficits of income and expenditure of the funds over the required surplus for distribution are transferred to or from unallocated surplus.
n Borrowings Although initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, borrowings, excluding liabilities of consolidated collateralised debt obligations, are subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds net of related issue costs is amortised through the income statement to the date of maturity or for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
o Investmentproperties Investments in leasehold and freehold properties not for occupation by the Group, including properties under development for future use as investment properties, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
Properties are valued annually either by the Groups qualified surveyors or by taking into consideration the advice of professional external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards.
Each property is externally valued at least once every three years.
Leases of investment property where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases leasehold property.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
p Pensionschemes For the Groups defined benefit schemes, if the present value of the defined benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the scheme assets, then a liability is recorded in the Groups statement of financial position.
By contrast, if the fair value of the assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation then the surplus will only be recognised if the nature of the arrangements under the trust deed, and funding arrangements between the Trustee and the Company, support the availability of refunds or recoverability through agreed reductions in future contributions.
In addition, if there is a constructive obligation for the Company to pay deficit funding, this is also recognised such that the financial position recorded for the scheme reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and the obligation for deficit funding.
The Group utilises the projected unit credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
This method sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high-quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The plan assets of the Groups pension schemes include several insurance contracts that have been issued by the Group.
These assets are excluded from plan assets in determining the pension surplus or deficit recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset at the start of the period, is charged to the income statement.
Actuarial and other gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions or experience variances are recognised as other comprehensive income.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution schemes are expensed when due.
q  The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
Shares held in trust relating to these plans are conditionally gifted to employees.
The compensation expense charged to the income statement is primarily based upon the fair value of the options granted, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.
The Company has established trusts to facilitate the delivery of Prudential plc shares under employee incentive plans and savings-related share option schemes.
The cost to the Company of acquiring these treasury shares held in trusts is shown as a deduction from shareholders equity.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 151 A:  A3:  A3.1  r Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years.
Prudential is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the total tax charge inherently involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
The positions taken in tax returns where applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are recognised in full in the determination of the tax charge in the financial statements if the Group considers that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept those positions.
Otherwise, provisions are established based on managements estimate and judgement of the likely amount of the liability, or recovery.
The total tax charge includes tax expense attributable to both policyholders and shareholders.
The tax expense attributable to policyholders comprises the tax on the income of the consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds.
In certain jurisdictions, such as the UK, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders profits and on their policyholders insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products.
Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Groups consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the consolidated income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.
Deferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences.
IAS 12 Income Taxes does not require all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
s  Business acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, which adjusts the net assets of the acquired company to fair value at the date of purchase.
The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill.
Expenses related to acquiring new subsidiaries are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Income and expenses of acquired entities are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Income and expenses of entities sold during the period are included in the income statement up to the date of disposal.
The gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between sale proceeds net of selling costs, less the net assets of the entity at the date of disposal adjusted for foreign exchange movements attaching to the sold entity that are required to be recycled to the income statement under IAS 21. t Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised and carried on the Group statement of financial position as an intangible asset at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill impairment testing is conducted annually and when there is an indication of impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units.
u Intangibleassets Intangible assets acquired on the purchase of a subsidiary or portfolio of contracts are measured at fair value on acquisition.
Deferred acquisition costs are accounted for as described in notes A3.1 d and A3.1 f above.
Other intangible assets, such as distribution rights and software, are valued initially at the price paid to acquire them and are subsequently carried at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Distribution rights relate to fees paid under bancassurance partnership arrangements for bank distribution of products for the term of the contract.
Amounts for distribution rights are amortised on a basis to reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by reference to new business production levels.
The same principles apply to determining the amortisation method for other intangible assets unless the pattern cannot be determined reliably, in which case a straight-line method is applied.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the acquisition costs and other expenditure line in the consolidated income statement.
v  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term highly liquid investments with less than 90 days maturity from the date of acquisition.
w  Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
x Sharecapital Where there is no obligation to transfer assets, shares are classified as equity.
The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued, is credited to share premium.
Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from retained earnings.
Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to retained earnings net of related costs.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information y Foreignexchange The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the Groups presentation currency.
Accordingly, the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries must be translated into the presentation currency of the Group from their functional currencies, ie the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are converted at year end exchange rates while all income and expenses are converted at average exchange rates where this is a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on transaction dates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded as a separate component in the statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency borrowings that are used to provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates and movements recognised in other comprehensive income.
Other foreign currency monetary items are translated at year end exchange rates with changes recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the spot rate prevailing at the time.
z Earningspershare Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in employee share trusts and consolidated unit trusts and OEICs, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Groups only class of potentially dilutive ordinary shares are those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
No adjustment is made if the impact is anti-dilutive overall.
A3.2  The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued but are not yet effective in 2015, including those which have not yet been adopted in the EU.
This is not intended to be a complete list as only those standards, interpretations and amendments that could have an impact upon the Groups financial statements are discussed.
   The amendments published in May 2014 provide additional guidance on how the depreciation or amortisation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets should be calculated.
They are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with earlier application being permitted.
The Group has assessed the impact of the amendments and determined that they are not likely to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
 The annual improvements 2012-2014 Cycle include minor changes to four IFRSs, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
The Group is assessing the impact of these amendments but they are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
  In December 2014, the IASB published Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 1.
The amendments aim at clarifying, rather than significantly changing, IAS 1 to address perceived impediments to preparers exercising their judgement in presenting their financial reports.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and clarify materiality requirements, aggregation of specific line items in the financial statements and ordering of the notes.
We have reviewed the amendments and do not envisage any significant change.
 This standard effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, provides a single framework to recognise revenue from contracts with different characteristics and overrides the framework provided for such contracts in other standards.
The contracts excluded from the scope of this standard include: Lease contracts within the scope of IAS 17 Leases: Insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: and Financial instruments within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
As a result of the scope exclusion above, this standard is of particular relevance only to the revenue recognition of the Groups asset management contracts and the measurement of the Groups investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features where the contracts include an investment management element.
The Group is assessing the impact of this standard but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 153 A:  A3:  A3.2  IFRS16Leases In January 2016, the IASB published a new standard, IFRS 16 Leases.
The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases.
Lessor accounting however remains largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and finance leases is retained.
IFRS 16 is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has also been applied.
The Group is assessing the impact of this standard.
: In July 2014, the IASB published a complete version of IFRS 9 with the exception of macro hedge accounting.
The standard becomes mandatorily effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted and transitional rules apply.
In December 2015, the IASB published for consultation an exposure draft of proposed amendments to IFRS 4 to address the temporary consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and the new insurance contracts standard.
The proposals in the exposure draft includes an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 that would be available to companies whose predominant activity is to issue insurance contracts.
Such a deferral would be available until the new Insurance Contracts Standard comes into effect but it could not be used after 1 January 2021.
The comment period closed on 8 February 2016.
This standard replaces the existing IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement, and will affect: The classification and the measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
Under IFRS 9, financial assets are classified under one of the following categories: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI and fair value through profit or loss FVTPL based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and or the business model in which they are held.
The existing amortised cost measurement for financial liabilities is largely maintained under IFRS 9 but for financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, changes in fair value due to changes in entitys own credit risk are to be recognised in other comprehensive income: The calculation of the impairment charge relevant for financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI.
A new impairment model based on an expected credit loss approach replaces the existing IAS 39 incurred loss impairment model: and The hedge accounting requirements which are more closely aligned with the risk management activities of the Company.
The Group is assessing the impact of this standard in conjunction with the requirements of the IASBs proposals for insurance contracts accounting as they are developed to a final standard.
The adoption of the requirements of IFRS 9 may result in reclassification of certain of the Groups financial assets and hence lead to a change in the measurement of these instruments or the performance reporting of value movements.
In addition, for any investments classified as FVOCI, as noted above, the impairment provisioning approach is altered from the current IAS 39 approach.
The Group does not currently apply hedge accounting for most of its derivative programmes but will reconsider its approach in light of new requirements under the standard on adoption.

Prior to 2015, the Group incorporated Prudential Capital into the M&G operating segment for the purposes of segment reporting.
To better reflect the economic characteristics of the two businesses, the Group has in 2015 made a change to present Prudential Capital as a separate reportable segment rather than aggregating this segment within M&G.
Performancemeasure The performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Company is IFRS operating profit attributable to shareholders based on longer-term investment returns, as described below.
This measurement basis distinguishes operating profit based on long-term investment returns from other constituents of the total profit as follows: Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business : Gain on the sale of the Groups stake in the PruHealth and PruProtect businesses in 2014: Amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business.
This comprises principally the charge for the adjustments arising on the purchase of REALIC in 2012: The recycling of the cumulative exchange translation loss on the sold Japan life business from other comprehensive income to the income statement in 2015.
See note D1 for further details: and The costs associated with the domestication of the Hong Kong branch which became effective on 1 January 2014.
Segment results that are reported to the Group Executive Committee include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items are mainly in relation to the Group Head Office and the Asia Regional Head Office.
: a Generalprinciples i UK style with-profits business The operating profit based on longer-term returns reflects the statutory transfer gross of attributable tax.
Value movements in the underlying assets of the with-profits funds do not affect directly the determination of operating profit.
ii Unit-linked business The policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the underlying asset value movements.
Accordingly, the operating results based on longer-term investment returns reflect the current period value movements in both the unit liabilities and the backing assets.
iii US variable annuity and fixed index annuity business This business has guarantee liabilities which are measured on a combination of fair value and other US GAAP derived principles.
These liabilities are subject to an extensive derivative programme to manage equity and, with those of the general account, interest rate exposures.
The principles for determination of the operating profit and short-term fluctuations are necessarily bespoke, as discussed in section c below.
iv Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions Under IFRS, the degree to which the carrying values of liabilities to policyholders are sensitive to current market conditions varies between territories depending upon the nature of the grandfathered measurement basis.
In general, in those instances where the liabilities are particularly sensitive to routine changes in market conditions, the accounting basis is such that the impact of market movements on the assets and liabilities is broadly equivalent in the income statement, and operating profit based on longer-term investments returns is not distorted.
In these circumstances, there is no need for the movement in the liability to be bifurcated between the elements that relate to longer-term market conditions and short-term effects.
However, some types of business movements in liabilities do require bifurcation to ensure that at the net level ie after allocated investment return and charge for policyholder benefits the operating result reflects longer-term market returns.
Examples of where such bifurcation is necessary are in Hong Kong and for UK shareholder-backed annuity business, as explained in sections b i and d i, respectively.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information v Other shareholder-financed business The measurement of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflects the particular features of long-term insurance business where assets and liabilities are held for the long-term and for which the accounting basis for insurance liabilities under current IFRS is not generally conducive to demonstrating trends in underlying performance of life businesses exclusive of the effects of shortterm fluctuations in market conditions.
In determining the profit on this basis, the following key elements are applied to the results of the Groups shareholder-financed operations.
Except in the case of assets backing liabilities which are directly matched such as linked business or closely correlated with value movements as discussed below operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for shareholder-financed business is determined on the basis of expected longer-term investment returns.
Debt, equity-type securities and loans Longer-term investment returns comprise actual income receivable for the period interest dividend income and for both debt and equity-type securities longer-term capital returns.
In principle, for debt securities and loans, the longer-term capital returns comprise two elements: Risk margin reserve based charge for the expected level of defaults for the period, which is determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio.
The difference between impairment losses in the reporting period and the risk margin reserve charge to the operating result is reflected in short-term fluctuations in investment returns: and The amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses to operating results based on longer-term investment returns to the date when sold bonds would have otherwise matured.
At 31 December 2015, the level of unamortised interest-related realised gains and losses related to previously sold bonds for the Group was a net gain of 567 million 2014: 467 million.
Equity type securities For equity-type securities, the longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term trend investment returns for income and capital having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations.
Equity-type securities held for shareholder-financed operations other than the UK annuity business, unit-linked and US variable annuity are of significance for the US and Asia insurance operations.
Different rates apply to different categories of equity-type securities.
Derivative value movements Generally, derivative value movements are excluded from operating results based on longer-term investment returns unless those derivative value movements broadly offset changes in the accounting value of other assets and liabilities included in operating profit.
The principal example of non-equity based derivatives for example interest rate swaps and swaptions whose value movements are excluded from operating profit arises in Jackson, as discussed below in section c. b  i Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions For certain Asia non-participating business, for example in Hong Kong, the economic features are more akin to asset management products with policyholder liabilities reflecting asset shares over the contract term.
For these products, the charge for policyholder benefits in the operating results should reflect the asset share feature rather than volatile movements that would otherwise be reflected if the local regulatory basis also applied for IFRS basis was used.
For certain other types of non-participating business, longer-term interest rates are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining operating results.
ii Other Asia shareholder-financed business Debt securities For this business the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
Accordingly, all realised gains and losses to date for these operations are being amortised over the period to the date those securities would otherwise have matured, with no explicit risk margin reserve charge.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 159 B:  B1:  B1.3  Equity-type securities For Asia insurance operations, investments in equity securities held for non-linked shareholder-financed operations amounted to 840 million as at 31 December 2015 2014: 932 million.
The rates of return applied in the years 2015 and 2014 ranged from 2.73 per cent to 13.75 per cent with the rates applied varying by territory.
These rates are determined after consideration by the Groups in-house economists of long-term expected real government bond returns, equity risk premium and long-term inflation.
These rates are broadly stable from period to period but may be different between countries reflecting, for example, differing expectations of inflation in each territory.
The assumptions are for returns expected to apply in equilibrium conditions.
The assumed rates of return do not reflect any cyclical variability in economic performance and are not set by reference to prevailing asset valuations.
The longer-term investment returns for the Asia insurance joint ventures accounted for using the equity method are determined on a similar basis as the other Asia insurance operations described above.
c  i Separate account business For such business the policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the asset value movements.
Accordingly, the operating results based on longer-term investment returns reflect the current period value movements in unit liabilities and the backing assets.
ii US variable and fixed index annuity business The following value movements for Jacksons variable and fixed index annuity business are excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
See note B1.2 note ii : Fair value movements for equity-based derivatives: Fair value movements for embedded derivatives for the not for life portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and fixed index annuity business, and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit reinsurance see below : Movements in the accounts carrying value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and the for life portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liabilities, for which, under the grandfathered US GAAP applied under IFRS for Jacksons insurance assets and liabilities, the measurement basis gives rise to a muted impact of current period market movements: A portion of the fee assessments as well as claim payments, in respect of guarantee liabilities: and Related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs for each of the above items.
Embedded derivatives for variable annuity guarantee minimum income benefit The Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability, which is essentially fully reinsured, subject to a deductible and annual claim limits, is accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 944-80 Financial Services Insurance Separate Accounts formerly SOP 03-1 under IFRS using grandfathered US GAAP.
As the corresponding reinsurance asset is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and the asset is therefore recognised at fair value.
As the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit is economically reinsured, the mark to market element of the reinsurance asset is included as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
iii Other derivative value movements The principal example of non-equity based derivatives for example, interest rate swaps and swaptions whose value movements are excluded from operating profit, arises in Jackson.
Non-equity based derivatives are primarily held by Jackson as part of a broadly-based hedging programme for features of Jacksons bond portfolio for which value movements are booked in the statement of comprehensive income rather than the income statement, product liabilities for which US GAAP accounting as grandfathered under IFRS 4 does not fully reflect the economic features being hedged, and the interest rate exposure attaching to equity-based embedded derivatives.
iv Other US shareholder-financed business Debt securities Jackson is the shareholder-backed operation for which the distinction between impairment losses and interest-related realised gains and losses is in practice relevant to a significant extent.
Jackson has used the ratings by Nationally Recognised Statistical Ratings Organisations NRSRO or ratings resulting from the regulatory ratings detail issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC developed by external third parties such as BlackRock Solutions to determine the average annual risk margin reserve to apply to debt securities held to back general account business.
Debt securities held to back separate account and reinsurance funds withheld are not subject to risk margin reserve charge.
Further details of the risk margin reserve charge, as well as the amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses, for Jackson are shown in note B1.2.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Equity-type securities As at 31 December 2015, the equity-type securities for US insurance non-separate account operations amounted to 1,004 million 2014: 1,094 million.
For these operations, the longer-term rates of return for income and capital applied in 2015 and 2014, which reflect the combination of the average risk-free rates over the period and appropriate risk premiums are as follows: 2015 2014 Equity-type securities such as common and preferred stock and portfolio holdings in mutual funds 5.7% to 6.4% 6.2% to 6.7% Other equity-type securities such as investments in limited partnerships and private equity funds 7.7% to 8.4% 8.2% to 8.7% d  i Shareholder-backed annuity business For this business, policyholder liabilities are determined by reference to current interest rates.
The value movements of the assets covering liabilities are closely correlated with the related change in liabilities.
Accordingly, asset value movements are recorded within the operating results based on longer-term investment returns.
Policyholder liabilities include a margin for credit risk.
Variations between actual and best estimate expected impairments are recorded as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
The operating result based on longer-term investment returns reflects the impact of value movements on policyholder liabilities for annuity business in PRIL and the PAC non-profit sub-fund after adjustments to allocate the following elements of the movement to the category of short-term fluctuations in investment returns: The impact on credit risk provisioning of actual upgrades and downgrades during the period: Credit experience compared to assumptions: and Short-term value movements on assets backing the capital of the business.
Credit experience reflects the impact of defaults and other similar experience, such as asset exchanges arising from debt restructuring by issuers that include effectively an element of permanent impairment of the security held.
Positive or negative experience compared to assumptions is included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns without further adjustment.
The effects of other changes to credit risk provisioning are included in the operating result, as is the net effect of changes to the valuation rate of interest due to portfolio rebalancing to align more closely with management benchmark.
ii Non-linked shareholder-financed business For debt securities backing non-linked shareholder-financed business of the UK insurance operations other than the annuity business the realised gains and losses are principally interest-related.
e  For these businesses, the particular features applicable for life assurance noted above do not apply.
For these businesses it is inappropriate to include returns in the operating result on the basis described above.
Instead, it is appropriate to generally include realised gains and losses in the operating result with temporary unrealised gains and losses being included in short-term fluctuations.
In some instances it may also be appropriate to amortise realised gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments to operating results over a time period that reflects the underlying economic substance of the arrangements.

The compensation costs for all awards and options are recognised in net income over the plans respective vesting periods.
The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to value all options and awards other than the Prudential LTIP TSR for which the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of the LTIP TSR performance conditions.
These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and exercise prices.
For all options and awards, the expected volatility is based on the market implied volatilities as quoted on Bloomberg.
The Prudential specific at-the-money implied volatilities are adjusted to allow for the different terms and discounted exercise price on SAYE options by using information on the volatility surface of the FTSE 100.
Risk-free interest rates are taken from government bond spot rates with projections for two-year, three-year and five-year terms to match corresponding vesting periods.
Dividend yield is determined as the average yield over a period of 12 months up to and including the date of grant.
For the Prudential LTIP TSR, volatility and correlation between Prudential and a basket of 18 competitor companies is required.
For grants in 2015, the average volatility for the basket of competitors was 20.66 per cent.
Correlations for the basket are calculated for each pairing from the log of daily TSR returns for the three years prior to the valuation date.
Market implied volatilities are used for both Prudential and the components of the index.
Changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.

 During 2015 the UK insurance operations entered into additional longevity reinsurance transactions to extend total coverage from 2.3 billion of annuity liabilities at the start of the year to 8.7 billion at the end of 2015 on a Pillar 1 basis.
Overall these transactions generated profit of 231 million 2014: 30 million.
Of the 231 million, 170 million relates to transactions undertaken in the second half of 2015 covering 4.8 billion of annuity liabilities on a Pillar 1 basis.
These transactions, together with other specific management actions undertaken to position the balance sheet more efficiently under the new Solvency II regime, gave rise to IFRS operating profit in the second half of 2015 of 339 million in total, which is not expected to recur in future periods.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 195 C:  C3:  C3.2  a  The fair values of the assets and liabilities of the Group as shown in this note have been determined on the following bases.
The fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS are determined by the use of current market bid prices for exchange-quoted investments or by using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques.
The estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arms length transaction.
This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.
The loans and receivables have been shown net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans have been estimated from discounted cash flows expected to be received.
The rate of discount used was the market rate of interest where applicable.
The fair value of investment properties is based on market values as assessed by professionally qualified external valuers or by the Groups qualified surveyors.
The fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.
The fair value of financial liabilities other than derivative financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flows of the amounts expected to be paid.
b  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the statement of financial position The table on the next page shows the assets and liabilities carried at fair value analysed by level of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defined fair value hierarchy.
This hierarchy is based on the inputs to the fair value measurement and reflects the lowest level input that is significant to that measurement.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 199 C:  C3:  C3.2  c  A significant proportion of the Groups level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other non-national government debt securities.
These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using independent pricing services or third-party broker quotes.
These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.
Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes.
Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced directly from brokers.
Prudential seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available on their executability.
Where quotes are sourced directly from brokers, the price used in the valuation is normally selected from one of the quotes based on a number of factors, including the timeliness and regularity of the quotes and the accuracy of the quotes considering the spreads provided.
The selected quote is the one which best represents an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.
Generally, no adjustment is made to the prices obtained from independent third parties.
Adjustment is made in only limited circumstances, where it is determined that the third-party valuations obtained do not reflect fair value eg either because the value is stale and or the values are extremely diverse in range.
These are usually securities which are distressed or that could be subject to a debt restructure or where reliable market prices are no longer available due to an inactive market or market dislocation.
In these instances, prices are derived using internal valuation techniques including those as described below in this note with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The techniques used require a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Examples of such variables include an average credit spread based on the corporate bond universe and the relevant duration of the asset being valued.
Prudential determines the input assumptions based on the best available information at the measurement dates.
Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Of the total level 2 debt securities of 104,464 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 107,731 million, 10,331 million are valued internally 2014: 10,093 million.
The majority of such securities are valued using matrix pricing, which is based on assessing the credit quality of the underlying borrower to derive a suitable discount rate relative to government securities of a comparable duration.
Under matrix pricing, the debt securities are priced taking the credit spreads on comparable quoted public debt securities and applying these to the equivalent debt instruments factoring in a specified liquidity premium.
The majority of the parameters used in this valuation technique are readily observable in the market and, therefore, are not subject to interpretation.

Valuation approach for level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities Financial instruments at fair value Investments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which by their nature do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions, eg market illiquidity.
The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.
These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments.
When determining the inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties.
Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Groups entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued.
In some cases the disclosed value cannot be realised in immediate settlement of the financial instrument.
In accordance with the Groups risk management framework, the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties valuations.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held 4,108 million 2014: 3,760 million of net financial instruments at fair value within level 3.
This represents 1 per cent 2014: 1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of fair valued financial liabilities.
Included within these amounts were loans of 2,183 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 2,025 million, measured as the loan outstanding balance, attached to REALIC and held to back the liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements.
The funds withheld liability of 2,347 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 2,201 million was also classified within level 3, accounted for on a fair value basis being equivalent to the carrying value of the underlying assets.
202 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Excluding the loans and funds withheld liability under REALICs reinsurance arrangements as described above, which amounted to a net liability of 164 million 2014: 176 million, the level 3 fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities were 4,272 million 2014: 3,936 million.
Of this amount, a net liability of 77 million 2014: net asset of 11 million was internally valued, representing less than 0.1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities 2014: less than 0.1 per cent.
Internal valuations are inherently more subjective than external valuations.
Included within these internally valued net asset liability were: a Debt securities of 381 million 2014: 298 million, which were either valued on a discounted cash flow method with an internally developed discount rate or on external prices adjusted to reflect the specific known conditions relating to these securities eg distressed securities or securities which were being restructured.
b Private equity and venture investments of 852 million 2014: 1,002 million which were valued internally based on management information available for these investments.
These investments were principally held by consolidated investment funds which are managed on behalf of third parties.
c Liabilities of 1,013 million 2014: 1,269 million for the net asset value attributable to external unit holders in respect of the consolidated investment funds, which are non-recourse to the Group.
These liabilities are valued by reference to the underlying assets.
d Derivative liabilities of 353 million 2014: 23 million which are valued internally using standard market practices but are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
e Other sundry individual financial investments of 56 million 2014: 3 million.
Of the internally valued net liability referred to above of 77 million 2014: net asset of 11 million : a A net asset of 29 million 2014: net liability of 133 million was held by the Groups participating funds and therefore shareholders profit and equity are not impacted by movements in the valuation of these financial instruments.
b A net liability of 106 million 2014: net asset of 144 million was held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business.
If the value of all the level 3 instruments held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business valued internally was varied downwards by 10 per cent, the change in valuation would be 11 million 2014: 14 million, which would reduce shareholders equity by this amount before tax.
Of this amount, a decrease of 10 million 2014: a decrease of 13 million would pass through the income statement substantially as part of short-term fluctuations in investment returns outside of operating profit and a 1 million decrease 2014: a decrease of 1 million would be included as part of other comprehensive income, being unrealised movements on assets classified as available-for-sale.
Other assets at fair value investment properties The investment properties of the Group are principally held by the UK insurance operations which are externally valued by professionally qualified external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS valuation standards.
An income capitalisation technique is predominantly applied for these properties.
This technique calculates the value through the yield and rental value depending on factors such as the lease length, building quality, covenant and location.
The variables used are compared to recent transactions with similar features to those of the Groups investment properties.
As the comparisons are not with properties which are virtually identical to Groups investment properties, adjustments are made by the valuers where appropriate to the variables used.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of the properties.
e  The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of levels as of the end of each half year reporting period except for material transfers which are recognised as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
During 2015, the transfers between levels within the Groups portfolio were primarily transfers from level 1 to level 2 of 648 million and transfers from level 2 to level 1 of 283 million.
These transfers which relate to equity securities and debt securities arose to reflect the change in the observability of the inputs used in valuing these securities.
In addition, in 2015, the transfers into level 3 were 136 million and the transfers out of level 3 were 92 million.
These transfers were between levels 3 and 2 and primarily for equity securities and debt securities.
f  The Groups valuation policies, procedures and analyses for instruments categorised as level 3 are overseen by Business Unit committees as part of the Groups wider financial reporting governance processes.
The procedures undertaken include approval of valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues.
In undertaking these activities the Group makes use of the extensive expertise of its asset management functions.

Where available, quoted market prices are used.
However, where securities do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades or where markets for the securities are no longer active as a result of market conditions, IAS 39 requires that valuation techniques be applied.
IFRS 13 requires classification of the fair values applied by the Group into a three-level hierarchy.
At 31 December 2015, 0.1 per cent of Jacksons debt securities were classified as level 3 31 December 2014: 0.1 per cent comprising of fair values where there are significant inputs which are not based on observable market data.
Except for certain assets covering liabilities that are measured at fair value, the debt securities of the US insurance operations are classified as available-for-sale.
Unless impaired, fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Realised gains and losses, including impairments, recorded in the income statement are as shown in note B1.2 of this report.
Movements in unrealised gains and losses on available-for-sale securities There was a movement in the statement of financial position value for debt securities classified as available-for-sale from a net unrealised gain of 1,840 million to a net unrealised gain of 592 million as analysed in the table below.
This decrease reflects the effects of increasing long-term interest rates and credit spreads.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 213 C:  C3:  C3.5  The majority of derivative assets and liabilities have been included at fair value within the one year or less column, representing the basis on which they are managed ie to manage principally asset or liability value exposures.
The Group has no cash flow hedges and in general, contractual maturities are not considered essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows for these instruments.
The only exception is certain identified interest rate swaps which are fully expected to be held until maturity solely for the purposes of matching cash flows on separately held assets and liabilities.
For these instruments the undiscounted cash flows including contractual interest amounts due to be paid under the swap contract assuming conditions are consistent with those at year end are included in the column relating to the contractual maturity of the derivative.
Maturity analysis of investment contracts The table below shows the maturity profile for investment contracts on undiscounted cash flow projections of expected benefit payments.
bn Total After1 After5 After10 After15 undisTotal 1year yearto yearsto yearsto yearsto Over counted carrying orless 5years 10years 15years 20years 20years value value 2015 6 21 19 14 10 9 79 55 2014 6 19 18 13 10 8 74 59 Most investment contracts have options to surrender early, often subject to surrender or other penalties.
Therefore, most contracts can be said to have a contractual maturity of less than one year, but in reality the additional charges and term of the contracts mean these are unlikely to be exercised in practice and the more useful information is to present information on expected payment.
The maturity profile above excludes certain corporate unit-linked business with gross policyholder liabilities of 11 billion 2014: 13 billion which have no stated maturity but which are repayable on demand.
The vast majority of the Groups financial assets are held to back the Groups policyholder liabilities.
Although asset liability matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities both those classified as insurance and those classified as investments, this profile is mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk.
Within each business unit this asset liability matching is performed on a  basis.
In terms of liquidity risk, a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, meaning that many of the Groups liabilities are expected to be held for the long term.
Much of the Groups investment portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets.
For the reasons above, an analysis of the Groups assets by contractual maturity is not considered appropriate to evaluate the nature and extent of the Groups liquidity risk.
ii Credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk of financial instruments before any allowance for collateral or allocation of losses to policyholders is represented by the carrying value of financial instruments on the balance sheet that have exposures to credit risk comprising cash and cash equivalents, deposits, debt securities, loans and derivative assets, and other debtors, the carrying value of which are disclosed at the start of this note and note 3.5 b below for derivative assets.
The collateral in place in relation to derivatives is described in note C3.5 c below.
Note C3.4, describes the security for these loans held by the Group.
Of the total loans and receivables held, 27 million 2014: 11 million are past their due date but are not impaired.
Of the total past due but not impaired, 22 million are less than one year past their due date 2014: 5 million.
The Group expects full recovery of these loans and receivables.
No further analysis has been provided of the element of loans and receivables that was neither past due nor impaired for the total portfolio on the grounds of immateriality of the difference between the neither past due nor impaired elements and the total portfolio.
Financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated amounted to 16 million 2014: 13 million.
In addition, during 2015 and 2014 the Group did not take possession of any other collateral held as security.
Further details of collateral and pledges are provided in note C3.5 c below.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information iii Foreign exchange risk As at 31 December 2015, the Group held 22 per cent 2014: 22 per cent and 11 per cent 2014: 9 per cent of its financial assets and financial liabilities respectively, in currencies, mainly US dollar and Euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit.
Of these financial assets, 53 per cent 2014: 56 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, allowing the fund to obtain exposure to foreign equity markets.
Of these financial liabilities, 40 per cent 2014: 47 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, mainly relating to foreign currency borrowings.
The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts note 3.5 b below.
The amount of exchange gain recognised in the income statement in 2015, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, is 138 million 2014: 89 million gain.
This constitutes 1 million loss 2014: 1 million loss on Medium Term Notes liabilities and 139 million of net gain 2014: 90 million net gain, mainly arising on investments of the PAC with-profits fund.
The gains losses on Medium Term Notes liabilities are fully offset by value movements on cross-currency swaps, which are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
b  Derivatives The Group enters into a variety of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, including futures, options, forward currency contracts and swaps such as interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, swaptions and credit default swaps.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions, with the exception of some Asia transactions, are conducted under standardised ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc master agreements and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
The total fair value balances of derivative assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2015 were as follows: 2015 m Asia US UK insurance insurance insurance Asset Unallocated Group operations operations operations management toasegment total Derivative assets 57 905 1,930 65 1 2,958 Derivative liabilities 140 249 2,125 283 322 3,119 83 656 195 218 321 161 2014 m Derivative assets 47 916 2,344 103 2 3,412 Derivative liabilities 143 251 1,381 233 315 2,323 96 665 963 130 313 1,089 The derivative assets are included in other investments in the statement of financial position and are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective and efficient management of exposure to various markets in accordance with the Groups investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks.
The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
In particular: UK with-profits funds use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risks.
For UK annuity business derivatives are used to assist with asset and liability cash flow matching: US operations and some of the UK operations hold large amounts of interest-rate sensitive investments that contain credit risks on which a certain level of default is expected.
These businesses have purchased some swaptions to manage the default risk on certain underlying assets and hence reduce the amount of regulatory capital held to support the assets: and Some products, especially in the US, have guarantee features linked to equity indices.
A mismatch between guaranteed product liabilities and the performance of the underlying assets exposes the Group to equity index risk.
In order to mitigate this risk, the relevant business units purchase swaptions, equity options and futures to better match asset performance with liabilities under equity-indexed products.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 215 C:  C3:  C3.5  Hedging The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of the following hedges under IAS 39.
Netinvestmenthedges At 31 December 2015, the Group has designated perpetual subordinated capital securities totalling US$2.8 billion 2014: US$2.8 billion as a net investment hedge to hedge the currency risks related to the net investment in Jackson.
The carrying value of the subordinated capital securities was 1,895 million as at 31 December 2015 2014: 1,789 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 104 million 2014: loss of 96 million on translation of the borrowings to pounds sterling at the statement of financial position date is recognised in the translation reserve in shareholders equity.
This net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective.
The Group has no cash flow hedges or fair value hedges in place.
c Derecognition,  Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Group has entered into securities lending including repurchase agreements whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms.
The amounts above the fair value of the loaned securities required to be received as collateral by the agreements depend on the quality of the collateral, calculated on a daily basis.
The loaned securities are not removed from the Groups consolidated statement of financial position, rather they are retained within the appropriate investment classification.
Collateral typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities and letters of credit.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had lent 5,995 million 2014: 4,578 million of securities of which 4,687 million 2014: 3,129 million was lent by the PAC with-profits fund and held cash and securities collateral under such agreements of 6,342 million 2014: 4,887 million of which 5,002 million 2014: 3,400 million was held by the PAC with-profits fund.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of these transactions was 10,076 million 2014: 12,857 million.
In addition, at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into repurchase transactions for which the fair value of the collateral pledged was 190 million in the form of securities and 10 million in the form of cash 2014: 186 million in the form of securities.
Collateral and pledges under derivative transactions At 31 December 2015, the Group had pledged 1,622 million 2014: 1,411 million for liabilities and held collateral of 1,865 million 2014: 2,388 million in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements.
Offsetting assets and liabilities The Groups derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements.
A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and due from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy.
The Group recognises amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis within the consolidated balance sheets.
The following tables present the gross and net information about the Groups financial instruments subject to master netting arrangements: 31Dec2015 m Grossamount presentedinthe  consolidated  statementof financial Financial Cash Securities position instruments collateral collateral Netamount note i note ii note iii Financial assets: Derivative assets 2,835 1,071 1,122 591 51 Reverse repurchase agreements 8,591 8,591 Total financial assets 11,426 1,071 1,122 9,182 51 Financial liabilities: Derivative liabilities 2,879 1,071 764 809 235 Securities lending 1,779 189 1,590 Repurchase agreements 200 10 190 Total financial liabilities 4,858 1,071 963 2,589 235 216 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.

In the tables above, the amounts of assets or liabilities presented in the consolidated statement of financial position are offset first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements with any remaining amount reduced by the amount of cash and securities collateral.
The actual amount of collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables.
d  In accordance with the Groups accounting policy set out in note A3.1j iii, impairment reviews were performed for available-for-sale securities and loans and receivables.
In addition, impairment reviews were undertaken for the reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, net impairment charges of 35 million 2014: net impairment reversals of 37 million were recognised for available-for-sale securities and loans and receivables analysed as follows: 2015 m 2014 m Available-for-sale debt securities held by Jackson 19 7 Loans and receivables 16 44 Net charge credit for impairment net of reversals 35 37 Theimpairment charges .
Impairment recognised on available-for-sale securities amounted to 19 million 2014: 7 million arising from: 2015 m 2014 m Residential mortgage-backed securities 8 2 Public fixed income 2 Other 9 5 19 7 www.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 217 C:  C3:  C3.5  The impairment recorded on the residential mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to reduced cash flow expectations on such securities that are collateralised by diversified pools of primarily below investment grade securities.
Of the impaired losses of 19 million 2014: 7 million, the top five individual corporate issuers made up 74 per cent 2014: 76 per cent, reflecting a deteriorating business outlook of the companies concerned.
The impairment losses have been recorded in investment return in the income statement.
Jacksons portfolio of debt securities is managed proactively with credit analysts closely monitoring and reporting on the credit quality of its holdings.
Jackson continues to review its investments on a case-by-case basis to determine whether any decline in fair value represents an impairment.
In addition, investments in structured securities are subject to a rigorous review of their future estimated cash flows, including expected and stress case scenarios, to identify potential shortfalls in contractual payments both interest and principal.
Impairment charges are recorded on structured securities when the Company forecasts a contractual payment shortfall.
Situations where such a shortfall would not lead to a recognition of a loss are rare.
However, some structured securities do not have a single determined set of future cash flows and instead, there can be a reasonable range of estimates that could potentially emerge.
With this variability, there could be instances where the projected cash flow shortfall under managements base case set of assumptions is so minor that relatively small and justifiable changes to the base case assumptions would eliminate the need for an impairment loss to be recognised.
The impairment loss reflects the difference between the fair value and book value.
In 2015, the Group realised gross losses on sales of available-for-sale securities of 85 million 2014: 35 million with 57 per cent 2014: 68 per cent of these losses related to the disposal of fixed maturity securities of the top 10 individual issuers, which were disposed of as part of risk reduction programmes intended to limit future credit loss exposure.
Of the 85 million 2014: 35 million, 54 million 2014: 5 million relates to losses on sales of impaired and deteriorating securities.
The effect of those reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions that underpin the assessment of whether impairment has taken place depends on the factors described in note A3.1j iii.
A key indicator of whether such impairment may arise in future, and the potential amounts at risk, is the profile of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities accounted for on an available-for-sale basis by reference to the time periods by which the securities have been held continuously in an unrealised loss position and by reference to the maturity date of the securities concerned.
For 2015, the amount of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale under IFRS in an unrealised loss position was 673 million 2014: 180 million.
Notes B1.2 and C3.3 provide further details on the impairment charges and unrealised losses of Jacksons available-for-sale securities.

Although the ceding of insurance does not relieve the Group from its liability to its policyholders, the Group participates in such agreements for the purpose of managing its loss exposure.
The Group evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimise its exposure from reinsurer insolvencies.
Of the reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities balance of 7,903 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 7,167 million, 90 per cent 2014: 93 per cent were ceded by the Groups UK and US operations, of which 96 per cent 2014: 95 per cent of the balances were from reinsurers with Standard & Poors rating Aand above.
The reinsurance asset for Jackson as shown in the table above primarily relates to certain fully collateralised former REALIC business retained by Swiss Re through 100 per cent reinsurance agreements.
Apart from the reinsurance of REALIC business, the principal reinsurance ceded by Jackson outside the Group is on term life insurance, direct and assumed accident and health business and GMIB variable annuity guarantees.
Net commissions received on ceded business and claims incurred ceded to external reinsurers totalled 41 million and 442 million respectively during 2015 2014: 35 million and 398 million respectively.
There were no deferred gains or losses on reinsurance contracts in either 2015 or 2014.
In each of 2015 and 2014, the Groups UK insurance business entered into longevity reinsurance transactions on certain aspects of the UKs annuity liabilities.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 225 C:  C4:  C4.1  ii  With the exception of most unitised with-profits bonds and other whole-of-life contracts, the majority of the contracts of the UK insurance operations have a contract term.
In effect, the maturity term of the other contracts reflects the earlier of death, maturity or the policy lapsing.
In addition, as described in note A3.1, with-profits contract liabilities include projected future bonuses based on current investment values.
The actual amounts payable will vary with future investment performance of SAIF and the WPSF.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information C4.2  a Asia  The life insurance products offered by the Groups Asia operations include a range of with-profits and non-participating term, whole life, endowment and unit-linked policies.
The Asia operations also offer health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage to supplement its core life products.
The terms and conditions of the contracts written by the Asia operations and, in particular, the products options and guarantees, vary from territory to territory depending upon local market circumstances.
In general terms, the Asia participating products provide savings and protection where the basic sum assured can be enhanced by a profit share or bonus from the underlying fund as determined at the discretion of the insurers.
The Asia operations non-participating term, whole life and endowment products offer savings and or protection where the benefits are guaranteed, or determined by a set of defined market-related parameters.
Unit-linked products combine savings with protection, the cash value of the policy depends on the value of the underlying unitised funds.
Health and Protection policies provide mortality or morbidity benefits and include health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage.
Health and Protection products are commonly offered as supplements to main life policies but can be sold separately.
Product guarantees in Asia can be broadly classified into four main categories, namely premium rate, cash value or interest rate guarantees, policy renewability and convertibility options.
Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described in note C4.2 c in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts written in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
Participating products have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements.
Non-participating long-term products are the only ones where the Group is contractually obliged to provide guarantees on all benefits.
Unit-linked products have the lowest level of guarantee.
The risks on death coverage through premium rate guarantees are low due to the diversified nature of the business as well as rigorous product pricing.
Cash value and interest rate guarantees are of three types: Maturityvalues Maturity values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
Declared regular bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Future bonus rates and cash dividends are not guaranteed on participating products: Surrendervalues Surrender values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
The surrender value of declared reversionary bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Market value adjustments and surrender penalties are used for certain products and where the law permits such adjustments in cash values: and  It is common in Asia for regulations or market-driven demand and competition to provide some form of capital value protection and minimum crediting interest rate guarantees.
This would be reflected within the guaranteed maturity and surrender values.
The guarantees are borne by shareholders for non-participating and investment-linked non-investment guarantees only products.
Participating product guarantees are predominantly supported by the segregated life funds and their estates.
Whole-of-life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions are written in the Korea life operations though this is not to a significant extent as Korea has a much higher proportion of linked and health business.
The Korea business has non-linked liabilities and linked liabilities at 31 December 2015 of 625 million and 2,187 million respectively 2014: 596 million and 2,109 million respectively.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 227 C:  C4:  C4.2   For the with-profits business, the total value of the with-profits funds is driven by the underlying asset valuation with movements reflected principally in the accounting value of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
Similarly, for the unit-linked business, the attaching liabilities reflect the unit value obligation driven by the value of the investments of the unit fund.
For the shareholder-backed non-linked business, the future policyholder benefit provisions for Asia businesses in the Groups IFRS accounts, are determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with the modified statutory basis or where local GAAP is not well established and in which the business written is primarily non-participating and linked business, US GAAP principles are used as the most appropriate reporting basis.
For the countries which apply local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with modified statutory basis, the approach to determining the contract liabilities is driven by the local solvency basis.
A gross premium valuation method is used in those countries where a risk-based capital framework is adopted for local solvency.
Under the gross premium valuation method, all cash flows are valued explicitly using best estimate assumptions.
A risk-based capital framework applying the gross premium valuation method is adopted by Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
In applying this approach, an overlay constraint to the method is applied such that no negative reserves are derived at an individual policyholder level.
In Vietnam, the Company uses an estimation basis aligned substantially to that used by the countries applying the gross premium valuation method.
In the Philippines, the local regulator requires insurers to adopt the gross premium valuation method for traditional business from 30 June 2016 onwards.
The Company decided to early adopt this requirement for IFRS reporting for the 2015 year end.
For India, Taiwan and, until its sale in 2015, Japan, US GAAP is applied for measuring insurance assets and liabilities.
For these countries, the future policyholder benefit provisions for non-linked business are determined using the net level premium method, with an allowance for surrenders, maintenance and claims expenses.
The other Asia operations principally adopt a net premium valuation method to determine the future policyholder benefit provisions.
The effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities for Asia insurance operations is as disclosed in note B4 a. b US  Jackson provides long-term savings and retirement products to retail and institutional customers throughout the US and offers the products discussed below: i Fixed annuities Fixed interest rate annuities At 31 December 2015, fixed interest rate annuities accounted for 9 per cent 2014: 9 per cent of policy and contract liabilities of Jackson.
Fixed interest rate annuities are primarily deferred annuity products that are used for asset accumulation in retirement planning and for providing income in retirement.
They permit tax-deferred accumulation of funds and flexible payout options.
The policyholder of a fixed interest rate annuity pays Jackson a premium, which is credited to the policyholders account.
Periodically, interest is credited to the policyholders account and in some cases administrative charges are deducted from the policyholders account.
Jackson makes benefit payments at a future date as specified in the policy based on the value of the policyholders account at that date.
The policy provides that at Jacksons discretion it may reset the interest rate, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
At 31 December 2015, Jackson had fixed interest rate annuities totalling 12.1 billion 2014: 11.7 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and a 3.00 per cent average guaranteed rate 2014: 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and a 3.03 per cent average guaranteed rate.
Approximately 62 per cent 2014: 57 per cent of the fixed interest rate annuities Jackson wrote in 2015 provide for a market value adjustment MVA, that could be positive or negative, on surrenders in the surrender period of the policy.
This formula-based adjustment approximates the change in value that assets supporting the product would realise as interest rates move up or down.
The minimum guaranteed rate is not affected by this adjustment.
While the MVA feature minimises the surrender risk associated with certain fixed annuities, Jackson still bears a portion of the surrender risk on policies without this feature, and the investment risk on all fixed interest rate annuities.
228 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Fixed index annuities Fixed index annuities accounted for 6 per cent 2014: 6 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December 2015.
Fixed index annuities vary in structure, but generally are deferred annuities that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return based on participation rates and caps, and provide a guaranteed minimum return.
These guaranteed minimum rates are generally set at 1.0 to 3.0 per cent.
At 31 December 2015, Jackson had fixed index annuities allocated to indexed funds totalling 6.4 billion 2014: 6.3 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates on index accounts ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.79 per cent average guaranteed rate 2014: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.83 per cent average guarantee rate.
At 31 December 2015, Jackson also offered fixed interest accounts on some fixed index annuity products.
At 31 December 2015, fixed interest accounts of fixed index annuities totalled 1.9 billion 2014: 1.8 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 2.52 per cent average guaranteed rate 2014: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 2.53 per cent average guaranteed rate.
Jackson hedges the equity return risk on fixed index products using offsetting equity exposure in the variable annuity product.
The cost of hedging is taken into account in setting the index participation rates or caps.
Jackson bears the investment risk and a portion of the surrender risk on these products.
Immediate annuities At 31 December 2015, immediate annuities accounted for 1 per cent 2014: 1 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
Immediate annuities guarantee a series of payments beginning within a year of purchase and continuing over either a fixed period of years and or the life of the policyholder.
If the term is for the life of the policyholder, then Jacksons primary risks are mortality and reinvestment.
The implicit interest rate on these products is based on the market conditions that exist at the time the policy is issued and is guaranteed for the term of the annuity.
ii Variable annuities At 31 December 2015, variable annuities accounted for 70 per cent 2014: 69 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
Variable annuities are deferred annuities that have the same tax advantages and payout options as fixed interest rate and fixed index annuities.
They are also used for asset accumulation in retirement planning and to provide income in retirement.
The primary differences between variable annuities and fixed interest rate or fixed index annuities are investment risk and return.
If a policyholder chooses a variable annuity, the rate of return depends upon the performance of the selected fund portfolio.
Policyholders may allocate their investment to either the fixed account or a selection of variable accounts.
Investment risk on the variable account is borne by the policyholder, while investment risk on the fixed account is borne by Jackson through guaranteed minimum fixed rates of return.
At 31 December 2015, 6 per cent 2014: 5 per cent of variable annuity funds were in fixed accounts.
Jackson had variable annuity funds in fixed accounts totalling 5.5 billion 2014: 4.4 billion with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.70 per cent average guaranteed rate 2014: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.81 per cent average guaranteed rate.
Jackson issues variable annuity contracts where it contractually guarantees to the policyholder a return of no less than either, a total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals, b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return, or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death guaranteed minimum death benefit GMDB, at annuitisation guaranteed minimum income benefit GMIB, upon the depletion of funds guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit GMWB or at the end of a specified period guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit GMAB.
Jackson hedges these risks using equity options and futures contracts as described in note C7.3.
The GMAB and GMIB are no longer offered, with the existing GMIB coverage being substantially reinsured.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 229 C:  C4:  C4.2  iii Life insurance Life insurance products accounted for 11 per cent 2014: 12 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December 2015.
Jackson discontinued new sales of life insurance products in 2012.
Life products include term life and interest-sensitive life universal life and variable universal life.
Term life provides protection for a defined period and a benefit that is payable to a designated beneficiary upon death of the insured.
Universal life provides permanent individual life insurance for the life of the insured and includes a savings element.
Variable universal life is a type of life insurance policy that combines death benefit protection with the ability for the policyholder account to be invested in separate account funds.
For certain fixed universal life plans, additional provisions are held to reflect the existence of guarantees offered in the past that are no longer supported by earnings on the existing asset portfolio, or for situations where future mortality charges are not expected to be sufficient to provide for future mortality costs.
Excluding the business that is subject to the retrocession treaties at 31 December 2015, Jackson had interest-sensitive life business in force with total account value of 6.1 billion 2014: 5.9 billion, with minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent with a 4.66 per cent average guaranteed rate 2014: 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent with a 4.65 per cent average guaranteed rate.
iv Institutional products Jacksons institutional products consist of traditional guaranteed investment contracts GICs, funding agreements including agreements issued in conjunction with Jacksons participation in the US Federal Home Loan Bank programme and Medium Term Note funding agreements.
At 31 December 2015, institutional products accounted for 3 per cent of policy and contract liabilities 2014: 3 per cent.
Under a traditional GIC, the policyholder makes a lump sum deposit.
The interest rate paid is fixed and established when the contract is issued.
If deposited funds are withdrawn earlier than the specified term of the contract, an adjustment is made that approximates a market value adjustment.
Under a funding agreement, the policyholder either makes a lump sum deposit or makes specified periodic deposits.
Jackson agrees to pay a rate of interest, which may be fixed or a floating short-term interest rate linked to an external index.
The duration of the funding agreements range between one and thirty years.
In 2015 and 2014, there were no funding agreements terminable by the policyholder with less than 90 days notice.
v Aggregate account values The table below shows the distribution of account values for fixed annuities fixed interest rate and fixed index, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, and interest sensitive life business within the range of minimum guaranteed interest rates as described in notes i to iii above as at 31 December 2015 and 2014:   annuities  m m  2015 2014 2015 2014 1.00% 5,563 3,927 1.0% 2.0% 7,670 7,887 2.0% 3.0% 9,586 9,365 204 195 3.0% 4.0% 1,263 1,239 2,322 2,265 4.0% 5.0% 1,639 1,567 2,023 1,971 5.0% 6.0% 212 207 1,574 1,514 Total 25,933 24,192 6,123 5,945  As permissible under IFRS 4 and consistent with the basis explained in note A3.1, in the case of Jackson the carrying values of insurance assets and liabilities are consolidated into the Group accounts based on US GAAP.
An overview of the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs for Jackson is provided in note C5.1 b.
With minor exceptions, all of Jacksons contracts are accounted for as investment contracts as defined for US GAAP purposes by applying in the first instance a retrospective deposit method to determine the liability for policyholder benefits.
This is then augmented by potentially three additional amounts, namely: Any amounts that have been assessed to compensate the insurer for services to be performed over future periods ie deferred income : Any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract: and Any probable future loss on the contract ie premium deficiency.

Estimated gross profits include estimates of the following, each of which will be determined based on the best estimate of amounts over the life of the book of contracts without provision for adverse deviation: Amounts expected to be assessed for mortality less benefit claims in excess of related policyholder balances: Amounts expected to be assessed for contract administration less costs incurred for contract administration: Amounts expected to be earned from the investment of policyholder balances less interest credited to policyholder balances: Amounts expected to be assessed against policyholder balances upon termination of contracts sometimes referred to as surrender charges : and Other expected assessments and credits.
In the case of variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits as described above, liabilities for these benefits are accounted for under US GAAP and are valued as described below.
In accordance with US GAAP, the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and the for life portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit liabilities are determined each period end by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognising the excess ratably over the life of the contract based on total expected assessments.
At 31 December 2015, these liabilities were valued using a series of stochastic investment performance scenarios, a mean investment return of 7.4 per cent 2014: 7.4 per cent net of external fund management fees, and assumptions for lapse, mortality and expense that are similar to those used in amortising the capitalised acquisition costs.
The direct Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability is determined by estimating the expected value of the annuitisation benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the date of annuitisation and recognising the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments.
The assumptions used for calculating the direct Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability at 31 December 2015 and 2014 are consistent with those used for calculating the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and for life Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit liabilities.
Jackson regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit for life liability balances, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits are essentially fully reinsured, subject to a modest deductible and annual claim limits.
As this reinsurance benefit is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39, and is therefore recognised at fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of short-term fluctuations.
The direct GMIB liability is not considered a derivative instrument under IAS 39 and, as such, an accounting difference arises from this one-sided mark to market.
Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit not for life features are considered to be embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Therefore, provisions for these benefits are recognised at fair value.
The change in these guaranteed benefit reserves, along with claim payments and associated fees included in reserves, are included along with the hedge results in short-term fluctuations, resulting in removal of the market impact from the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
For Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit reinsurance embedded derivatives that are fair valued under IAS 39, Jackson bases its volatility assumptions on implied market volatility for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years, where sufficient market liquidity is assumed to exist, followed by grading to long-term historical volatility levels beyond that point, where such long-term historical volatility levels contain an explicit margin for conservatism.
Non-performance risk is incorporated into the calculation through the use of discount interest rates sourced from an AA corporate credit curve as a proxy for Jacksons own credit risk.
Other risk margins, particularly for policyholder behaviour and long-term volatility, are also incorporated into the model through the use of explicitly conservative assumptions.
On a periodic basis, Jackson validates the resulting fair values based on comparisons to other models and market movements.
With the exception of the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit features of variable annuity contracts, the financial guarantee features of Jacksons contracts are in most circumstances not explicitly valued, but the impact of any interest guarantees would be reflected as they are earned in the current account value ie the US GAAP liability.
For traditional life insurance contracts, provisions for future policy benefits are determined under US GAAP using the net level premium method and assumptions as of the issue date as to mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses plus provisions for adverse deviation.
Institutional products are accounted for as investment contracts under IFRS with the liability classified as being in respect of financial instruments rather than insurance contracts, as defined by IFRS 4.
In practice there is no material difference between the IFRS and US GAAP basis of recognition and measurement for these contracts.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 231 C:  C4:  C4.2  Certain institutional products representing obligations issued in currencies other than US dollars have been hedged for changes in exchange rates using cross-currency swaps.
The fair value of derivatives embedded in funding agreements, as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, are included in the carrying value of the trust instruments supported by funding agreements recorded in other non-insurance liabilities.
c UK  Prudentials long-term products in the UK consist of life insurance, pension products and pension annuities.
These products are written primarily in: One of three separate sub-funds of the PAC long-term fund, namely the with-profits sub-fund WPSF, Scottish Amicable Insurance Funds SAIF, and the non-profit sub-fund: Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL, a shareholder-owned subsidiary: or Other shareholder-backed subsidiaries writing mainly non-profit unit-linked business.
i With-profits products and PAC with-profits sub-fund The WPSF mainly contains with-profits business but it also contains some non-profit business unit-linked, term assurances and annuities.
The WPSFs profits are apportioned 90 per cent to its policyholders and 10 per cent to shareholders as surplus for distribution is determined via the annual actuarial valuation.
The WPSF held a provision of 47 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 50 million to honour guarantees on a small amount of guaranteed annuity products.
SAIFs exposure to guaranteed annuities is described below.
With-profits products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed.
There are two types of bonuses: regular and final.
Regular bonuses are declared once a year, and once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike regular bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
The main factors that influence the determination of bonus rates are the return on the investments of the with-profits fund, inflation, taxation, the expenses of the fund chargeable to policyholders and the degree to which investment returns are smoothed.
The overall rate of return earned on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences on bonus rates.
A high proportion of the assets backing the with-profits business are invested in equities and real estate.
If the financial strength of the with-profits business is affected, then a higher proportion of fixed interest or similar assets might be held by the fund.
Further details on the determination of the two types of the bonuses: regular and final are provided below.
Regular bonus rates For regular bonuses, the bonus rates are determined for each type of policy primarily by targeting the bonus level at a prudent proportion of the long-term expected future investment return on underlying assets.
The expected future investment return is reduced as appropriate for each type of policy to allow for items such as expenses, charges, tax and shareholders transfers.
However, the rates declared may differ by product type, or by the date of payment of the premium, or date of issue of the policy, or if the accumulated regular bonuses are particularly high or low, relative to a prudent proportion of the achieved investment return.
When target bonus levels change the PAC Board of Directors has regard to the overall strength of the long-term fund when determining the length of time over which it will seek to achieve the amended prudent target bonus level.
In normal investment conditions, PAC expects changes in regular bonus rates to be gradual over time.
However, PAC retains the discretion whether or not to declare a regular bonus each year, and there is no limit on the amount by which regular bonus rates can change.
Final bonus rates A final bonus which is normally declared yearly, may be added when a claim is paid or when units of a unitised product are realised.
The rates of final bonus usually vary by type of policy and by reference to the period, usually a year, in which the policy commences or each premium is paid.
These rates are determined by reference to the asset shares for the sample policies but subject to the smoothing approach as explained below.
In general, the same final bonus scale applies to maturity, death and surrender claims except that: The total surrender value may be impacted by the application of a Market Value Reduction for accumulating with-profits policies and by the surrender bases for conventional with-profits business: and For the SAIF and Scottish Amicable, the final bonus rates applicable on surrender may be adjusted to reflect expected future bonus rates.
Application of significant judgement The application of the above method for determining bonuses requires the PAC Board to apply significant judgement in many respects, including in particular the following: Determining what constitutes fair treatment of customers: Prudential is required by UK law and regulation to consider the fair treatment of its customers in setting bonus levels.
The concept of determining what constitutes fair treatment, while established by statute, is not defined: Smoothing of investment returns: This is an important feature of with-profits products.
Determining when particular circumstances, such as a significant rise or fall in market values, warrant variations in the standard bonus smoothing limits that apply in normal circumstances requires the PAC Board of Directors to exercise significant judgement: and Determining at what level to set bonuses to ensure that they are competitive: The overall return to policyholders is an important competitive measure for attracting new business.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Key assumptions As noted above, the overall rate of return on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences in bonus rates, subject to the smoothing described below.
Prudential determines the assumptions to apply in respect of these factors, including the effects of reasonably likely changes in key assumptions, in the context of the overarching discretionary and smoothing framework that applies to its with-profits business as described above.
As such, it is not possible to specifically quantify the effects of each of these assumptions, or of reasonably likely changes in these assumptions.
Prudentials approach, in applying significant judgement and discretion in relation to determining bonus rates, is consistent conceptually with the approach adopted by other firms that manage a with-profits business and is also consistent with the requirements of the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM that are applied in the management of their with-profits funds.
The principles contain an explanation of how it determines regular and final bonus rates within the discretionary framework that applies to all with-profits policies, subject to the general legislative requirements applicable.
Its purpose is therefore to: Explain the nature and extent of the discretion available: Show how competing or conflicting interests or expectations of different groups and generations of policyholders, and policyholders and shareholders are managed so that all policyholders and shareholders are treated fairly: and Provide a knowledgeable observer eg a financial adviser with an understanding of the material risks and rewards from starting and continuing to invest in a with-profits policy with Prudential.
Furthermore, in accordance with industry-wide regulatory requirements, the PAC Board has appointed: A Chief Actuary who provides the PAC Board with all actuarial advice: A With-Profits Actuary whose specific duty is to advise the PAC Board on the reasonableness and proportionality of the manner in which its discretion has been exercised in applying the Principles and Practices of Financial Management and the manner in which any conflicting interests have been addressed: and A With-Profits Committee of independent individuals, which assesses the degree of compliance with the Principles and Practices of Financial Management and the manner in which conflicting rights have been addressed.
Smoothing of investment return In determining bonus rates for the UK with-profits policies, smoothing is applied to the allocation of the overall earnings of the UK with-profits fund of which the investment return is a significant element.
The smoothing approach differs between accumulating and conventional with-profits policies to reflect the different contract features.
In normal circumstances, Prudential does not expect most payout values on policies of the same duration to change by more than 10 per cent up or down from one year to the next, although some larger changes may occur to balance payout values between different policies.
Greater flexibility may be required in certain circumstances, for example following a significant rise or fall in market values, and in such situations the PAC Board may decide to vary the standard bonus smoothing limits in order to protect the overall interests of policyholders.
The degree of smoothing is illustrated numerically by comparing in the following table the relatively smoothed level of policyholder bonuses declared as part of the surplus for distribution, with the more volatile movement in investment return and other items of income and expenditure of the UK component of the PAC with-profits fund for each year presented.
2015 m 2014 m Net income of the fund: Investment return 3,130 8,958 Claims incurred 6,745 6,115 Movement in policyholder liabilities 1,307 4,366 Add back policyholder bonuses for the year as shown below 1,943 1,812 Claims incurred and movement in policyholder liabilities including charge for provision for asset shares and excluding policyholder bonuses 6,109 8,669 Earned premiums, net of reinsurance 6,507 3,007 Other income 210 72 Acquisition costs and other expenditure 1,318 961 Share of profits from investment joint ventures 53 129 Tax charge 148 440 Net income of the fund before movement in unallocated surplus 2,325 2,096 Movement in unallocated surplus 168 84 Surplus for distribution 2,157 2,012 Surplus for distribution allocated as follows: 90% policyholders bonus as shown above 1,943 1,812 10% shareholders transfers 214 200 2,157 2,012 www.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 233 C:  C4:  C4.2  ii Annuity business Prudentials conventional annuities include level, fixed-increase and inflation-linked annuities, the link being to the Retail Price Index RPI in the majority of cases.
Prudentials fixed-increase annuities incorporate automatic increases in annuity payments by fixed amounts over the policyholders life.
The RPI annuities that Prudential offers provide for a regular annuity payment to which an additional amount is added periodically based on the increase in the UK RPI.
Prudentials with-profits annuities, which are written in the WPSF, combine the income features of annuity products with the investment smoothing features of with-profits products and enable policyholders to obtain exposure to investment return on the WPSFs equity shares, property and other investment categories over time.
Policyholders select a required smoothed return bonus from the specific range Prudential offers for the particular product.
The amount of the annuity payment each year depends upon the relationship between the required smoothed return bonus rate selected by the policyholder when the product is purchased and the smoothed return bonus rates Prudential subsequently declares each year during the term of the product.
If the total bonus rates fall below the anticipated rate, then the annuity income falls.
iii SAIF SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC long-term fund formed following the acquisition of the mutually owned Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society in 1997.
No new business may be written in SAIF, although regular premiums are still being paid on policies in force at the time of the acquisition and incremental premiums are permitted on these policies.
The fund is solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of this fund although they are entitled to asset management fees on this business.
The process for determining policyholder bonuses of SAIF with-profits policies, which constitute the vast majority of obligations of the funds, is similar to that for the with-profits policies of the WPSF.
However, in addition, the surplus assets in SAIF are allocated to policies in an orderly and equitable distribution over time as enhancements to policyholder benefits ie in excess of those based on asset share.
Provision is made for the risks attaching to some SAIF unitised with-profits policies that have Market Value Reduction MVR-free dates and for those SAIF products which have a guaranteed minimum benefit on death or maturity of premiums accumulated at 4 per cent per annum.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuities in the UK is through SAIF and a provision of 412 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2015 2014: 549 million to honour the guarantees.
As SAIF is a separate sub-fund solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF, this provision has no impact on the financial position of the Groups shareholders equity.
iv Unit-linked non-annuity and other non-profit business Prudential UK insurance operations also have an extensive book of unit-linked policies of varying types and provide a range of other non-profit business such as credit life and protection contracts.
These contracts do not contain significant financial guarantees.
There are no guaranteed maturity values or guaranteed annuity options on unit-linked policies except for minor amounts for certain policies linked to cash units within SAIF.
 i Overview The calculation of the contract liabilities involves the setting of assumptions for future experience.
This is done following detailed review of the relevant experience including in particular mortality, expenses, tax, economic assumptions and, where applicable, persistency.
For with-profits business written in the WPSF or SAIF, a market consistent valuation is performed as described in section ii below.
Additional assumptions required are for persistency and the management actions under which the fund is managed.
Assumptions used for a market-consistent valuation typically do not contain margins, whereas those used for the valuation of other classes of business do.
Mortality assumptions are set based on the results of the most recent experience analysis looking at the experience over recent years of the relevant business.
For non-profit business, a margin for adverse deviation is added.
Different assumptions are applied for different product groups.
For annuitant mortality, assumptions for current mortality rates are based on recent experience investigations and expected future improvements in mortality.
The expected future improvements are based on recent experience and projections of the business and industry experience generally.
Maintenance and, for some classes of business, termination expense assumptions are expressed as per policy amounts.
They are set based on the expenses incurred during the year, including an allowance for ongoing investment expenditure and allocated between entities and product groups in accordance with the operations internal cost allocation model.
For non-profit business a margin for adverse deviation is added to this amount.
Expense inflation assumptions are set consistent with the economic basis and based on the difference between yields on nominal gilts and index-linked gilts.
The actual renewal expenses incurred on behalf of SAIF by other Group companies are recharged in full to SAIF.
The assumptions for asset management expenses are based on the charges specified in agreements with the Groups asset management operations, plus a margin for adverse deviation for non-profit business.
Tax assumptions are set equal to current rates of taxation.
For non-profit business excluding unit-linked business, the valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are based on the yields as at the valuation date on the assets backing the technical provisions.
For fixed interest securities the gross redemption yield is used except for the non-profit annuities within PAC and PRIL annuity business where the internal rate of return of the assets backing the liabilities is used.
Properties are valued using the lower of the rental yield and the redemption yield, and for equities it is the greater of the dividend yield and the average of the dividend yield and the earnings yield.
An adjustment is made to the yield on non-risk-free fixed interest securities and property to reflect credit risk.
To calculate the non-unit reserves for linked business, assumptions have been set for the gross unit growth rate and the rate of inflation of maintenance expenses, as well as for the valuation interest rate as described above.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information ii WPSF and SAIF The policyholder liabilities reported for the WPSF are primarily for two broad types of business.
These are accumulating and conventional with-profits contracts.
The policyholder liabilities of the WPSF are accounted for under FRS 27.
The provisions have been determined on a basis consistent with the detailed methodology included in regulations contained in the PRAs rules for the determination of reserves on the PRAs realistic Peak 2 basis.
In aggregate, the regime has the effect of placing a value on the liabilities of UK with-profits contracts, which reflects the amounts expected to be paid based on the current value of investments held by the with-profits funds and current circumstances.
These contracts are a combination of insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features, as defined by IFRS 4.
The PRAs Peak 2 calculation under the realistic regime requirement is explained further in note A3.1 d under the UK regulated with-profits section.
The contract liabilities for with-profits business also require assumptions for persistency.
These are set based on the results of recent experience analysis.
The process of determining policyholder liabilities of SAIF is similar to that for the with-profits policies of the WPSF.
iii Annuity business Credit risk provisions For IFRS reporting, the results for UK shareholder-backed annuity business are particularly sensitive to the allowances made for credit risk.
Further details on credit risk allowance are provided in note B4 c. Mortality The mortality assumptions are set in light of recent population and internal experience.
The assumptions used are percentages of standard actuarial mortality tables with an allowance for future mortality improvements.
Where annuities have been sold on an enhanced basis to impaired lives an additional age adjustment is made.
The percentages of the standard table used are selected according to the source of business.
New mortality projection models are released annually by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI.
The CMI 2014 model was used to produce the 2015 results and the CMI 2012 model was used to produce the 2014 results: both calibrated to reflect an appropriate view of future mortality improvements.
For annuities in payment, the tables and range of percentages used are set out below: Non-profitannuities withintheWPSF PRIL CMIModel,   Males Females Males Females 2015 CMI 2014 For males: with a long-term 95% 97% 91% 103% 93% 83% 96% improvement rate of 2.25% pa PCMA00 PCFA00 PCMA00 PCFA00 For females: with a long-term improvement rate of 1.50% pa 2014 CMI 2012 For males: with a long-term 93% 99% 89% 101% 91% 95% 84% 98% improvement rate of 2.25% pa PCMA00 PCFA00 PCMA00 PCFA00 For females: with a long-term improvement rate of 1.50% pa For annuities in deferment, the tables used by both the non-profit annuities within the WPSF and PRIL were AM92 4 years Males and AF92 4 years Females for 2015 and 2014. iv Unit-linked non-annuity and other non-profit business The majority of other long-term business written in the UK insurance operations is unit-linked business or other business with similar features.
For these contracts the attaching liability reflects the unit value obligation and provision for expenses and mortality risk.
The latter component is determined by applying mortality assumptions on a basis that is appropriate for the policyholder profile.
For unit-linked business, the assets covering unit liabilities are exposed to market risk, but the residual risk when considering the unit-linked liabilities and assets together is limited to the effect on fund-based charges.
For those contracts where the level of insurance risk is insignificant, the assets and liabilities arising under the contracts are distinguished between those that relate to the financial instrument liability and acquisition costs and deferred income that relate to the component of the contract that relates to investment management.
Acquisition costs and deferred income are recognised consistent with the level of service provision in line with the requirements of IAS 18. v Effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities Credit risk There has been no change of approach in the setting of assumption levels of credit risk in 2015 and 2014.
However, changes in the portfolio have given rise to altered levels of credit risk allowance as set out in note B4 b.
Other assumption changes The effect of other assumption changes for the shareholder-backed business is set out in note B4 b.
For the with-profits sub-fund, the aggregate effect of assumption changes in 2015 was a net charge to unallocated surplus of 114 million 2014: net charge of 86 million.

These goodwill amounts are not individually material.
The aggregate goodwill impairment of 120 million at 31 December 2014 related to the goodwill held by the Japan life business, prior to its sale in February 2015.
Impairmenttesting Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
These cash-generating units are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
 Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the cash-generating units carrying amount, including any goodwill, with its recoverable amount.
With the exception of M&G, the goodwill attributable to shareholders mainly relates to acquired life businesses.
The Company routinely compares the aggregate of net asset value and acquired goodwill on an IFRS basis of acquired life business with the value of the business as determined using the EEV methodology, as described in note 13.
Any excess of IFRS over EEV carrying value is then compared with EEV basis value of current and projected future new business to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill in the IFRS statement of financial position may be impaired.
The assumptions underpinning the Groups EEV basis of reporting are included in the EEV basis supplementary information in this Annual Report.
M&G The recoverable amount for the M&G cash-generating units has been determined by calculating its value in use.
This has been calculated by aggregating the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the M&G operating segment based upon management projections.
The discounted cash flow valuation has been based on a three-year plan prepared by M&G, and approved by management, and cash flow projections for later years.
The value in use is particularly sensitive to a number of key assumptions as follows: i The set of economic, market and business assumptions used to derive the three-year plan.
The direct and secondary effects of recent developments, eg changes in global equity markets, are considered by management in arriving at the expectations for the financial projections for the plan: ii The assumed growth rate on forecast cash flows beyond the terminal year of the plan.
A growth rate of 2.5 per cent 2014: 2.5 per cent has been used to extrapolate beyond the plan period representing managements best estimate view of the long-term growth rate of the business after considering the future and past growth rates and external sources of data: iii The risk discount rate.
Differing discount rates have been applied in accordance with the nature of the individual component businesses.
For retail and institutional business, a risk discount rate of 12 per cent 2014: 12 per cent has been applied to post-tax cash flows.
The pre-tax risk discount rate was 16 per cent 2014: 16 per cent.
Management have determined the risk discount rate by reference to an average implied discount rate for comparable UK listed asset managers calculated by reference to risk-free rates, equity risk premiums of 5 per cent and an average beta factor for relative market risk of comparable UK listed asset managers.
A similar approach has been applied for the other component businesses of M&G: and iv That asset management contracts continue on similar terms.
Management believes that any reasonable change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of M&G to fall below its carrying amount.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 237 C:  C5:  C5.1   Under IFRS 4, the Group applies grandfathered US GAAP for measuring the insurance assets and liabilities of Jackson.
In the case of Jackson term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums.
For annuity and interest-sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with a combination of historical and future expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
Expected gross profits also depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual mortality, lapse and expense experience is performed using internally developed experience studies.
Acquisition costs for Jacksons variable annuity products are also amortised in line with the emergence of profits.
The measurement of amortisation depends on historical and expected future gross profits which include fees including those for guaranteed minimum death, income, or withdrawal benefits as well as components related to mortality, lapse and expense.
Mean reversion technique For variable annuity products, under US GAAP as grandfathered under IFRS 4 Jackson applies a mean reversion technique for its amortisation of deferred acquisition costs against projected gross profits.
This technique is applied with the objective of adjusting the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs that would otherwise be highly volatile due to fluctuations in the level of future gross profits arising from changes in equity market levels.
The mean reversion technique achieves this objective by applying a dynamic adjustment to the assumption for short-term future investment returns.
Under the mean reversion technique applied by Jackson, the projected level of return for each of the next five years is adjusted from period to period so that in combination with the actual rates of return for the preceding three years, including the current period, the 7.4 per cent long-term annual return gross of asset management fees and other charges to policyholders, but net of external fund management fees is realised on average over the entire eight-year period.
Projected returns after the mean reversion period revert back to the 7.4 per cent assumption.
However, to ensure that the methodology does not over anticipate a reversion to the long-term level of returns following adverse markets, the mean reversion technique has a cap and floor feature whereby the projected returns in each of the next five years can be no more than 15 per cent per annum and no less than 0 per cent per annum both gross of asset management fees and other charges to policyholders, but net of external fund management fees in each year.
Sensitivity of amortisation charge The amortisation charge to the income statement is reflected in both operating profit and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
The amortisation charge to the operating profit in a reporting period comprises: i A core amount that reflects a relatively stable proportion of underlying premiums or profit: and ii An element of acceleration or deceleration arising from market movements differing from expectations.
In periods where the cap and floor feature of the mean reversion technique are not relevant, the technique operates to dampen the second element above.
Nevertheless, extreme market movements can cause material acceleration or deceleration of amortisation in spite of this dampening effect.
Furthermore, in those periods where the cap or floor is relevant, the mean reversion technique provides no further dampening and additional volatility may result.
In 2015, the DAC amortisation charge for operating profit was determined after including a charge for accelerated amortisation of 2 million 2014: charge for accelerated amortisation of 13 million.
The 2015 amount primarily reflects the offsetting impacts of the separate account performance of negative 2 per cent, which is lower than the assumed level for the year, and the effect of releasing the 2012 fund returns of 11 per cent from the mean reversion formula.
As noted above, the application of the mean reversion formula has the effect of dampening the impact of equity market movements on DAC amortisation while the mean reversion assumption lies within the corridor.
In 2016, it would take approximate movements in separate account values of more than either negative 17 per cent or positive 67 per cent for the mean reversion assumption to move outside the corridor.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 243 C:  C7:  C7.1  Detailed analyses of sensitivity of IFRS basis profit or loss and shareholders equity to key market and other risks by business unit are provided in notes C7.2, C7.3, C7.4 and C7.5.
The sensitivity analyses provided show the effect on profit or loss and shareholders equity to changes in the relevant risk variables, all of which are reasonably possible at the relevant balance sheet date.
In the equity risk sensitivity analysis shown below, the Group has considered the impact of an instantaneous 20 per cent fall in equity markets.
If equity markets were to fall by more than 20 per cent, the Group believes that this would not be an instantaneous fall but rather this would be expected to occur over a period of time during which the Group would be able to put mitigating management actions in place.
In addition, the equity risk sensitivity analysis provided assumed that all equity indices fall by the same percentage.
 The Group enjoys significant diversification benefits achieved through the geographical spread of the Groups operations and, within those operations through a broad mix of product types.
This arises because not all risk scenarios are likely to happen at the same time and across all geographic regions.
Relevant correlation factors include: Correlation across geographic regions: Financial risk factors: and Non-financial risk factors.
Correlation across risk factors: Longevity risk: Expenses: Persistency: and Other risks.
The effect of diversification across the Groups life businesses is to significantly reduce the aggregate standalone volatility risk to IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The effect is almost wholly explained by the correlations across risk types, in particular mortality and longevity risk.
C7.2   The Asia operations sell with-profits and unit-linked policies and, although the with-profits business generally has a lower terminal bonus element than in the UK, the investment portfolio still contains a proportion of equities.
Non-participating business is largely backed by debt securities or deposits.
The Groups exposure to market risk arising from its Asia operations is therefore at modest levels.
This reflects the fact that the Asia operations have a balanced portfolio of with-profits, unit-linked and other types of business.
In Asia, adverse persistency experience can impact the IFRS profitability of certain types of business written in the region.
This risk is managed at a business unit level through regular monitoring of experience and the implementation of management actions as necessary.
These actions could include product enhancements, increased management focus on premium collection as well as other customer retention efforts.
The potential financial impact of lapses is often mitigated through the specific features of the products, eg surrender charges, or through the availability of premium holiday or partial withdrawal policy features.
In summary, for Asia operations, the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is mainly affected by the impact of market levels on unit-linked persistency, and other insurance risks.
At the total IFRS profit level the Asia result is affected by short-term value movements on the asset portfolio for non-linked shareholder-backed business.
i Sensitivity to risks other than foreign exchange risk With-profits business Similar principles to those explained for UK with-profits business in note C7.4 apply to profit emergence for the Asia with-profits business.
Correspondingly, the profit emergence reflects bonus declaration and is relatively insensitive to period by period fluctuations in insurance risk or interest rate movements.
Unit-linked business As for the UK insurance operations, for unit-linked business, the main factor affecting the profit and shareholders equity of the Asia operations is investment performance through asset management fees.
The sensitivity of profits and shareholders equity to changes in insurance risk, interest rate risk and credit risk are not material.
Other business Interest rate risk Excluding its with-profits and unit-linked businesses, the results of the Asia business are sensitive to the vagaries of routine movements in interest rates.
244 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information For the purposes of analysing sensitivity to variations in interest rates, reference has been made to the movements in the 10-year government bond rates of the territories.
At 31 December 2015, 10-year government bond rates vary from territory to territory and range from 1.0 per cent to 8.9 per cent 2014: 1.6 per cent to 8.0 per cent.
For the sensitivity analysis as shown in the table below, the reasonably possible interest rate movement used is 1.0 per cent for all territories.
The estimated sensitivity to the decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2015 and 2014 is as follows: 2015 m 2014 m Decrease Increase Decrease Increase of1% of1% of1% of1% Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 185 339 54 137 Related deferred tax where applicable 34 59 5 24 Net effect on profit and shareholders equity 151 280 59 113 The pre-tax impacts, if they arose, would mostly be recorded within the category short-term fluctuations in investments returns in the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax.
The degree of sensitivity of the results of the non-linked shareholder-backed business of the Asia operations to movements in interest rates depends upon the degree to which the liabilities under the grandfathered IFRS 4 measurement basis reflects market interest rates from period to period.
For example for those countries, such as those applying US GAAP, the results can be more sensitive as the effect of interest rate movements on the backing investments may not be offset by liability movements.
In addition, the degree of sensitivity of the results shown in the table above is dependent on the interest rate level at that point of time.
The low interest rates in certain countries have had an adverse impact on the degree of sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates.
An additional factor to the direction of the sensitivity of the Asia operations as a whole is movement in the country mix.
Equity price risk The non-linked shareholder business has limited exposure to equity and property investment 31 December 2015: 840 million.
Generally changes in equity and property investment values are not directly offset by movements in policyholder liabilities.
The estimated sensitivity to a 10 per cent and 20 per cent change in equity and property prices for shareholder-backed Asia other business, which would be reflected in the short-term fluctuations component of the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax, at 31 December 2015 and 2014 would be as follows: 2015 m 2014 m Decrease Decrease of20% of10% of20% of10% Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 169 85 187 93 Related deferred tax where applicable 21 10 23 11 Net effect on profit and shareholders equity 148 75 164 82 A 10 or 20 per cent increase in their value would have an approximately equal and opposite effect on profit and shareholders equity to the sensitivities shown above.
The market risk sensitivities shown above reflect the impact of temporary market movements and, therefore, the primary effect of such movements would, in the Groups segmental analysis of profits, be included within the short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
Insurance risk Many of the territories in Asia are exposed to mortality morbidity risk and provision is made within policyholder liabilities on a prudent regulatory basis to cover the potential exposure.
If these prudent assumptions were strengthened by 5 per cent then it is estimated that post-tax profit and shareholders equity would be decreased by approximately 43 million 2014: 40 million.
Mortality and morbidity have a symmetrical effect on the portfolio and any weakening of these assumptions would have a similar equal and opposite impact.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 245 C:  C7:  C7.2  ii Sensitivity to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Asia insurance operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
For 2015, the rates for the most significant operations are given in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase strengthening of the pound sterling or decrease weakening of the pound sterling in these rates would have reduced or increased profit before tax attributable to shareholders, profit for the year and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill attributable to Asia operations respectively as follows: A10% A10% toexchangerates toexchangerates 2015 m 2014 m 2015 m 2014 m Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 94 111 115 135 Profit for the year 79 95 97 117 Shareholders equity, excluding goodwill, attributable to Asia operations 367 315 449 384 C7.3   At the level of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns, Jacksons results are sensitive to market conditions to the extent of income earned on spread-based products and indirectly in respect of variable annuity asset management fees.
Jacksons main exposures are to market risk through its exposure to interest rate risk and equity risk.
Approximately 92 per cent 2014: 94 per cent of its general account investments support fixed interest rate and fixed index annuities, variable annuity fixed account deposits and guarantees, life business and surplus and 8 per cent 2014: 6 per cent support institutional businesses.
All of these types of business contain considerable interest rate guarantee features and, consequently, require that the assets that support them are primarily fixed income or fixed maturity.
Jackson is exposed primarily to the following risks: Risks Riskofloss Equity risk related to the incidence of benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuity contracts: and related to meeting contractual accumulation requirements in fixed index annuity contracts.
Interest rate risk related to meeting guaranteed rates of accumulation on fixed annuity products following a sharp and sustained fall in interest rates: related to increases in the present value of projected benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuity contracts following a sharp and sustained fall in interest rates in conjunction with a fall in equity markets: related to the surrender value guarantee features attached to the Companys fixed annuity products and to policyholder withdrawals following a sharp and sustained increase in interest rates: and the risk of mismatch between the expected duration of certain annuity liabilities and prepayment risk and extension risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities.
Jacksons derivative programme is used to manage interest rate risk associated with a broad range of products and equity market risk attaching to its equity-based products.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads materially affect the carrying value of derivatives which are used to manage the liabilities to policyholders and backing investment assets.
Combined with the use of US GAAP measurement as grandfathered under IFRS 4 for the insurance contracts assets and liabilities which is largely insensitive to current period market movements, the Jackson total profit ie including short-term fluctuations in investment returns is sensitive to market movements.
In addition to these effects the Jackson shareholders equity is sensitive to the impact of interest rate and credit spread movements on the value of fixed income securities.
Movements in unrealised appreciation on these securities are included as movement in shareholders equity ie outside the income statement.
246 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Jackson enters into financial derivative transactions, including those noted below to reduce and manage business risks.
These transactions manage the risk of a change in the value, yield, price, cash flows or quantity of, or a degree of exposure with respect to assets, liabilities or future cash flows, which Jackson has acquired or incurred.
Jackson uses free-standing derivative instruments for hedging purposes.
Additionally, certain liabilities, primarily trust instruments supported by funding agreements, fixed index annuities, certain Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit variable annuity features and reinsured Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit variable annuity features contain embedded derivatives as defined by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Jackson does not account for such derivatives as either fair value or cash flow hedges as might be permitted if the specific hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were followed.
Financial derivatives, including derivatives embedded in certain host liabilities that have been separated for accounting and financial reporting purposes are carried at fair value.
Value movements on the derivatives are reported within the income statement.
In preparing Jacksons segment profit as shown in note B1.1 value movements on Jacksons derivative contracts, are included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns and excluded from operating results based on longer-term investment returns.
The principal types of derivatives used by Jackson and their purpose are as follows: Derivative Purpose Interest rate swaps These generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating payments over the period for which Jackson holds the instrument without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.
These agreements are used for hedging purposes.
Swaption contracts These contracts provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to require the writer to pay the present value of a long-duration interest rate swap at future exercise dates.
Jackson both purchases and writes swaptions in order to hedge against significant movements in interest rates.
Equity index futures contracts These derivatives including various call and put options and interest rate contingent options are used and equity index options to hedge Jacksons obligations associated with its issuance of certain VA guarantees.
Some of these annuities and guarantees contain embedded options which are fair valued for financial reporting purposes.
Cross-currency swaps Cross-currency swaps, which embody spot and forward currency swaps and additionally, in some cases, interest rate swaps and equity index swaps, are entered into for the purpose of hedging Jacksons foreign currency denominated funding agreements supporting trust instrument obligations.
Credit default swaps These swaps, represent agreements under which Jackson has purchased default protection on certain underlying corporate bonds held in its portfolio.
These contracts allow Jackson to sell the protected bonds at par value to the counterparty if a default event occurs in exchange for periodic payments made by Jackson for the life of the agreement.
Jackson does not write default protection using credit derivatives.
The estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit and shareholders equity to equity and interest rate risks provided below is net of the related changes in amortisation of DAC.
The effect on the related changes in amortisation of DAC provided is based on the current grandfathered US GAAP DAC basis but does not include any effect from an acceleration or deceleration of amortisation of DAC.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 247 C:  C7:  C7.3  i Sensitivity to equity risk At 31 December 2015 and 2014, Jackson had variable annuity contracts with guarantees, for which the net amount at risk NAR is defined as the amount of guaranteed benefit in excess of current account value, as follows: Period Net Weighted until Minimum Account amount average expected return value atrisk attainedage annuitisation 31December2015 m m Return of net deposits plus a minimum return GMDB 0-6% 70,732 2,614 65.3 years GMWB Premium only 0% 1,916 56 GMWB 0-5% 229 23 GMAB Premium only 0% 45 Highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 7,008 587 65.4 years GMWB Highest anniversary only 2,025 202 GMWB 698 101 Combination net deposits plus minimum return, highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 0-6% 4,069 640 68.3 years GMIB 0-6% 1,422 518 0.5 years GMWB 0-8% 63,924 7,758 Period Net Weighted until Minimum Account amount average expected return value atrisk attainedage annuitisation 31December2014 m m Return of net deposits plus a minimum return GMDB 0-6% 64,344 1,463 65.0 years GMWB Premium only 0% 2,151 32 GMWB 0-5% 264 17 GMAB Premium only 0% 53 Highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 6,581 193 65.0 years GMWB Highest anniversary only 2,131 85 GMWB 830 58 Combination net deposits plus minimum return, highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 0-6% 3,978 302 67.5 years GMIB 0-6% 1,595 360 1.4 years GMWB 0-8% 57,323 2,033    NAR, andaforlifeportion  .
248 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Account balances of contracts with guarantees were invested in variable separate accounts as follows: 2015 m 2014 m Mutual fund type: Equity 55,488 50,071 Bond 11,535 11,139 Balanced 13,546 12,901 Money market 832 675 Total 81,401 74,786 As noted above, Jackson is exposed to equity risk through the options embedded in the fixed index annuity liabilities and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit guarantees included in certain variable annuity benefits as illustrated above.
This risk is managed using an equity hedging programme to minimise the risk of a significant economic impact as a result of increases or decreases in equity market levels while taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures in Jacksons operations.
Jackson purchases external futures and options that hedge the risks inherent in these products, while also considering the impact of rising and falling guaranteed benefit fees.
As a result of this hedging programme, if the equity markets were to increase further in the future, the net effect of Jacksons free-standing derivatives would decrease in value.
However, over time, this movement would be broadly offset by increased separate account fees and reserve decreases, net of the related changes to amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
Due to the nature of the free-standing and embedded derivatives, this hedge, while highly effective on an economic basis, may not completely mute in the financial reporting the immediate impact of equity market movements as the free-standing derivatives reset immediately while the hedged liabilities reset more slowly and fees are recognised prospectively.
The opposite impact would be observed if the equity markets were to decrease.
In addition to the exposure explained above, Jackson is also exposed to equity risk from its holding of equity securities, partnerships in investment pools and other financial derivatives.
At 31 December 2015, the estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit and shareholders equity to immediate increases and decreases in equity markets is shown below.
The sensitivities are shown net of related changes in DAC amortisation.

The above table provides sensitivity movements as at a point in time while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon the volume of new product sales and lapses, changes to the derivative portfolio, correlation of market returns and various other factors including volatility, interest rates and elapsed time.
The directional movements in the sensitivities reflect the hedging programme in place at 31 December 2015 and 2014. www.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 249 C:  C7:  C7.3  ii Sensitivity to interest rate risk Notwithstanding the market risk exposure previously described, except in the circumstances of interest rate scenarios where the guarantee rates included in contract terms are higher than crediting rates that can be supported from assets held to cover liabilities, the accounting measurement of fixed annuity liabilities of Jackson products is not generally sensitive to interest rate risk.
This position derives from the nature of the products and the US GAAP basis of measurement.
The Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit features attached to variable annuity business other than for life components are accounted for as embedded derivatives which are fair valued and, therefore, will be sensitive to changes in interest rate.
Debt securities and related derivatives are marked to fair value.
Value movements on derivatives, again net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within the income statement.
Fair value movements on debt securities, net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within other comprehensive income.
The estimated sensitivity of these items and policyholder liabilities to a 1 per cent and 2 per cent decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2015 and 2014 is as follows: 2015 m 2014 m Decrease Increase Decrease Increase of2% of1% of1% of2% of2% of1% of1% of2% Profit and loss: Pre-tax profit effect net of related changes in amortisation of DAC 1,776 847 628 1,120 1,398 690 494 875 Related effect on charge for deferred tax 621 296 220 392 489 242 173 306 Net profit effect 1,155 551 408 728 909 448 321 569 Other comprehensive income: Direct effect on carrying value of debt securities net of related changes in amortisation of DAC 3,167 1,782 1,782 3,167 2,979 1,663 1,663 2,979 Related effect on movement in deferred tax 1,108 624 624 1,108 1,043 582 582 1,043 Net effect 2,059 1,158 1,158 2,059 1,936 1,081 1,081 1,936 Total net effect on shareholders equity 904 607 750 1,331 1,027 633 760 1,367 These sensitivities are shown only for interest rates in isolation and do not include other movements in credit risk that may affect credit spreads and valuations of debt securities.
Similar to sensitivity to equity risk, the sensitivity movements provided in the table above are at a point in time and reflect the hedging programme in place on the balance sheet date, while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon a number of factors.
iii Sensitivity to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Groups US operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
For 2015, the average and closing rates were US$1.53 2014: US$1.65 and US$1.47 2014: US$1.56 to 1.00 sterling, respectively.

As with other shareholder-backed business the profit or loss for Jackson is presented by distinguishing the result for the year between an operating result based on longer-term investment returns and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In this way the most significant direct effect of market changes that have taken place to the Jackson result are separately identified.
The principal determinants of variations in operating profit based on longer-term returns are: Growth in the size of assets under management covering the liabilities for the contracts in force: Variations in fees and other income, offset by variations in market value adjustment payments and, where necessary, strengthening of liabilities: Spread returns for the difference between investment returns and rates credited to policyholders: and Amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
For annuity and interest sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For interest-sensitive business, the key assumption is the expected long-term spread between the earned rate and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual experience is measured by internally developed expense, mortality and persistency studies.
Except to the extent of mortality experience, which primarily affects profits through variations in claim payments and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit reserves, the profits of Jackson are relatively insensitive to changes in insurance risk.
Jackson is sensitive to lapse risk and other types of policyholder behaviour, such as the take-up of its Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit product features.
In the absence of hedging, equity and interest rate movements can both cause a loss directly and cause an increased future sensitivity to policyholder behaviour.
Jackson has an extensive derivative programme that seeks to manage the exposure to such altered equity markets and interest rates.
For variable annuity business, the key assumption is the expected long-term level of separate account returns, which for 2015 was 7.4 per cent 2014: 7.4 per cent.
The impact of using this return is reflected in two principal ways, namely: Through the projected expected gross profits which are used to determine the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
This is applied through the use of a mean reversion technique which is described in more detail in note C5.1 b above: and The required level of provision for claims for guaranteed minimum death, for life withdrawal, and income benefits.
C7.4   The IFRS basis results of the UK insurance operations are most sensitive to asset liability matching, mortality and default rate experience and longevity assumptions and the difference between the return on corporate bond and risk-free rate for shareholder-backed annuity business of Prudential Retirement Income Limited and the Prudential Assurance Company non-profit sub-fund.
Further details are described below.
The IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for UK insurance operations is sensitive to changes in longevity assumptions affecting the carrying value of liabilities to policyholders for UK shareholder-backed annuity business.
At the total IFRS profit level, the result is particularly sensitive to temporary value movements on assets backing the capital of the shareholder-backed annuity business.
With-profits business SAIF Shareholders have no interest in the profits of the ring-fenced fund of SAIF but are entitled to the asset management fees paid on the assets of the fund.
With-profits sub-fund business The shareholder results of the UK with-profits business including non-participating annuity business of the with-profits sub-fund are only sensitive to market risk through the indirect effect of investment performance on declared policyholder bonuses.
The investment assets of PAC with-profits funds are subject to market risk.
Changes in their carrying value, net of related changes to asset-share liabilities of with-profits contracts, affect the level of unallocated surplus of the fund.
Therefore, the level of unallocated surplus is particularly sensitive to the level of investment returns on the portion of the assets that represents surplus.
However, as unallocated surplus is accounted for as a liability under IFRS, movements in its value do not affect shareholders profit and equity.
The shareholder results of the UK with-profits fund correspond to the shareholders share of the cost of bonuses declared on the with-profits business which is currently one-ninth of the cost of bonuses declared.
Investment performance is a key driver of bonuses, and hence the shareholders share of the cost of bonuses.
Due to the smoothed basis of bonus declaration, the sensitivity to investment performance in a single year is low relative to movements in the period-to-period performance.
However, over multiple periods, it is important as it may affect future expected shareholder transfers.
Mortality and other insurance risk are relatively minor factors in the determination of the bonus rates.
Adverse persistency experience can affect the level of profitability from with-profits but in any given one year, the shareholders share of cost of bonus may only be marginally affected.
However, altered persistency trends may affect future expected shareholder transfers.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 251 C:  C7:  C7.4   The principal items affecting the IFRS results of the UK shareholder-backed annuity business are mortality experience and assumptions, and credit risk.
The assets covering the liabilities are principally debt securities and other investments that are held to match the expected duration and payment characteristics of the policyholder liabilities.
These liabilities are valued for IFRS reporting purposes by applying discount rates that reflect the market rates of return attaching to the covering assets.
Except to the extent of any asset liability duration mismatch which is reviewed regularly, and exposure to credit risk, the sensitivity of the Groups results to market risk for movements in the carrying value of the liabilities and covering assets is broadly neutral on a net basis.
The main market risk sensitivity for the UK shareholder-backed annuity business arises from interest rate risk on the debt securities which substantially represent shareholders equity.
This shareholders equity comprises the net assets held within the long-term fund of the Company that cover regulatory basis liabilities that are not recognised for IFRS reporting purposes, for example contingency reserves, and shareholder capital held outside the long-term fund.
In summary, profits from shareholder-backed annuity business are most sensitive to: The extent to which the duration of the assets held closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities under the contracts: Actual versus expected default rates on assets held: The difference between long-term rates of return on corporate bonds and risk-free rates: The variance between actual and expected mortality experience: The extent to which changes to the assumed rate of improvements in mortality give rise to changes in the measurement of liabilities: and Changes in renewal expense levels.
In addition, the level of profit is affected by change in the level of reinsurance cover.
A decrease in assumed mortality rates of 1 per cent would decrease pre-tax profit by approximately 67 million 2014: 94 million.
A decrease in credit default assumptions of five basis points would increase pre-tax profit by 176 million 2014: 190 million.
A decrease in renewal expenses excluding asset management expenses of 5 per cent would increase pre-tax profit by 35 million 2014: 30 million.
The effect on profit would be approximately symmetrical for changes in assumptions that are directionally opposite to those explained above.
The net effect on profit after tax and shareholders equity from all the changes in assumptions as described above would be an increase of approximately 115 million 2014: 101 million.
Unit-linked and other business Unit-linked and other business represents a comparatively small proportion of the in-force business of the UK insurance operations.
Due to the matching of policyholder liabilities to attaching asset value movements the UK unit-linked business is not directly affected by market or credit risk.
The liabilities of the other business are also broadly insensitive to market risk.
Profits from unit-linked and similar contracts primarily arise from the excess of charges to policyholders for management of assets, over expenses incurred.
The former is most sensitive to the net accretion of funds under management as a function of new business and lapse and timing of death.
The accounting impact of the latter is dependent upon the amortisation of acquisition costs in line with the emergence of margins for insurance contracts and amortisation in line with service provision for the investment management component of investment contracts.
By virtue of the design features of most of the contracts which provide low levels of mortality cover, the profits are relatively insensitive to changes in mortality experience.
Sensitivity to interest rate risk and other market risk By virtue of the fund structure, product features and basis of accounting, the policyholder liabilities of the UK insurance operations are, except annuity business, not generally exposed to interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2015 annuity liabilities accounted for 98 per cent 2014: 98 per cent of UK shareholder-backed business liabilities.
For annuity business, liabilities are exposed to interest rate risk.
However, the net exposure to the Prudential Assurance Company with-profits sub-fund for its non-profit annuity business and shareholders for annuity liabilities of Prudential Retirement Income Limited and the non-profit sub-fund is very substantially ameliorated by virtue of the close matching of assets with appropriate duration.
The level of matching from period to period can vary depending on management actions and economic factors so it is possible for a degree of mis-matching profits or losses to arise.
The close matching by the Group of assets of appropriate duration to annuity liabilities is based on maintaining economic and regulatory capital.
The measurement of liabilities under capital reporting requirements and IFRS is not the same with contingency reserves and some other margins for prudence within the assumptions required under the regulatory solvency basis not included for IFRS reporting purposes.
As a result IFRS equity is higher than regulatory capital and therefore more sensitive to interest rate and credit risk.

Excluding any second order effects on the measurement of the liabilities for future cash flows to the policyholder, a fall in their value would have given rise to the following effects on pre-tax profit, profit after tax and shareholders equity.

The market risk sensitivities shown above reflect the impact of temporary market movements, and, therefore the primary effect of such movements would, in the Groups segmental analysis of profits, be included within the short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
C7.5  a Assetmanagement i Sensitivities to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
The rates for the functional currencies of most significant operations are shown in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase in the relevant exchange rates strengthening of the pound sterling would have reduced reported profit before tax attributable to shareholders and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill attributable to Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations, by 11 million and 38 million respectively 2014: 9 million and 33 million, respectively.
ii Sensitivities to other financial risks for asset management operations The principal sensitivities to other financial risk of asset management operations are credit risk on the bridging loan portfolio of the Prudential Capital operation and the indirect effect of changes to market values of funds under management.
Due to the nature of the asset management operations there is limited direct sensitivity to movements in interest rates.
Total debt securities held at 31 December 2015 by asset management operations were 2,204 million 2014: 2,293 million, the majority of which are held by the Prudential Capitals operation.
Debt securities held by Prudential Capital are in general variable rate bonds and so market value is limited in sensitivity to interest rate movements and consequently any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on profit or shareholders equity.
The Groups asset management operations do not hold significant investments in property or equities.
b Otheroperations The Group holds certain derivatives that are used to manage foreign currency movements and macroeconomic exposures.
The fair value of these derivatives is sensitive to the combined effect of movements in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation rates.
The possible permutations cover a wide range of scenarios.
For indicative purposes, a reasonably possible range of fair value movements could be plus or minus 150 million.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 253 C:  C8:  C8.1 Deferredtax The statement of financial position contains the following deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to: Deferredtaxassets  2015 m 2014 m 2015 m 2014 m Unrealised losses or gains on investments 21 83 1,036 1,697 Balances relating to investment and insurance contracts 1 4 543 499 Short-term temporary differences 2,752 2,607 2,400 2,065 Capital allowances 10 9 31 30 Unused deferred tax losses 35 62 Total 2,819 2,765 4,010 4,291 The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2015 and 2014 arises in the following parts of the Group: 2015 m 2014 m Asia insurance operations 66 84 US insurance operations 2,448 2,343 UK insurance operations SAIF 1 PAC with-profits fund including non-profit annuity business 83 71 Other 48 61 Other operations 173 206 Total 2,819 2,765 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable, that is to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
The taxation regimes applicable across the Group often apply separate rules to trading and capital profits and losses.
The distinction between temporary differences that arise from items of either a trading or capital nature may affect the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, for the 2015 results and financial position at 31 December 2015 the possible tax benefit of approximately 98 million 2014: 110 million, which may arise from capital losses valued at approximately 0.5 billion 2014: 0.5 billion, is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
In addition, a potential deferred tax asset of 52 million 2014: 47 million, which may arise from trading tax losses and other potential temporary differences totalling 0.3 billion 2014: 0.2 billion is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
Of these, losses of 36 million will expire within the next seven years.
Of the remaining losses, 1 million will expire within 20 years and the rest have no expiry date.
The table that follows provides a breakdown of the recognised deferred tax assets set out in the table above for both the short-term temporary differences and unused tax losses split by business unit.
The table also shows the period of estimated recoverability for each respective business unit.
For these and each category of deferred tax asset recognised their recoverability against forecast taxable profits is not significantly impacted by any current proposed changes to future accounting standards.

The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and a further reduction to 18 per cent from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 which has had the effect of reducing the UK with-profits and shareholder-backed business element of the deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2015 by 17 million and the effects of these changes are reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.

C9:  a  The Groups businesses operate a number of pension schemes.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which the employees are located, although they are, in general, funded by the Group and based either on a cash balance formula or on years of service and salary earned in the last year or years of employment.
The largest defined benefit scheme is the principal UK scheme, namely the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
PSPS accounts for 84 per cent 2014: 84 per cent of the underlying scheme liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The Group also operates two smaller UK defined benefit schemes in respect of Scottish Amicable SASPS and M&G M&GGPS.
In addition, there are two small defined benefit schemes in Taiwan which have negligible deficits.
Under the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation basis, the Group applies the principles of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, whereby a surplus is only recognised to the extent that the Company is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund to the surplus or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service, which have been substantively enacted or contractually agreed.
Further, the IFRS financial position recorded, reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and any obligation for committed deficit funding where applicable.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 255 C:  C9:  a   The last completed actuarial valuation of PSPS was as at 5 April 2014 by CG Singer, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, of Towers Watson Limited.
This valuation was finalised in the first half of 2015 and demonstrated the scheme to be 107 per cent funded by reference to the Scheme Solvency Target that forms the basis of the schemes funding objective.
The contributions into the scheme are payable at the minimum level required under the scheme rules.
Excluding expenses, the contributions are payable at approximately 6 million per annum for ongoing service of active members of the scheme.
No deficit or other funding is required.
Deficit funding for PSPS, when applicable, is apportioned in the ratio of 70 30 between the PAC with-profits fund and shareholder-backed operations based on the sourcing of previous contributions.
Employer contributions for ongoing service of current employees are apportioned in the ratio relevant to current activity.
The last completed actuarial valuation of SASPS was as at 31 March 2014 by Jonathan Seed, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, of Xafinity Consulting Limited.
This valuation was finalised in the first half of 2015 and demonstrated the scheme to be 78 per cent funded.
It has been agreed with the Trustees that the level of deficit funding be increased from the previous level of 13.1 million per annum to 21.0 million per annum from 1 January 2015 until 31 March 2024, or earlier if the schemes funding level reaches 100 per cent before this date, to eliminate the actuarial deficit.
The deficit funding will be reviewed every three years at subsequent valuations.
The last completed actuarial valuation of M&GGPS was as at 31 December 2014 by Paul Belok, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, of AON Hewitt Limited.
This valuation was finalised in the second half of 2015 and demonstrated the scheme to be 98.6 per cent funded.
It has been agreed with the Trustees that no deficit funding is required from 1 January 2016.
Deficit funding of 9.3 million was paid in 2015 2014: 18.6 million.
Defined benefit pension schemes in the UK are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuations every three years in order to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes in relation to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
For PSPS, the market value of the scheme assets as at the 5 April 2014 valuation was 6,165 million.
The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the purposes of the 2014 valuation were as follows.
% Rate of increase in salaries Nil Rate of inflation: Retail Prices Index RPI 3.5 Consumer Prices Index CPI 2.8 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.8 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 Discretionary Nil Expected returns on plan assets 3.3 Mortality assumptions: The tables used for PSPS pensions in payment at 5 April 2014 were: Base post-retirement mortality For current male female pensioners 113% 108% of the mortality rates of the 2000 series mortality tables PNMA00 PNFA00, published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI.
For male female non-pensioners 107% 92% of the 2000 series rates PNMA00 PNFA00.
Allowance for future improvements to post-retirement mortality For males females up to 2009 100% 75% of Medium Cohort subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 2.00% pa 1.25% pa up to age 90, decreasing linearly to zero by age 120.
From 2010 onwards, in line with the CMIs 2009 projection model with a long-term rate of 1.75% pa 1.50% pa, and minor scheme-specific calibrations.
 Responsibility of making good of any deficit that may arise in the schemes lies with the employers of the schemes, which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Accordingly, the pension schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are interest rate and investment risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Corporategovernance The Groups UK pension schemes are regulated by The Pension Regulator in accordance with the Pension Act 1995.
Trustees have been appointed for each pension scheme and they have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the scheme is managed in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules.
All three of the Groups UK defined benefit pension schemes the PSPS, SASPS and M&GGPS are final salary schemes, which are closed to new entrants.
The Trustee sets the general investment policy and specifies any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the benchmark, but delegates the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the Investment Managers.
The Trustee consults the Principal Employer, the Prudential Assurance Company, on the investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the assets of the scheme lies with the Trustee.
The Trustee of each of the schemes manages the investment strategy of the scheme to achieve an acceptable balance between investing in the assets that most closely match the expected benefit payments and assets that are expected to achieve a greater return in the hope of reducing the contributions required or providing additional benefits to members.
The PSPS scheme has entered into a derivatives based strategy to match the duration and inflation profile of its liabilities.
This involved a reallocation from other investments to other assets with an interest and inflation swap overlay.
As at 31 December 2015, the nominal value of the interest and inflation-linked swaps amounted to 0.7 billion 2014: 0.8 billion and 3.4 billion 2014: 3.0 billion respectively.
The SASPS and M&GGPS use very limited or no derivatives to manage their risks.
b Assumptions The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended 31 December were as follows: 2015 % 2014 % Discount rate 3.8 3.5 Rate of increase in salaries 3.0 3.0 Rate of inflation Retail prices index RPI 3.0 3.0 Consumer prices index CPI 2.0 2.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: PSPS: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.5 2.5 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Other schemes 3.0 3.0 , ,  .
The calculations are based on current mortality estimates with an allowance made for future improvements in mortality.
The allowance made is in line with a custom calibration and was updated in 2014 to reflect the 2012 mortality model from the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries CMI.
For the PSPS immediate annuities in payment, in 2015 and 2014, a long-term improvement rate of 1.75 per cent per annum and 1.25 per cent per annum were applied for males and females, respectively.
c  This section illustrates the financial position of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes on an economic basis and the IAS 19 basis.
The underlying pension position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
The IAS 19 basis excludes the investments in Prudential policies.
At 31 December 2015, the investments in Prudential insurance policies comprise 125 million 2014: 131 million for PSPS and 77 million 2014: 132 million for the M&GGPS.
In principle, on consolidation the investments are eliminated against policyholder liabilities of UK insurance operations, so that the formal IAS 19 position for the scheme in isolation excludes these items.
This treatment applies to the M&GGPS investments.
However, as a substantial portion of the Companys interest in the underlying surplus of PSPS is not recognised, the adjustment is not necessary for the PSPS investments.

c Basisofpreparation,  Each of the Groups long-term business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
Details by the Groups major operations are shown below.
i Asia insurance operations The available capital shown above of 5,177 million 2014: 4,823 million represents the excess of local regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of required capital of 1,622 million 2014: 1,514 million.
The businesses in Asia are subject to local capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
For material Asia operations, the details of the basis of determining regulatory capital and regulatory capital requirements are as follows: Hong Kong For non-participating business, mathematical reserves are generally calculated using a modified net premium approach with no allowance for future discontinuance.
The underlying assumptions are based on a best estimate basis with prudent margins for adverse deviations.
Cash flows are discounted at a valuation interest rate based on a blend between the risk-adjusted portfolio yield and reinvestment rate.
For participating business, mathematical reserves are based on the guaranteed benefits only and use a modified net premium approach with no allowance for future discontinuances.
Similar to above, the underlying assumptions are based on a best estimate basis with prudent margins for adverse deviations with the valuation interest rate being a blend of the risk-adjusted portfolio yield and the reinvestment rate.
For linked business, the value of units is held together with the non-unit reserves calculated in accordance with the standard actuarial methodology and prevailing regulations.
The capital requirement for solvency margin calculation varies by underlying risk and duration of liabilities but is generally determined as 4 per cent of mathematical reserves plus 0.3 per cent of the capital at risk.
Indonesia Solvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach.
Insurance companies in Indonesia are expected to maintain the level of net assets above 120 per cent of solvency capital.
Policy reserves for traditional business are determined on a gross premium reserve basis using prudent best estimate assumptions.
For linked business, the value of the units are maintained with a non-unit reserve which is calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
Korea A risk-based capital framework applies in Korea.
Policy reserves for traditional business are determined on a net premium reserve basis using standard mortality and prescribed standard interest rates.
For linked business, the value of the units are held together with the non-unit reserves and calculated in accordance with the local regulators standard actuarial methodology.
Under the risk-based capital solvency requirement, the ratio of an insurers available capital to required capital is calculated and the analysis of equity capital used to determine capital adequacy must take into account market, credit, operational, insurance and interest rate risks.
The scheme requires the ratio be calculated based on integrated financial statements reflecting assets, liabilities and capital of affiliates and subsidiaries.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 263 C:  C11:  C11.1  Malaysia A risk-based capital framework applies in Malaysia.
For participating business, a gross premium reserve on the guaranteed and non-guaranteed benefits determined using best estimate assumptions is held.
The amount held is subject to a minimum of a gross premium reserve on the guaranteed benefits, determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions of risk margin for adverse deviations discounted at the risk-free rate.
For non-participating business, gross premium reserves are determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions for risk margin for adverse deviations.
For linked business, the value of units is held together with a non-unit reserve calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
Participating fund surplus is not allowed to be used to support a deficit if any and the capital requirement of the non-participating business.
The capital requirement is calculated based on a prescribed series of risk charges.
The local regulator has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken.
Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.
Singapore A risk-based capital framework applies in Singapore.
For participating business, a gross premium reserve, determined using prudent best estimate assumptions and which makes allowance for future bonus, is held.
The amount held is subject to a minimum of the higher of the assets attributed to participating business and a gross premium reserve calculated on specified assumptions, but without allowance for future bonus, that includes prescribed provisions for adverse deviations PADs.
For non-participating business, gross premium reserves are held.
A registered insurer incorporated in Singapore is required at all times to maintain a minimum level of paid-up ordinary share capital and to ensure that its financial resources are not less than the greater of i the total risk requirement arising from the assets and liabilities of the insurer calculated in accordance with the Singapore Insurance Act: or ii a minimum amount of 5 million Singapore Dollars.
The regulator also has the authority to direct that the insurer satisfy additional capital adequacy requirements in addition to those set forth under the Singapore Insurance Act if it considers such additional requirements appropriate.
Thailand A risk-based capital framework applies in Thailand.
For non-participating business, the gross premium reserves are determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions of risk margin for adverse deviations discounted at the risk-free rate.
The risk-free rate is derived from the greater of the current yield curve of Thai government bonds and the weighted-average yield curve of the current and prior seven quarters of Thai government bonds, as with a greater weighting on the current quarter.
Capital adequacy is measured based on the Capital Adequacy Ratio CAR, which is determined as the Total Capital Available divided by the Total Capital Required.
Life insurers are required by law to maintain capital funds which are not less than the greater of i the sum of capital for all risks and asset as prescribed in the regulation and ii a minimum amount of 50 million Thai Baht.
Insurers are required by law to maintain capital greater than the prescribed minimum CAR of not less than 100 per cent.
However, in case the insurer has a CAR of less than 140 per cent, the regulator may intervene to oversee the insurers financial status.
Vietnam For traditional business, mathematical reserves are calculated using a modified net premium approach, set using assumptions agreed with the regulator.
For linked business, the value of units is held together with the non-unit reserves calculated in accordance with the local regulators standard actuarial methodology.
The capital requirement is determined as 4 per cent of reserves plus a specified percentage of 0.1 per cent of sums at risk for policies with original term less than or equal to five years or 0.3 per cent of sums at risk for policies with original term of more than five years.
An additional capital requirement of Vietnamese Dong 300 billion is also required for companies transacting pension business.
264 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information ii US insurance operations The regulatory framework for Jackson is governed by the requirements of the US NAIC approved Risk-Based Capital standards.
Under these requirements life insurance companies report using a formula-based capital standard which includes components calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items and a separate model-based component for market risk associated primarily with variable annuity products.
The Risk-Based Capital formula takes into account the risk characteristics of a company, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk.
The available capital of Jackson shown above of 3,466 million 2014: 3,141 million reflects US regulatory basis available capital as adjusted to exclude asset valuation reserves.
The asset valuation reserve, which is reflected as available capital, is designed to provide for future credit-related losses on debt securities and losses on equity investments.
Available capital includes a reduction for the effect of the interest maintenance reserve, which is designed by state regulators to defer recognition of non-credit related realised capital gains and losses and to recognise them ratably in the future.
Jacksons Risk-Based Capital ratio is significantly in excess of regulatory requirements.
At 31 December 2015, Jackson had a permitted practice in effect as granted by the local regulator allowing Jackson to carry certain interest rate swaps at book value, as if statutory hedge accounting were in place, instead of at fair value as would have been otherwise required.
Jackson is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its interest rate swap programme pursuant to the Michigan Insurance Code.
The total effect of this permitted practice, net of tax, was to decrease statutory surplus by 241 million at 31 December 2015.
Michigan insurance law specifically allows value of business acquired as an admitted asset as long as certain criteria are met.
US NAIC standards limit the admitted amount of goodwill value of business acquired generally to 10 per cent of capital and surplus.
At 31 December 2015, Jackson reported 222 million of statutory basis value of business acquired as a result of the REALIC acquisition, which is fully admissible under Michigan insurance law.
iii UK insurance operations In the UK, up to 31 December 2015, insurers, regulated by PRA, had to hold capital resources equal at least to the Minimum Capital Requirement MCR under the Solvency I basis.
In addition the rules required insurers to perform Individual Capital Assessments.
Under these rules insurers assessed for themselves the amount of capital needed to back their business.
If the PRA viewed the results of this assessment as insufficient, it might draw up its own Individual Capital Guidance for a firm, which could be superimposed as a requirement.
These requirements were replaced by the Solvency II regime on 1 January 2016 which is discussed further in the Strategic Report.
PAC with-profits sub-fund and Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund under Solvency I basis Under PRA Solvency I rules, insurers with with-profits liabilities of more than 500 million must hold capital equal to the higher of the MCR and the Enhanced Capital Requirement ECR.
The ECR is intended to provide a more risk responsive and realistic measure of a with-profits insurers capital requirements, whereas the MCR is broadly speaking equivalent to the previous required minimum margin under the Interim Prudential Sourcebook and satisfies the minimum EU Standards.
Available capital of the with-profits sub-fund and Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund of 7.7 billion 2014: 7.2 billion as shown in the table in section a above represents the excess of assets over liabilities on the PRA realistic basis.
Unlike the previously discussed FRS 27 basis, realistic liabilities on the regulatory basis include the shareholders share of future bonuses.
These amounts are shown before deduction of the risk capital margin as set on the PRA basis which is estimated to be 1.0 billion at 31 December 2015 2014: 1.0 billion.
Other UK life assurance subsidiaries and funds The available capital of 3,761 million 2014: 3,297 million under the Solvency I basis as shown in the table in section a above reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities of the subsidiaries and funds, before deduction of the capital resources requirement of 1,555 million 2014: 1,552 million.
The capital resources requirement for these companies broadly reflects a formula which, for active funds, equates to a percentage of regulatory reserves plus a percentage of death strains.
Death strains represent the payments made to policyholders upon death in excess of amounts explicitly allocated to fund the provisions for policyholders claims and maturities.
iv Group capital requirements In addition to the requirements at individual company level, PRA requirements apply additional prudential requirements for the Group as a whole.
Up until 31 December 2015 these requirements were under the IGD.
Solvency II, which came into force on 1 January 2016, replaces the IGD capital requirements.
Discussion of the Groups estimated IGD and Solvency II positions at 31 December 2015 is provided in the Strategic Report.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 265 C:  C11:  C11.1  d  Up until 31 December 2015, under Solvency I basis for PAC and all other UK long-term insurers, long-term business assets and liabilities must, by law, be maintained in funds separate from those for the assets and liabilities attributable to non-life insurance business or to shareholders.
Only the established surplus, the excess of assets over liabilities in the long-term fund determined through a formal valuation, may be transferred so as to be available for other purposes.
Distributions from the with-profits sub-fund to shareholders reflect the shareholders one-ninth share of the cost of declared policyholders bonuses.
Any excess of assets over liabilities of the PAC with-profits fund is retained within that fund.
The retention of the capital enables it to support with-profits and other business of the fund by, for example, providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees.
It also provides investment flexibility for the funds assets by meeting the regulatory capital requirements that demonstrate solvency and by absorbing the costs of significant events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting the bonus and investment policies.
For other UK long-term business subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels which provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the regulatory minimum.
The concept of long-term fund as described above was abolished under the Solvency II regime, which came into effect on 1 January 2016.
The PAC with-profits funds will still be treated as ring-fenced structures under the new regime.
Therefore the consideration of an established surplus that needs to be formally transferred no longer exists.
However companies as a whole will be required to meet the new capital requirements.
Further information on the Solvency II capital requirements is provided in the Strategic Report.
For Jackson, capital retention is maintained at a level consistent with an appropriate rating by Standard & Poors.
Currently Jackson is rated AA.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, dividends which exceed the greater of statutory net gain from operations less net realised investments losses for the prior year or 10 per cent of Jacksons prior year-end statutory surplus, excluding any increase arising from the application of permitted practices, require prior regulatory approval.
For Asia subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum.
For ring-fenced with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained with distribution tied to the shareholders share of bonuses through declaration of actuarially determined surplus.
The businesses in Asia may, in general, remit dividends to the UK, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the local regulatory solvency targets.
Available capital of the non-insurance business units is transferable to the life assurance businesses after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency targets, over and above basis liabilities.
e  Prudential manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities Prudential has in each business.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory requirements in which it operates, Prudential employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.
Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, Jackson and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements.
A stochastic approach models the inter-relationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.
In addition, reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the UK, US and Asian regulators.
The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the approach to asset liability management.
For example, for businesses that are most sensitive to interest rate changes, such as immediate annuity business, Prudential uses cash flow analysis to create a portfolio of debt securities whose value is expected to change in line with the value of liabilities when interest rates change.
This type of analysis helps protect profits from changing interest rates and is used in the UK for annuity business and by Jackson for its fixed interest rate and fixed index annuities and institutional products.
For businesses that are most sensitive to equity price changes, Prudential uses stochastic modelling and scenario testing to look at the future returns on its investments under different scenarios which best reflect the large diversity in returns that equities can produce.
This allows Prudential to devise an investment and with-profits policyholder bonus strategy that, based on the model assumptions, allows it to optimise returns to its policyholders and shareholders over time while maintaining appropriate financial strength.
Prudential uses this methodology extensively in connection with its UK with-profits business.
f  Should the assets of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations of the policyholders of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund, the PAC long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency in the first instance.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 269 D: Othernotes D1:  On 5 February 2015, the Group announced that it had completed the sale of its closed book life insurance business in Japan, PCA Life Insurance Company Limited to SBI Holdings, Inc. following regulatory approvals.
The transaction was announced on 16 July 2013.
Of the agreed US$85 million cash consideration, the Group received US$68 million on completion of the transaction, and a further payment of up to US$17 million will be received contingent upon the future performance of the Japan life business.
The Japan life business had been classified as held for sale on the statement of financial position of the Group since 2013.
The held for sale assets and liabilities of the Japan life business on the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2014 were as follows: 2014 m Assets Investments 898 Other assets 45 943 Adjustment for remeasurement of the carrying value to fair value less costs to sell 124 Assetsheldforsale 819 Liabilities Policyholder liabilities 717 Other liabilities 53  770 Netassets 49 Upon its classification as held for sale in 2013, the IFRS carrying value of the Japan life business was set to represent the proceeds, net of related expenses.
Subsequent remeasurement of the carrying value of the Japan life business in 2014 resulted in a charge in the income statement of 13 million in 2014.
These amounts, together with the results of the business including short-term value movements on investments also included in the income statement, netted to an insignificant amount for those periods.
On completion of the sale, the cumulative foreign exchange translation loss of the Japan life business of 46 million, that had arisen from 2004 the year of the Groups conversion to IFRS to disposal was recycled from other comprehensive income through the profit and loss account in 2015 as required by IAS 21.
This amount is included within Cumulative exchange loss on the sold Japan life business recycled from other comprehensive income in the supplementary analysis of profit of the Group as shown in note B1.1.
The adjustment has no net effect on shareholders equity.
D2:  The Group is involved in a number of litigation and regulatory issues.
These include civil proceedings involving Jackson, which appear to be substantially similar to other class action litigation brought against many life insurers in the US, alleging misconduct in the sale of insurance products.
While the outcome of such litigation and regulatory issues cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
  Jackson had previously received regulatory enquiries on an industry-wide matter regarding claims settlement practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws.
During 2015, Jackson has reached agreements to settle issues related to these enquiries.
At 31 December 2015, Jackson has accrued 16 million 2014: 13 million to cover any such liability.
 Guarantee funds in both the UK and the US provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance companies and are financed by payments assessed on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume and types of business.
The estimated reserve for future guarantee fund assessments is not significant.
The directors believe that the reserve is adequate for all anticipated payments for known insolvencies.
At 31 December 2015, Jackson has unfunded commitments of 299 million 2014: 332 million related to its investments in limited partnerships and 64 million 2014: 73 million related to commercial mortgage loans and other fixed maturities.
These commitments were entered into in the normal course of business and the directors do not expect a material adverse impact on the operations to arise from them.
The Group has provided other guarantees and commitments to third parties entered into in the normal course of business, but the Company does not consider that the amounts involved are significant.
270 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information  As a proprietary insurance company, PAC is liable to meet its obligations to policyholders even if the assets of the long-term funds are insufficient to do so.
The assets, represented by the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds, in excess of amounts expected to be paid for future terminal bonuses and related shareholder transfers the excess assets in the long-term funds could be materially depleted over time by, for example, a significant or sustained equity market downturn, costs of significant fundamental strategic change or a material increase in the pension mis-selling provision.
In the unlikely circumstance that the depletion of the excess assets within the long-term fund was such that the Groups ability to satisfy policyholders reasonable expectations was adversely affected, it might become necessary to restrict the annual distribution to shareholders or to contribute shareholders funds to the long-term funds to provide financial support.
In 1997, the business of Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society, a mutual society, was transferred to PAC with the creation of a separate sub-fund, SAIF within PACs long-term business fund containing all the with-profits business and all other pension business that was transferred.
No new business has been or will be written in the sub-fund, and it is managed to ensure that all the invested assets are distributed to SAIF policyholders over the lifetime of SAIF policies.
With the exception of certain amounts in respect of the unitised with-profits life business, all future earnings arising in SAIF are retained for SAIF policyholders.
Any excess deficiency of revenue over expense within SAIF during a period is attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of SAIF but are entitled to the asset management fees paid on this business.
SAIF with-profits policies contain minimum levels of guaranteed benefit to policyholders.
In addition, certain pensions products have guaranteed annuity rates at retirement see below.
Should the assets of SAIF be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations of the policyholders of SAIF, the PAC long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency in the first instance.
 Prudential and PAC have put in place intra-group arrangements to formalise circumstances in which capital support would be made available by Prudential including in the scenarios referred to in respect of the pension mis-selling review as referenced below.
While Prudential considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to PAC and its policyholders.
In addition, Prudential has put in place intra-group arrangements to formalise undertakings by Prudential to the regulators of the Hong Kong subsidiaries, which from 1 January 2014, contain the domesticated branch business from PAC regarding their solvency levels.
In addition, the scheme of transfer of the Hong Kong branch includes short-term support arrangements between Prudential and PAC to underpin similar arrangements between PAC and the newly domesticated business.
It is considered unlikely that support will need to be provided under these arrangements.
 Guaranteedannuities The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuities in the UK is through SAIF see above, and at 31 December 2015, a provision of 412 million was held 2014: 549 million.
However, as SAIF is a separate sub-fund of the PAC long-term business fund, attributable to the policyholders, the movement in this provision has no impact on shareholders.
In addition, PAC used to sell guaranteed annuity products in the UK and is therefore exposed to liabilities to honour guarantees on these products within the main with-profits fund for which, at 31 December 2015, a provision of 47 million was held 2014: 50 million.
 The assets of the with-profits sub-fund WPSF within the long-term insurance fund of PAC comprise the amounts that it expects to pay out to meet its obligations to existing policyholders and an additional amount used as working capital.
The amount payable over time to policyholders from the WPSF is equal to the policyholders accumulated asset shares plus any additional payments that may be required by way of smoothing or to meet guarantees.
The balance of the assets of the WPSF is called the inherited estate and has accumulated over many years from various sources.
This inherited estate enables PAC to support with-profits business by providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees, by providing investment flexibility for the funds assets, by meeting the regulatory capital requirements that demonstrate solvency and by absorbing the costs of certain significant events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting the bonus and investment policies.
The size of the inherited estate fluctuates from year to year depending on the investment return and the extent of its utilisation.
 The pensions review by the UK insurance regulator of past sales of personal pension policies required all UK life insurance companies to review their cases of potential mis-selling and record a provision for the estimated costs.
The Group met the requirement of the UK insurance regulator to issue offers to all cases by 30 June 2002.
The pension mis-selling provision is included within the policyholder liabilities of the PAC with-profits funds.
The costs associated with the pension mis-selling review have been met from the inherited estate see above and, accordingly have not been charged to the asset shares used in the determination of policyholder bonus rates.
Hence policyholders pay-out values have been unaffected by pension mis-selling.
In 1998, Prudential stated that deducting mis-selling costs from the inherited estate see above would not impact its bonus or investment policy and it gave an assurance that if this unlikely event were to occur, it would make available support to the fund from shareholder resources for as long as the situation continued, so as to ensure that policyholders were not disadvantaged.
This review was completed on 30 June 2002 with the assurance continuing to apply to any policy in force at 31 December 2003, both for premiums paid before 1 January 2004, and for subsequent regular premiums including future fixed, retail price index or salary related increases and Department of Work and Pensions rebate business.
The assurance has not applied to new business since 1 January 2004. www.

D4:  Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
The Company has transactions and outstanding balances with certain unit trusts, Open-Ended Investment Companies OEICs, collateralised debt obligations and similar entities which are not consolidated and where a Group company acts as manager which are regarded as related parties for the purposes of IAS 24.
The balances are included in the Groups statement of financial position at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with their IAS 39 classifications.
The transactions are included in the income statement and include amounts paid on issue of shares or units, amounts received on cancellation of shares or units and paid in respect of the periodic charge and administration fee.
In addition, there are no material transactions between the Groups joint ventures which are accounted for on an equity method basis and other Group companies.
Executive officers and directors of the Company may, from time to time, purchase insurance, asset management or annuity products marketed by Group companies in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons.
In 2015 and 2014, other transactions with directors were not deemed to be significant both by virtue of their size and in the context of the directors financial positions.
All these transactions are on terms broadly equivalent to those that prevail in arms-length transactions.
Apart from these transactions with directors, no director had interests in shares, transactions or arrangements that require disclosure, other than those given in the directors remuneration report.
Key management remuneration is disclosed in note B3.3.
D5: Commitments  The Group leases various offices to conduct its business.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

D6: ,  a  Certain Group subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise to the parent company.
Under UK company law, UK companies can only declare dividends if they have sufficient distributable reserves.
Further, UK insurance companies are required to maintain solvency margins in accordance with the rules of the Prudential Regulation Authority.
The Group UK asset management company, M&G Investment Management Ltd is also required to maintain capital in accordance with regulatory requirements before making any distribution to the parent company.
Jackson is subject to state laws that limit the dividends payable to its parent company based on statutory capital and surplus and prior year earnings.
Dividends in excess of these limitations require prior regulatory approval.
The Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures in Asia may remit dividends to the Group, in general, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations and has sufficient distributable reserves.
The Group capital position statement for life assurance businesses is set out in note C11.1, showing the available capital reflecting the excess of regulatory basis over liabilities for each fund or group of companies determined by reference to the local regulation of the subsidiaries as at 31 December 2015.
In addition, disclosure is also provided in note C11.1 of the local capital requirement of the principal funds and companies.

In addition, there is an asset management joint venture in Hong Kong with Bank of China International Holdings Limited BOCI and Takaful general and life insurance joint venture in Malaysia.
The Group has various joint ventures relating to property investments held by the PAC with-profits fund.
The results of these joint ventures are reflected in the movement in the unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profits funds and therefore do not affect shareholders results.
For the Groups joint ventures that are accounted for by using the equity method, the net of tax results of these operations are included in the Groups profit before tax.
The investments in these joint ventures have the same accounting year end as the Group, except for joint ventures in India.
Although these entities have reporting periods ending 31 March, 12 months of financial information up to 31 December is recorded.
Accordingly, the information covers the same period as that of the Group.
The Groups associates, which are also accounted for under the equity method include PPM South Africa and PruHealth until its sale in 2014.
In addition, the Group has investments in OEICs, unit trusts, funds holding collateralised debt obligations, property unit trusts and venture capital investments of the PAC with-profits funds where the Group has significant influence.
As allowed under IAS 28, these investments are accounted for on a fair value through profit or loss basis.
The aggregate fair value of associates accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, where there are published price quotations, is approximately 1.4 billion at 31 December 2015 2014: 1.2 billion.
The Groups share of the profits, net of related tax, and carrying amount of interest in joint ventures and associates, which are equity accounted as shown in the consolidated income statement comprises the following: Jointventures Associates 2015 m 2014 m 2015 m 2014 m Shareholder-backed business 171 162 14 12 PAC with-profits fund prior to offsetting effect in movement in unallocated surplus 53 129 Total 224 291 14 12 There is no other comprehensive income in the joint ventures and associates.

co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 283 Notes on the parent company financial statements 1 Nature of operations Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in Asia, the US and the UK.
In Asia, the Group has operations in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
In the UK, the Group operates through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited and M&G Investment Management Limited.
2 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the statement of financial position, statement of changes in equity and related notes, are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and endorsed by the EU, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has adopted FRS 101 for the first time.
In the transition to FRS 101, the Company has made no measurement and recognition adjustments.
An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101 has affected the presentation of the financial statements of the Company is provided in note 14.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A cash flow statement and related notes: Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Prudential Group: Disclosure in respect of capital management: The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: and An additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy to adopt FRS 101.
As the consolidated financial statements of the Group include the equivalent disclosure, the Company has also applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in respect of Group-settled share-based payments: and Disclosure required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
The accounting policies set out in note 3 below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS 101 statement of financial position at 1 January 2014 for the purposes of the transition to FRS 101.
3 Significant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less impairment.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are held to manage certain macroeconomic exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity or, for subordinated debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
From 2016, the Company will make all dividend payments as interim payments.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12, Income Taxes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups main pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
Upon adoption of FRS 101, the Company applies the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefit as revised in 2011 for the accounting of its interest in the PSPS surplus or deficit.
Further details are disclosed in note 9.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company is able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine their present value.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the net income interest on the net scheme assets liabilities at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit or loss account.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, experience variances or the return on scheme assets excluding amounts included in the net deferred benefit asset liability are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled plans with a few cash-settled plans.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equitysettled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

11 Retained profit of the Company Retained profit at 31 December 2015 amounted to 5,866 million 2014: 5,909 million.

The non-distributable reserves comprise 2,405 million relating to gains made by intermediate holding companies following the transfer at fair value of certain subsidiaries to other parts of the Group as part of internal restructuring exercises and 76 million of share-based payment reserves.
The amount of 2,405 million is not able to be regarded as part of the distributable reserves of the parent company because the gains relate to intra-group transactions.
Under English company law, Prudential may pay dividends only if sufficient distributable reserves of the Company are available for the purpose and if the amount of its net assets is greater than the aggregate of its called up share capital and non-distributable reserves such as the share premium account and the payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that aggregate.

We utilised the results of KPMG benchmarking of assumptions and actuarial market practice to inform our challenge of managements assumptions in both areas.
Other key procedures included assessing the Groups methodology for calculating the insurance liabilities and their analysis of the movements in insurance liabilities during the year, including consideration of whether the movements are in line with the assumptions adopted by the Group, our understanding of developments in the business and our expectation derived from market experience.
We considered the validity of managements liability adequacy testing which is a key test performed to check that the liabilities are adequate in the context of expected experience.
Our work on the liability adequacy test includes assessing the reasonableness of the projected cash flows and challenging the assumptions adopted in the context of company and industry experience data and specific product features.
We also performed test work to ensure the appropriateness of changes made to the reserving models during the year.
We considered whether the Groups disclosures in relation to the assumptions used in the calculation of insurance liabilities are compliant with the relevant accounting requirements, in particular the sensitivities of these assumptions to alternative scenarios and inputs.

By contrast, embedded value is a way of reporting the value of the life insurance business.
The European Embedded Value principles were published by the CFO Forum of major European insurers in May 2004 and subsequently supplemented by Additional Guidance issued in October 2005.
The impact of Solvency II is not reflected in these results in line with the guidance issued by the CFO Forum in October 2015 see note 15 for further details.
The principles provide consistent definitions, a framework for setting actuarial assumptions and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures.
Results prepared under the EEV principles capture the discounted value of future profits expected to arise from the current book of long-term business.
The results are prepared by projecting cash flows by product, using best estimate assumptions for all relevant factors.
Furthermore, in determining these expected profits, full allowance is made for the risks attached to their emergence and the associated cost of capital, taking into account recent experience in assessing likely future persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses.
Further details are explained in notes 13 and 14.

Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the net worth so that backing assets are included at fair value rather than cost so as to comply with the EEV Principles.
Free surplus for asset management operations and the UK general insurance commission is taken to be IFRS basis post-tax earnings and shareholders equity.

If the change in assumption shown in the sensitivities were to occur, then the effect shown above would be recorded within two components of the profit analysis for the following year.
These are for the effect of economic assumption changes and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In addition to the sensitivity effects shown above, the other components of the profit for the following year would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions, for example new business contribution and unwind of discount, together with the effect of other changes such as altered corporate bond spreads.
In addition, for changes in interest rates, the effect shown above for Jackson would also be recorded within the fair value movements on assets backing surplus and required capital which are taken directly to shareholders equity.

The shareholders interest in the Groups long-term business comprises: The present value of future shareholder cash flows from in-force covered business value of in-force business, less deductions for: The cost of locked-in required capital: and The time value of cost of options and guarantees: Locked-in required capital: and The shareholders net worth in excess of required capital free surplus.
The value of future new business is excluded from the embedded value.
Notwithstanding the basis of presentation of results as explained in note 13 b iii no smoothing of market or account balance values, unrealised gains or investment return is applied in determining the embedded value or profit.
Separately, the analysis of profit is delineated between operating profit based on longer-term investment returns and other constituent items as explained in note 13 b i.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information i Coveredbusiness The EEV results for the Group are prepared for covered business, as defined by the EEV Principles.
Covered business represents the Groups long-term insurance business, including the Groups investments in joint venture insurance operations, for which the value of new and in-force contracts is attributable to shareholders.
The post-tax EEV basis results for the Groups covered business are then combined with the post-tax IFRS basis results of the Groups other operations.
Under the EEV Principles, the results for covered business incorporate the projected margins of attaching internal asset management, as described in note 13 a vii.
The definition of long-term business operations is consistent with previous practice and comprises those contracts falling under the definition for regulatory purposes together with, for US operations, contracts that are in substance the same as guaranteed investment contracts GICs but do not fall within the technical definition.
Covered business comprises the Groups long-term business operations, with two exceptions: The closed Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF which is excluded from covered business.
SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the Prudential Assurance Company PAC long-term fund, established by a Court-approved Scheme of Arrangement in October 1997.
SAIF is closed to new business and the assets and liabilities of the fund are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
The presentational treatment of the Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
The partial recognition of the surplus for PSPS is recognised in Other operations.
A small amount of UK group pensions business is also not modelled for EEV reporting purposes.
ii  The embedded value results are prepared incorporating best-estimate assumptions about all relevant factors including levels of future investment returns, expenses, persistency, mortality and morbidity as described in note 14.
These assumptions are used to project future cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows is then calculated using a discount rate which reflects both the time value of money and the non-diversifiable risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.
New business In determining the EEV basis value of new business, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing annual and single premium business as set out for statutory basis reporting.
New business premiums reflect those premiums attaching to covered business, including premiums for contracts classified as investment products for IFRS basis reporting.
New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.
Internal vesting business is classified as new business where the contracts include an open market option.
The post-tax contribution from new business represents profits determined by applying operating assumptions as at the end of the year.
For UK immediate annuity business and single premium Universal Life products in Asia, primarily in Singapore, the new business contribution is determined by applying economic assumptions reflecting point-of-sale market conditions.
This is consistent with how the business is priced as crediting rates are linked to yields on specific assets and the yield is locked in when the assets are purchased at the point of sale of the policy.
For other business within the Group, end-of-year economic assumptions are used.
New business profitability is a key metric for the Groups management of the development of the business.
In addition, post-tax new business margins are shown by reference to annual premium equivalents APE and the present value of new business premiums PVNBP.
These margins are calculated as the percentage of the value of new business profit to APE and PVNBP.
APE is calculated as the aggregate of regular new business amounts and one-tenth of single new business amounts.
PVNBP is calculated as equalling single premiums plus the present value of expected premiums of new regular premium business, allowing for lapses and other assumptions made in determining the EEV new business contribution.
Valuation movements on investments With the exception of debt securities held by Jackson, investment gains and losses during the year to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included directly in the profit for the year and shareholders equity as they arise.
The results for any covered business conceptually reflect the aggregate of the IFRS results and the movements on the additional shareholders interest recognised on the EEV basis.
Thus the start point for the calculation of the EEV results for Jackson, as for other businesses, reflects the market value movements recognised on the IFRS basis.
However, in determining the movements on the additional shareholders interest, the basis for calculating the Jackson EEV result acknowledges that, for debt securities backing liabilities, the aggregate EEV results reflect the fact that the value of in-force business instead incorporates the discounted value of future spread earnings.
This value is not affected generally by short-term market movements on securities that, broadly speaking, are held for the longer term.
Fixed income securities backing the free surplus and required capital for Jackson are accounted for at fair value.
However, consistent with the treatment applied under IFRS for Jackson securities classified as available-for-sale, movements in unrealised appreciation depreciation on these securities are accounted for in equity rather than in the income statement, as shown in the movement in shareholders equity.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 319 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 13  iii Costofcapital A charge is deducted from the embedded value for the cost of capital supporting the Groups long-term business.
This capital is referred to as required capital.
The cost is the difference between the nominal value of the capital and the discounted value of the projected releases of this capital allowing for investment earnings post-tax on the capital.
The annual result is affected by the movement in this cost from year to year which comprises a charge against new business profit and generally a release in respect of the reduction in capital requirements for business in force as this runs off.
Where required capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets in the fund is already discounted to reflect its release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of required capital.
iv  Nature of financial options and guarantees in Prudentials long-term business Asia operations Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described below in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts principally written in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
There are also various non-participating long-term products with guarantees.
The principal guarantees are those for whole-of-life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions.
US operations Jackson The principal financial options and guarantees in Jackson are associated with the fixed annuity and variable annuity VA lines of business.
Fixed annuities provide that, at Jacksons discretion, it may reset the interest rate credited to policyholders accounts, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
The guaranteed minimum return varies from 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent for both years, depending on the particular product, jurisdiction where issued, and date of issue.
For 2015, 87 per cent 2014: 86 per cent of the account values on fixed annuities are for policies with guarantees of 3 per cent or less.
The average guarantee rate is 2.6 per cent 2014: 2.7 per cent.
Fixed annuities also present a risk that policyholders will exercise their option to surrender their contracts in periods of rapidly rising interest rates, possibly requiring Jackson to liquidate assets at an inopportune time.
Jackson issues VA contracts where it contractually guarantees to the contract holder either: a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals: b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return: or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the specified contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable at specified dates during the accumulation period Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB, as death benefits Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits GMDB or as income benefits Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits GMIB.
These guarantees generally protect the policyholders value in the event of poor equity market performance.
Jackson hedges the GMDB and GMWB guarantees through the use of equity options and futures contracts, and fully reinsures the GMIB guarantees.
Jackson also issues fixed index annuities that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return while providing a guaranteed minimum return.
The guaranteed minimum returns are of a similar nature to those described above for fixed annuities.
UK insurance operations For covered business the only significant financial options and guarantees in the UK insurance operations arise in the with-profits fund.
There are two types of bonuses annual and final.
Annual bonuses are declared once a year and, once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike annual bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
The PAC with-profits fund also held a provision on the Pillar I Peak 2 basis of 47 million at 31 December 2015 31 December 2014: 50 million to honour guarantees on a small number of guaranteed annuity option products.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuity options in the UK is through the non-covered business of SAIF.
A provision on the Pillar I Peak 2 basis of 412 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2015 31 December 2014: 549 million to honour the guarantees.
As described in note 13 a i, the assets and liabilities are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
Therefore the movement in the provision has no direct impact on shareholders.
Time value The value of financial options and guarantees comprises two parts.
One is given by a deterministic valuation on best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value.
The other part arises from the variability of economic outcomes in the future the time value.
Where appropriate, a full stochastic valuation has been undertaken to determine the time value of the financial options and guarantees.
The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations.
Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of long-term economic conditions.
Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with an allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
Details of the key characteristics of each model are given in notes 14 iv, v and vi.
320 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information In deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions have been modelled.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to investment allocation decisions, levels of reversionary and terminal bonuses and credited rates.
Bonus rates are projected from current levels and varied in accordance with assumed management actions applying in the emerging investment and fund solvency conditions.
In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options actually available to management.
For the PAC with-profits fund, the actions assumed are consistent with those set out in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management which explains how regular and final bonus rates within the discretionary framework are determined, subject to the general legislative requirements applicable.
v  In adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has based required capital on its internal targets subject to it being at least the local statutory minimum requirements.
For with-profits business written in a segregated life fund, as is the case in Asia and the UK, the capital available in the fund is sufficient to meet the required capital requirements.
For shareholder-backed business the following capital requirements apply: Asia operations: the level of required capital has been set to an amount at least equal to the higher of local statutory requirements and the internal target: US operations: the level of required capital has been set at 250 per cent of the risk-based capital required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC at the Company Action Level CAL : and UK insurance operations: the capital requirements are set to an amount at least equal to the higher of Solvency I Pillar I and Pillar II requirements for shareholder-backed business of UK insurance operations as a whole.
vi  The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the PAC with-profits fund has been based on the present level of 10 per cent.
The value attributed to the shareholders interest in the estate is derived by increasing final bonus rates and related shareholder transfers so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
In any scenarios where the total assets of the life fund are insufficient to meet policyholder claims in full, the excess cost is fully attributed to shareholders.
Similar principles apply, where appropriate, for other with-profits funds of the Groups Asia operations.
vii  The new business and in-force results from long-term business include the projected value of profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered insurance businesses.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the current year profits from the management of both internal and external funds.
EEV basis shareholders other income and expenditure is adjusted to deduct the unwind of the expected internal asset management profit margin for the year.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered insurance business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of management of the covered business assets.
viii  Overview Under the EEV Principles, discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows are set by reference to risk-free rates plus a risk margin.
The risk margin should reflect any non-diversifiable risk associated with the emergence of distributable earnings that is not allowed for elsewhere in the valuation.
Prudential has selected a granular approach to better reflect differences in market risk inherent in each product group.
The risk discount rate so derived does not reflect an overall Group market beta but instead reflects the expected volatility associated with the cash flows for each product category in the embedded value model.
Since financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology, discount rates under EEV are set excluding the effect of these product features.
The risk margin represents the aggregate of the allowance for market risk, additional allowance for credit risk where appropriate, and allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risk.
No allowance is required for non-market risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.
Market risk allowance The allowance for market risk represents the beta multiplied by an equity risk premium.
Except for UK shareholder-backed annuity business as explained below such an approach has been used for the Groups businesses.
The beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk.
The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product cash flows.
These are determined by considering how the profits from each product are affected by changes in expected returns on various asset classes.
By converting this into a relative rate of return, it is possible to derive a product-specific beta.
Product level betas reflect the most recent product mix to produce appropriate betas and risk discount rates for each major product grouping.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 321 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 13  Additional credit risk allowance The Groups methodology is to allow appropriately for credit risk.
The allowance for total credit risk is to cover: Expected long-term defaults: Credit risk premium to reflect the volatility in downgrade and default levels : and Short-term downgrades and defaults.
These allowances are initially reflected in determining best estimate returns and through the market risk allowance described above.
However, for those businesses largely backed by holdings of debt securities, these allowances in the projected returns and market risk allowances may not be sufficient and an additional allowance may be appropriate.
The practical application of the allowance for credit risk varies depending upon the type of business as described below: Asia operations For Asia operations, the allowance for credit risk incorporated in the projected rates of return and the market risk allowance are sufficient.
Accordingly no additional allowance for credit risk is required.
The projected rates of return for holdings of corporate bonds comprise the risk-free rate plus an assessment of long-term spread over the risk-free rate.
US operations Jackson For Jackson business, the allowance for long-term defaults is reflected in the risk margin reserve RMR charge which is deducted in determining the projected spread margin between the earned rate on the investments and the policyholder crediting rate.
The risk discount rate incorporates an additional allowance for credit risk premium and short-term downgrades and defaults as shown in note 14 ii.
In determining this allowance a number of factors have been considered.
These factors, in particular, include: How much of the credit spread on debt securities represents an increased credit risk not reflected in the RMR long-term default assumptions, and how much is liquidity premium which is the premium required by investors to compensate for the risk of longerterm investments which cannot be easily converted into cash, and converted at the fair market value.
In assessing this effect, consideration has been given to a number of approaches to estimating the liquidity premium by considering recent statistical data: and Policyholder benefits for Jackson fixed annuity business are not fixed.
It is possible in adverse economic scenarios to pass on a component of credit losses to policyholders subject to guarantee features through lower investment return rates credited to policyholders.
Consequently, it is only necessary to allow for the balance of the credit risk in the risk discount rate.
The level of the additional allowance is assessed at each reporting period to take account of prevailing credit conditions and as the business in force alters over time.
The additional allowance for variable annuity business has been set at one-fifth of the non-variable annuity business to reflect the proportion of the allocated holdings of general account debt securities.
The level of allowance differs from that for UK annuity business for investment portfolio differences and to take account of the management actions available in adverse economic scenarios to reduce crediting rates to policyholders, subject to guarantee features of the products.
UK operations 1 Shareholder-backed annuity business For Prudentials UK shareholder-backed annuity business, Prudential has used a market consistent embedded value MCEV approach to derive an implied risk discount rate which is then applied to the projected best estimate cash flows.
In the annuity MCEV calculations, as the assets are generally held to maturity to match long duration liabilities, the future cash flows are discounted using the swap yield curve plus an allowance for liquidity premium based on Prudentials assessment of the expected return on the assets backing the annuity liabilities after allowing for: Expected long-term defaults, derived as a percentage of historical default experience based on Moodys data for the period 1970 to 2009, and the definition of the credit rating assigned to each asset held is the second highest credit rating published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch: A credit risk premium, derived as the excess over the expected long-term defaults, of the 95th percentile of historical cumulative defaults based on Moodys data for the period 1970 to 2009, and subject to a minimum margin over expected long-term defaults of 50 per cent: An allowance for a 1-notch downgrade of the asset portfolio subject to credit risk: and An allowance for short-term downgrades and defaults.
For the purposes of presentation in the EEV results, the results on this basis are reconfigured.
Under this approach the projected earned rate of return on the debt securities held is determined after allowing for expected long-term defaults and, where necessary, an additional allowance for an element of short-term downgrades and defaults to bring the allowance in the earned rate up to best estimate levels.
The allowances for credit risk premium, 1-notch downgrade and the remaining element of short-term downgrade and default allowances are incorporated into the risk margin included in the discount rate, shown in note 14 iii.
322 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information 2 With-profits fund non-profit annuity business For UK non-profit annuity business including that attributable to the PAC with-profits fund, the basis for determining the aggregate allowance for credit risk is consistent with that applied for UK shareholder-backed annuity business as described above.
The allowance for credit risk for this business is taken into account in determining the projected cash flows to the with-profits fund, which are in turn discounted at the risk discount rate applicable to all of the projected cash flows of the fund.
3 With-profits fund holdings of debt securities The UK with-profits fund holds debt securities as part of its investment portfolio backing policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
The assumed earned rate for with-profits holdings of corporate bonds is defined as the risk-free rate plus an assessment of the long-term spread over gilts, net of expected long-term defaults.
This approach is similar to that applied for equities and properties for which the projected earned rate is defined as the risk-free rate plus a long-term risk premium.
Allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risks The majority of non-market and non-credit risks are considered to be diversifiable.
Finance theory cannot be used to determine the appropriate component of beta for non-diversifiable non-market risks since there is no observable risk premium associated with it that is akin to the equity risk premium.
Recognising this, a pragmatic approach has been applied.
A base level allowance of 50 basis points is applied to cover the non-diversifiable non-market risks associated with the Groups businesses.
For the Groups US business and UK business other than shareholder-backed annuity, no additional allowance is necessary.
For UK shareholder-backed annuity business a further allowance of 50 basis points is used to reflect the longevity risk which is of particular relevance.
For the Groups Asia operations in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, additional allowances are applied for emerging market risk ranging from 100 to 250 basis points.
ix  Foreign currency profits and losses have been translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at year end rates of exchange.
The principal exchange rates are shown in note A1 of the IFRS statements.
x Taxation In determining the post-tax profit for the year for covered business, the overall tax rate includes the impact of tax effects determined on a local regulatory basis.
Tax payments and receipts included in the projected cash flows to determine the value of in-force business are calculated using rates that have been announced and substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.
xi  The EEV results for covered business incorporate annuities established in the PAC non-profit sub-fund from vesting pension policies in SAIF which is not covered business.
The EEV results also incorporate the effect of the reinsurance arrangement of non-profit immediate pension annuity liabilities of SAIF to PRIL.
In addition, the free surplus and value of in-force business are calculated after taking account of the impact of contingent loan arrangements between Group companies movements in the contingent loan liability are reflected via the projected cash flows in the value of in-force, and the related funding is reflected in free surplus.
b  i  To the extent applicable, the presentation of the EEV post-tax profit for the year is consistent in the classification between operating and non-operating results with the basis that the Group applies for the analysis of IFRS basis results.
Operating results reflect underlying results including longer-term investment returns which are determined as described in note 13 b ii below and incorporate the following: New business contribution, as defined in note 13 a ii : Unwind of discount on the value of in-force business and other expected returns, as described in note 13 b iii : The impact of routine changes of estimates relating to non-economic assumptions, as described in note 13 b iv : and Non-economic experience variances, as described in note 13 b v. In order to show the UK long-term business result on a comparable basis, the presentation of 2014 results has been adjusted to show the results of the sold PruHealth and PruProtect businesses separately.
Non-operating results comprise the recurrent items of: Short-term fluctuations in investment returns: The mark to market value movements on core borrowings: and The effect of changes in economic assumptions.
In addition, non-operating profit includes: The effect on free surplus generated from the disposal of the Japan life business in 2015: The gain on sale of the PruHealth and PruProtect businesses in 2014: and The costs associated with the domestication of the Hong Kong branch which became effective on 1 January 2014.
Total profit attributable to shareholders and basic earnings per share include these items, together with actual investment returns.
The Group believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 323 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 13  ii  For the investment element of the assets covering the net worth of long-term insurance business, investment returns are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rate of return.
These expected returns are calculated by reference to the asset mix of the portfolio.
For the purpose of calculating the longer-term investment return to be included in the operating result of the PAC with-profits fund of UK operations, where assets backing the liabilities and unallocated surplus are subject to market volatility, asset values at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of short-term market movements as explained in note 13 b iii below.
For the purpose of determining the long-term returns for debt securities of US operations for fixed annuity and other general account business, a risk margin charge is included which reflects the expected long-term rate of default based on the credit quality of the portfolio.
For Jackson, interest-related realised gains and losses are amortised to the operating results over the maturity period of the sold bonds and for equity-related investments, a long-term rate of return is assumed, which reflects the aggregation of end-of-year risk-free rates and equity risk premium.
For US variable annuity separate account business, operating profit includes the unwind of discount on the opening value of in-force adjusted to reflect end-of-year projected rates of return with the excess or deficit of the actual return recognised within non-operating profit, together with the related hedging activity.
For UK annuity business, rebalancing of the asset portfolio backing the liabilities to policyholders may, from time to time, take place to align it more closely with the internal benchmark of credit quality that management applies.
Such rebalancing will result in a change in the projected yield on the asset portfolio and the allowance for default risk.
The net effect of these changes is included in the result for the year.
iii  The unwind of discount and other expected returns is determined by reference to: The value of in-force business at the beginning of the year adjusted for the effect of current period economic and operating assumption changes : and Required capital and surplus assets.
In applying this general approach, the unwind of discount included in operating profit for the with-profits business of UK insurance operations is determined by reference to the opening value of in-force, as adjusted for the effects of short-term investment volatility due to market movements ie smoothed.
In the summary statement of financial position and for total profit reporting, asset values and investment returns are not smoothed.
At 31 December 2015 the shareholders interest in the smoothed surplus assets used for this purpose only, were 58 million lower 31 December 2014: 194 million lower than the surplus assets carried in the statement of financial position.
iv  Operating profit includes the effect of changes to non-economic assumptions on the value of in-force at the end of the year.
For presentational purposes, the effect of change is delineated to show the effect on the opening value of in-force as operating assumption changes, with the experience variance subsequently being determined by reference to the end-of-year assumptions see note 13 b v below.
v  Operating profit includes the effect of experience variances on non-economic assumptions, such as persistency, mortality and morbidity, expenses and other factors, which are calculated with reference to the end-of-year assumptions.
vi  Movements in the value of in-force business at the beginning of the year caused by changes in economic assumptions, net of the related change in the time value of cost of options and guarantees, are recorded in non-operating results.
14 Assumptions  The EEV basis results for the Groups operations have been determined using economic assumptions where the long-term expected rates of return on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to year end rates of return on government bonds.
Expected returns on equity and property asset classes and corporate bonds are derived by adding a risk premium, based on the Groups long-term view, to the risk-free rate.
The total profit that emerges over the lifetime of an individual contract as calculated using the embedded value basis is the same as that calculated under the IFRS basis.
Since the embedded value basis reflects discounted future cash flows, under this methodology the profit emergence is advanced, thus more closely aligning the timing of the recognition of profit with the efforts and risks of current management actions, particularly with regard to business sold during the year.

 Details are given below of the key characteristics of the models used to determine the time value of the financial options and guarantees as referred to in note 13 a iv.
iv Asiaoperations The stochastic cost of guarantees is primarily of significance for the Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan operations.
The principal asset classes are government and corporate bonds.
The asset return models are similar to the models as described for UK insurance operations below.
The volatility of equity returns ranges from 18 per cent to 35 per cent, and the volatility of government bond yields ranges from 0.9 per cent to 2.3 per cent for both years.
v USoperations Jackson Interest rates and equity returns are projected using a log-normal generator reflecting historical market data.
Corporate bond returns are based on treasury yields plus a spread that reflects current market conditions.
The volatility of equity returns ranges from 18 per cent to 27 per cent, and the standard deviation of interest rates ranges from 2.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent for both years.
vi  Interest rates are projected using a stochastic interest rate model calibrated to the current market yields.
Equity returns are assumed to follow a log-normal distribution.
The corporate bond return is calculated based on a risk-free bond return plus a mean-reverting spread.
Property returns are also modelled on a risk-free bond return plus a risk premium with a stochastic process reflecting total property returns.
The standard deviation of equities and property ranges from 15 per cent to 20 per cent for both years.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Operatingassumptions  Best estimate assumptions are used for the cash flow projections, where best estimate is defined as the mean of the distribution of future possible outcomes.
The assumptions are reviewed actively and changes are made when evidence exists that material changes in future experience are reasonably certain.
Assumptions required in the calculation of the value of options and guarantees, for example relating to volatilities and correlations, or dynamic algorithms linking liabilities to assets, have been set equal to the best estimates and, wherever material and practical, reflect any dynamic relationships between the assumptions and the stochastic variables.
Demographic assumptions Persistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on an analysis of recent experience, but also reflect expected future experience.
Where relevant, when calculating the time value of financial options and guarantees, policyholder withdrawal rates vary in line with the emerging investment conditions according to managements expectations.
Expense assumptions Expense levels, including those of service companies that support the Groups long-term business operations, are based on internal expense analysis investigations and are appropriately allocated to acquisition of new business and renewal of in-force business.
Exceptional expenses are identified and reported separately.
For mature business, it is Prudentials policy not to take credit for future cost reduction programmes until the savings have been delivered.
For businesses which are currently sub-scale China, Malaysia Takaful and Taiwan, and India where the business model is being adapted as the industry continues to adjust to regulatory changes, expense overruns are reported where these are expected to be short-lived.
For Asia operations, the expenses comprise costs borne directly and recharged costs from the Asia regional head office, that are attributable to covered business.
The assumed future expenses for these operations also include projections of these future recharges.
Development expenses are charged as incurred.
Corporate expenditure, which is included in other income and expenditure, comprises: Expenditure for Group head office, to the extent not allocated to the PAC with-profits funds, together with Solvency II implementation and restructuring costs, which are charged to the EEV basis results as incurred: and Expenditure of the Asia regional head office that is not allocated to the covered business or asset management operations which is charged as incurred.
These costs are primarily for corporate related activities and are included within corporate expenditure.
Taxrates The assumed long-term effective tax rates for operations reflect the incidence of taxable profits and losses in the projected cash flows as explained in note 13 a x.
The local standard corporate tax rates applicable for the most significant operations are as follows:  % Asia operations: Hong Kong 16.5 Indonesia 25.0 Malaysia 2015: 25.0: from 2016: 24.0 Singapore 17.0 US operations 35.0 UK operations 2015: 20.0: from 2017: 19.0: from 2020: 18.0   iv b.
15  The Solvency II framework is effective from 1 January 2016.
For our operations in Asia and the US, there is no impact on the EEV results since Solvency II does not act as the local constraint on the ability to distribute profits to the Group.
The EEV basis results and profile of free surplus generation for these businesses will continue to be driven by local regulatory and target capital requirements.
For the UK insurance operations Solvency II will impact the EEV results as it changes the local regulatory valuation of net worth and capital requirements, affecting the components of the EEV and the expected profile of free surplus generation.
In line with guidance provided by the CFO Forum in October 2015, the impact of Solvency II on the UK EEV has not been included in the results presented in this section.
An early estimate on the likely impact of Solvency II on the EEV net worth and value of in-force business is provided in section II i of the additional unaudited information.
