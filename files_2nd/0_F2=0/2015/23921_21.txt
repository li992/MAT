Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of these Financial Statements, are set out below: a Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments, and in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice GAAP and the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies and dated January 2009 and the Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors believe this is appropriate as the Companys net assets consist almost entirely of liquid securities which are quoted on recognised stock exchanges.
b Investments As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of dividends, interest or increases in fair value, investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss and are initially recognised at fair value.
The Company manages and evaluates the performance of these investments on a fair value basis in accordance with its investment strategy, and information about the investments is provided internally on this basis to the Board.
Fair value for quoted investments is deemed to be bid market prices, or last traded price, depending on the convention of the stock exchange on which they are quoted.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors using primary valuation techniques such as discounted multiple of revenue, in accordance with IPEVCA guidelines.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss, and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Income Statement as gains or losses on investments designated at fair value through profit or loss.
All purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on the trade date basis.
The Companys policy is to expense transaction costs on acquisition through the capital column of the Income Statement.
The total of such expenses, showing the total amounts included in disposals and acquisitions are disclosed in note 9 on page 53, as recommended by the SORP.
c Investment Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised on the ex-dividend date.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis.
Special dividends: In deciding whether a dividend should be regarded as a capital or revenue receipt, the Company reviews all relevant information as to the reasons for and sources of the dividend on a case by case basis.
The limited liability partnership LLP profit share is recognised in the financial statements when the entitlement to the income is established.
d Dividend Payments Dividends paid by the Company on its shares are recognised in the financial statements in the period in which they are paid and are shown in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds.

Accounting Policies continued e Expenditure and Finance Charges All the expense and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: 1 expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment are treated as part of the cost or proceeds of that investment as explained in 1 b above : 2 expenses are taken to the capital reserve via the capital column of the Income Statement, where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In line with the Boards expected long term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income from the Companys portfolio, 67% of the portfolio management fee, AIFM fee and finance costs are taken to the capital reserve: f Taxation The payment of taxation is deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Full provision for deferred taxation is made under the liability method, without discounting, on all timing differences that have arisen, but not reversed by the balance sheet date, unless such provision is not permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 19.
Any tax relief obtained in respect of management and investment management fees, finance costs and other capital expenses charged or allocated to the capital column of the Income Statement is reflected in the Capital Reserve and a corresponding amount is charged against the revenue column of the Income Statement.
The tax relief is the amount by which corporation tax payable is reduced as a result of these capital expenses.
g Foreign currency Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
h Nature and purpose of reserves Special reserve The special reserve arose following Court approval in July 2002 to transfer 13.16 million from the share premium account.
This reserve is distributable and has historically been used to fund any share buy-backs by the Company.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve arose when ordinary shares were redeemed by the Company and subsequently cancelled, at which point the amount equal to the par value of the ordinary share capital was transferred from the ordinary share capital to the capital redemption reserve.
Capital reserve This reserve reflects any: gains or losses on the disposal of investments: exchange differences of a capital nature: the increases and decreases in the fair value of investments which have been recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement: and expenses which are capital in nature as disclosed in note I e. following amendments to the Companys Articles of Association in 2015, this reserve can be used to distribute realised capital profits by way of dividend.
Revenue reserve This reserve reflects all income and expenditure which are recognised in the revenue column of the income statement and is also distributable.

Risk Management As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on pages 16 and 17.
In pursuit of its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the revenue profits available for distribution.
The Companys financial instruments comprise mainly of equity investments, cash balances, borrowings and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The principal risks inherent in managing the Companys financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks and the Directors approach to the management of them are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 21 and 22.
Market risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Market price risk As an investment company, performance is dependent on the performance of the underlying companies and securities in which it invests.
The market price of investee companies shares is subject to their performance, supply and demand for the shares and investor sentiment regarding the Company or the industry sector in which it operates.
Consequently market price risk is one of the most significant risks to which the Company is exposed.
At 30 September 2015, the fair value of the Companys assets exposed to market price risk was 692,951,000 2014: 514,798,000 see page 8.
If the fair value of the Companys investments at the Balance Sheet date increased or decreased by 20%, while all other variables remained constant, the capital return and net assets attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 September 2015 would have increased or decreased by 138,590,000 or 114.6p per share 2014: 102,960,000 or 105.6p per share.
No derivatives or hedging instruments are utilised to manage market price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate movement may affect: the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings the level of income receivable from variable interest securities and cash deposits the fair value of investments of fixed rate securities The Companys main exposure to interest rate risk during the year ended 30 September 2015 was through its three year 50,000,000 secured multicurrency committed revolving credit facility with Scotiabank Europe PLC maturing in October 2016.
Borrowings varied throughout the year as part of the Boards endorsed policy.
Borrowings at the year-end amounted to 29,000,000 2014: 23,100,000 at an interest rate of 1.88% LIBOR plus 1.30%.
If the above level of borrowing was maintained for a year a 1% increase decrease in LIBOR would decrease increase the revenue return by 96,000, 2014: 76,000 decrease increase the capital return by 194,000 2014: 155,000, and decrease increase the net assets by 290,000 2014: 231,000.
The weighted average interest rate, during the year, on borrowings under the above mentioned revolving credit facility was 1.87% 2014: 1.84%.

Risk Management continued At the year-end, the Companys financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk were as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 within more than within more than one year one year one year one year 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating rates: Assets Cash at bank and in hand 8,440 2,029 Liabilities Creditors: amount falling due after one year borrowings under the loan facility 29,000 23,100 Exposure to fixed rates: Assets Investments designated at fair value through profit or loss# 492 392 Liabilities #Celtic 6% cumulative convertible preference shares and Frostrow Capital LLP AIFM Investment.
Currency risk The Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company.
At 30 September 2015, the Companys investments, with the exception of six, were priced in sterling.
The six exceptions, Thomson Reuters, listed in Canada, Heineken, listed in the Netherlands, Remy Cointreau listed in France, and Dr. Pepper Snapple, The Kraft Heinz Company and Mondelez International, all listed in the United States, represent 18.5% of the portfolio see page 8.
The AIFM and the Portfolio Manager monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a continuous basis and regularly report to the Board.
The Company does not hedge against foreign currency movements, but the Portfolio Manager takes account of the risk when making investment decisions.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between its receipt and the time that the income is included in the Financial Statements.
The following table details the sensitivity of the Companys capital or revenue return after taxation for the year to a % increase and decrease in sterling against foreign currency, after applying the average rate of volatility of the currency over the year.
The average rate of volatility for each currency over the year: U. S. dollars 1.8% increase and decrease 2014: 1.6%, Canadian dollars 4.0% 2014: 2.8% and Euros 3.6% 2014: 2.0%.

Risk Management continued Credit Risk Credit risk is the Companys exposure to financial loss from the failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisition or disposals of investments which could result in the Company suffering a financial loss.
Credit risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out only with brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Portfolio Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transactions entered into by the Company has delivered its obligation before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed.
Any failing trades in the market are closely monitored by both the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager.
Cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Board as reputable and of high credit quality.
Bank of New York Mellon has a credit rating of Aa1 Moodys and AAS&P.
Scotiabank Europe PLC, the provider of the Companys loan facility, has a first fixed and floating charge over the assets of the Company as security against any funds drawn down by the Company under the loan facility.
The Company is in the second year of its three-year secured fixed term multicurrency revolving credit facility of 50 million.
As at 30 September 2015, the exposure to credit risk was 11,133,000 2014: 4,440,000, comprising: 2015 2014 000 000 Fixed assets: Non-equity investments preference shares 72 72 Current assets: Other receivables amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable 2,621 2,339 Cash at bank and in hand 8,440 2,029 Total exposure to credit risk 11,133 4,440 Liquidity risk of investments Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable, and are significantly in excess of its financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value or at a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data for the asset or liability.
The table overleaf sets out fair value measurements of financial instruments as at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern: and to achieve capital and income growth and to provide shareholders with a total return in excess of that of the FTSE All-Share Index through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Board, with the assistance of the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital.
These reviews include: the level of gearing, set at limits in normal market conditions, between 5% and 25% of net assets, which takes account of the Companys position and the views of the Board, the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager on the market: and the extent to which revenue reserves should be retained or utilised.
The Companys objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
There were no breaches by the Company, during the year, of the financial covenants put in place by Scotiabank Europe PLC in respect of the committed revolving credit facility provided to the Company.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them at all times.
