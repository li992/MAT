Similarly, Wealth Management cash Going concern is normally not made available for the Groups general corporate Having considered the liquidity of the Group, the cash and other purposes.
Excluding cash held within these businesses, the resources of the Group and the Groups cash requirements, the Groups cash holdings decreased by 142.8 million to Directors consider the Group to be a going concern, as outlined 718.0million.
Cash generated was primarily used to fund on page 67. dividend payments, purchase financial assets for investment capital and seed capital purposes and to acquire own shares for employee share scheme hedging.
Although the cash position reduced, the Groups general corporate cash position remains very strong and was further strengthened by entering into a 200.0 million loan facility in 2015 which provides additional access to short-term liquidity.
This is in line with the Groups general capital position of maintaining a prudent position to ensure long-term stability.
The liquidity position in Wealth Management is strong and all entities maintain liquidity ratios that are substantially in excess of those required by local regulators.
Cash in Wealth Management decreased by 411.2 million in the year, principally as a result of a change in the maturity profile of its investment portfolio, which resulted in an increase in financial assets.
Operating cash flow see note 23 In 2015, net cash inflows from operating activities were 47.9million, a decrease of 1,274.0 million from 2014.
This variance arose as the 2014 operating cash flows included a one off cash inflow as a result of the integration of the acquired Cazenove Capital business into the Schroders operating model, which resulted in client cash being recognised in our Consolidated statement of financial position.
The remaining movement was mainly due to a change in the maturity profile of the Wealth Management investment portfolio, which resulted in a switch from cash equivalents to financial assets in accordance with accounting rules.
Life Company cash flows relate to movements in balances that relate to unit-linked liabilities.
Operating cash outflows were 2.6million higher than 2014 at 93.2 million.
