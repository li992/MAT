Home Retail Group 78 Annual Report 2015 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2015 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Home Retail Group plc the Company, which is the ultimate parent company of Home Retail Group the Group, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group is a home and general merchandise retailer.
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 29 April 2015.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 28 February 2015 prior financial year 52 weeks to 1 March 2014.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee Interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the European Union.
They also comply with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historic cost basis modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, share-based payments and post-employment benefits.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in note 3.
Unless otherwise stated, these policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the ultimate parent company Home Retail Group plc, entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and the Groups share of its interests in associates.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group for the purposes of the Groups consolidation.
Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity whose operating and financing policies are controlled by the Group.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control was transferred to the Group.
Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated from the date that the Group no longer has control.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Home Retail Group companies have been eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations Under the requirements of IFRS 3, all business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of business acquisitions is the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer.
The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria at their fair values at that date.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
Intangible assets are recognised if they meet the definition of an intangible asset contained in IAS 38 and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Changes in accounting standards There are no new standards, amendments to existing standards or interpretations which are effective for the first time during the year ended 28 February 2015 that have a material impact on the Group.
At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective, including IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group has not early-adopted any of these new standards or amendments to existing standards.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15.
There are no other new standards, amendments to existing standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
The resulting accounting estimates, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of the financial statements, will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods where appropriate.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Taxes The Group is subject to taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 79 Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the results for the year and the respective income tax and deferred tax provisions in the year in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable.
Post-employment benefits The present value of the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
The main assumption used in determining the defined benefit obligations and net pension costs is the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions may impact the amounts disclosed in the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the defined benefit obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity consistent with the estimated average term of the related pension liability.
Other key assumptions for defined benefit obligations and pension costs are based in part on market conditions at the relevant year-ends and additional information is disclosed in note 25.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs at the level of each business segment.
The Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered any impairment loss on an annual basis, based on the recoverable amount, being the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
The value-in-use calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates as disclosed in note 14.
Impairment of assets Assets are subject to impairment reviews whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
If such an indicator exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
In the case of store assets, a CGU may represent a single store or a group of stores.
Assets or CGUs are written down to their recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows from the asset at an appropriate discount rate for the risks associated with that asset.
This includes the expected future cash flows based on managements assumptions and estimates of the future performance of the asset and an appropriate discount rate.
Differences between expectations and the actual cash flows will result in differences in the level of impairment required.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if there has been a significant change in the underlying assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount, however not to an amount higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortisation or depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised in prior years.
Impairment of trade receivables A trade receivable is impaired when there is objective evidence that events since the receivable was established have affected the expected cash flows from the receivable.
The Groups impairment provision against trade receivables is established on a portfolio basis, taking into account the level of arrears, past loss experience and defaults based on portfolio trends.
The future credit quality of the trade receivable portfolio is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual credit losses to differ materially from the reported impairment provision against trade receivables.
These uncertainties include the economic environment, notably the unemployment level, payment behaviour and bankruptcy trends.
Provisions Provisions have been estimated for property, insurance, restructuring, customer redress in respect of Payment Protection Insurance PPI and other liabilities.
These provisions represent the best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date, the actual liability being dependent on future events such as trading conditions at a particular store, including expected costs or income associated with store closures, the incidence of insurance claims against the Group or the anticipated costs of related customer contact and redress.
Expectations will be revised each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted for in the period in which the revision is made.
Inventory provisions Inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, which requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of goods to customers in the future.
Cost includes the impact of discounts received from suppliers which is directly linked to the purchase of stock.
Net realisable value takes into account slow moving, obsolete and defective inventory.
Any difference between the expected and the actual sales price achieved will be accounted for in the period in which the sale is made.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, discounts and expected returns.
Revenue is recognised as follows: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue on goods to be delivered is recognised when the customer receives delivery of the goods.
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods being sold at a discount to the standard retail price.
Commissions receivable on the sale of services for which the Group acts as agent are included within revenue.
Interest income Interest income on customer store card accounts is recognised as revenue using the effective interest method.
Commercial income Commercial income is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date.
The Group only recognises commercial income where there is documented evidence of an agreement with a supplier.
The types of commercial income recognised by the Group are: Type of commercial income Description Accounting policy Marketing and advertising income Examples include contributions to Income which is directly linked to the cost of producing the catalogue the cost of the catalogue, funding is recognised once agreed with the supplier and when the catalogue is for other advertising and shortmade available to the Group, which is the same point at which the term product promotions.
Other marketing and advertising income is recognised once agreed with a supplier and over the period as set out in the specific supplier agreement.
Volume-based rebates Income earned by achieving Income is recognised through the year based on forecasts for expected specific volume targets agreed sales or purchase volumes, informed by current performance, trends and with the supplier for specific the terms of the supplier agreement.
Income is invoiced throughout the products.
year in accordance with the specific supplier terms.
The majority of those arrangements run for one calendar year.
Commercial income related to inventory held on the balance sheet is deferred within inventory as a cost price reduction.
Commercial income earned but not collected at the balance sheet date is recognised within trade and other receivables.
There are no material amounts of collected and deferred commercial income within trade and other payables at the 28 February 2015 balance sheet date.
There are certain other types of funding which is collected from suppliers, for example discounts received on settlement of creditor balances and cost recoveries from suppliers for product quality issues which have been excluded from commercial income disclosure principally because they are not judgemental.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial information is presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash flow hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary items are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 81 Group companies The results and financial position of overseas Home Retail Group entities are translated into sterling as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to equity.
Tax charges and credits attributable to those exchange differences are taken directly to equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors and Group Executive Board.
Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets of a subsidiary or associate acquired at the date of acquisition.
Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised and is tested at least annually for impairment.
An impairment charge is recognised where the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
Value-in-use calculations are performed using cash flow projections discounted at a rate taking account of the specific risks inherent within the Groups retail businesses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where necessary on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable and their fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria are satisfied.
These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate resources to complete the development and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit.
The cost of other intangible assets with finite useful economic lives is amortised over that period.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
If impaired, they are written down to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Brands Acquired brands have a finite useful life and are initially recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently held at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated to spread the cost of the brands over their estimated useful lives of 10 years on a straight-line basis.
This amortisation method reflects the pattern in which the assets future economic benefits are expected to be consumed.
Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are held at cost, being the purchase price and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into use less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
An impairment charge is recognised where the carrying value of the asset or CGU to which the asset belongs exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
Value-in-use calculations are performed using cash flow projections discounted at a rate taking account of the specific risks inherent within the Groups businesses.
Home Retail Group 82 Annual Report 2015 Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2015 3.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis as follows: freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years: leasehold premises are depreciated over the period of the lease: plant and equipment are depreciated over 2 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset: land is not depreciated: and assets under the course of construction are not depreciated.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale Where the carrying value of a non-current asset is expected to be principally recovered through its sale the asset is classified as held for sale if it also meets the following: The asset is available for sale in its current condition The sale is highly probable The sale is expected to occur within one year Once classified as held for sale, the asset is held at the lower of its carrying value and the fair value less cost to sell and is no longer depreciated.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the balance sheet, with the cost of unrecoverable trade receivables recognised in the income statement immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost bases in use within the Group are general retail goods valued on a standard cost or weighted average basis which approximates to actual cost.
Commercial income received in respect of specific inventory is treated as a reduction in the cost of this inventory.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Costs of inventory include the transfer from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges relating to their purchase.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost.
Corporation tax Corporation tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Corporation tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, in which case it is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, respectively.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts.
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 83 Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Provisions are made for property provisions, including onerous lease contracts for stores that have closed or where a decision to close has been announced, and for those stores where the projected future trading income is insufficient to cover the lower of exit cost or cost of continuing to trade the store.
Provisions for other costs and income on store closures are recognised where such an outflow or inflow is probable.
Provisions are made for potential customer redress in respect of PPI to cover claims made by customers, including estimated redress payments, and specific costs incurred in remediation.
Provisions are also made for legal claims, the estimated cost of insurance claims incurred by the Group but not settled at the balance sheet date, restructuring costs and other liabilities.
Insurance Statutory classes of risk, such as employer liability and certain motor liability, are insured by the Groups captive insurer, Home Retail Group Guernsey LP.
The Group self-insures other risks and the liabilities associated with these risks are held elsewhere within the Group.
The Group accounts for all insurance costs as part of operating costs in these financial statements.
Insurance premiums in respect of insurance placed with third parties are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the life of the lease.
Post-employment benefits The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past service costs.
The defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected-unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
For defined contribution pension plans the Group and employees pay contributions into an independently administered fund.
The cost of providing these benefits, recognised in the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Catalogue costs Costs incurred during the production of the Groups catalogues are deferred on the balance sheet net of any associated advertising revenue and marketing support until the catalogue is made available to the Group, at which point the net deferred cost is charged to the income statement.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year-end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid.
Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.
Home Retail Group 84 Annual Report 2015 Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2015 3.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Other financial assets Other financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Other financial assets are measured at fair value or, where fair value cannot be reliably measured, at cost less impairment.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The movements in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income until the financial asset is derecognised or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates its derivatives as cash flow hedges.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are shown in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Cash flow hedges The cash flow hedges are intended to hedge the foreign currency exposures of future purchases of inventory.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion would be recognised immediately in the income statement.
The hedged cash flow is expected to occur up to 14 months into the future and will be transferred to the consolidated income statement via inventory carrying value as applicable.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current offer price.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares granted is recognised as an expense after taking into account the best estimate of the number of awards expected to vest.
The Group revisits the vesting estimate at each balance sheet date.
Non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimate.
Expenses are incurred over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo models, or closing market price that is most appropriate to the award.
Market-based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revisited for actual performance.
Non-GAAP financial information Home Retail Group has identified certain measures that it believes will assist the understanding of the performance of the business.
The measures are not defined under IFRS and they may not be directly comparable with other companies adjusted measures.
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but Home Retail Group has included them as it considers them to be important comparables and key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
The following are the key non-GAAP measures identified by Home Retail Group: Exceptional items Items which are both non-recurring and material in either size or nature are presented as exceptional items within their relevant income statement line.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of underlying performance of the Group.
Examples of items which may be recorded as exceptional items are restructuring costs and the profits and or losses on the disposal of businesses.
Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 85 Benchmark measures The Group uses the following terms as measures which are not formally recognised under IFRS: Benchmark operating profit is defined as operating profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, post-employment benefit scheme administration costs, store impairment and onerous lease charges or releases and costs or income associated with store closures and exceptional items.
Benchmark profit before tax benchmark PBT is defined as profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, post-employment benefit scheme administration costs, store impairment and onerous lease charges or releases and costs or income associated with store closures, exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements, financing impact on post-employment benefit obligations, the discount unwind on non-benchmark items and taxation.
Basic benchmark earnings per share benchmark EPS is defined as benchmark PBT less taxation attributable to benchmark PBT, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue excluding shares held in Home Retail Groups share trusts net of vested but unexercised share awards.
These measures are considered useful in that they provide investors with an alternative means to evaluate the underlying performance of the Groups operations.
Total net debt The Group uses the term total net debt which is considered useful in that it highlights the Groups aggregate net indebtedness to banks and other financial institutions together with debt-like liabilities, notably operating leases.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk factors There are a number of financial risks and uncertainties which could impact the performance of the Group, being market risk foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group operates a structured risk management process which identifies, evaluates and prioritises risks and uncertainties.
Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties that could impact the Groups performance, and the Groups mitigating activities, are set out in the principal risks and uncertainties section of the review of the business on pages 24 and 25.
The Groups treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to foreign exchange, interest rate and other financial risks, and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Policies and procedures are subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors.
Market risk foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with external banks.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts.
The key objective of the Groups foreign exchange transaction exposure management is to minimise potential volatility in profits which could arise as a result of exchange rate fluctuations whilst maintaining an appropriate relative position versus the Groups retail peers.
To achieve the above objectives, the Group will initially seek to hedge up to 90% of any foreign exchange transaction risks expected to arise as a result of uncertain, but probable, foreign currency cash flows up to 14 months forward.
This subsequently increases to 100% as cash flows become certain.
Each subsidiary designates contracts as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, as appropriate.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The cash flow hedges are intended to hedge the foreign currency exposure of future purchases of inventory.
The hedged cash flows are expected to occur up to 14 months into the future and will be transferred to the consolidated income statement or inventory carrying value as applicable.
The Group has foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not hedged.
If on 28 February 2015, the last day of the financial year, sterling had been 5 cents, or approximately 3% 2014: approximately 3%, weaker stronger against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 0.3m lower higher 2014: 1.2m lower higher mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses gains arising on retranslation of US dollar denominated balances in subsidiary companies with a sterling functional currency.
Equity would have been 10.3m higher lower 2014: 11.1m higher lower, arising mainly from the revaluation of US dollar forward currency contracts.
Home Retail Group 86 Annual Report 2015 Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2015 4.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED If on 28 February 2015, the last day of the financial year, sterling had been 5 cents, or approximately 4% 2014: approximately 4%, weaker stronger against the euro, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 0.4m lower higher 2014: 0.1m lower higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses gains on retranslation of sterling denominated cash balances in subsidiary companies with a euro functional currency.

Market risk cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Whilst the Groups Financial Services business has gross instalment receivable balances Financial Services loan book on fixed interest rates and floating rates, the Groups income and operating cash flows are still considered to be substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group currently holds a net cash position and has undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from the variance in market rate when deposits are made.
This risk is managed by combining overnight deposits with term deposits.
The principal objective of the Groups interest rate risk management is to manage the trade-off between obtaining the most beneficial effective rates of interest whilst minimising the impact of interest rate volatility on profits before tax.
The Group had no borrowings at any point during the year.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk within its Financial Services loan book.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of financial services products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Customers are credit scored using data from an external credit agency and a credit risk provision is held which is based on historic default experience note 20.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash, via major debit and credit cards or via in-house or third-party operated financial products.
The Groups exposure to credit risk with regard to treasury transactions is managed by dealing only with major banks and financial institutions.
Dealing activity is closely controlled and counterparty positions are monitored on a regular basis.
Foreign exchange counterparty limits are set for each organisation on a scale based on credit rating and maturity period.
The Groups cash management policy, which was updated and approved by the Board of Directors during the year, requires: for a term deposit of up to 50m for up to three months a bank must have a minimum long-term rating of Aor better: for an additional three month term deposit of up to 50m a bank must have a minimum long-term rating of A, or a minimum long-term rating of A if the UK Government holds a minimum shareholding of 25%: for a term deposit of up to 50m for a period of up to 12 months, a bank must have a minimum long-term rating of A, or a minimum long-term rating of A if the UK Government holds a minimum shareholding of 25%: for instant access on demand accounts of up to 50m a bank must have a minimum short-term rating of B: for instant access on demand accounts of up to 100m a bank must have a minimum short-term rating of A-1: and for a deposit of up to 100m in a money market fund, the fund must have a long-term rating of AAA.
Each deposit made by the Group during the year was compliant with the policy that was effective at the date the deposit was made.
Where a term deposit has been made and the counterparty ratings have subsequently reduced, each relevant position has been reviewed and any decision to maintain a position until the normal maturity date has been approved by the Board of Directors.
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings as follows: Cash and term deposits Cash and Bank and institution Bank and institution short-term long-term rating at long-term rating at cash deposits transaction date 28 February 2015 m A A 207.8 AA- 50.0 BB BB 25.4 BB BB 26.1 309.3 Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 87 Cash and Bank and institution Bank and institution short-term long-term rating at long-term rating at cash deposits transaction date 1 March 2014 m AAA AAA 6.8 A A 250.0 AA- 50.0 BB BB 24.2 331.0 Marked to market forward foreign exchange contracts 2015 2014 Bank and institution rating at year-end m m A 19.0 27.2 A- 6.2 8.4 BB 1.9 0.1 27.1 35.5 Liquidity risk Home Retail Group manages its cash and committed borrowing facilities to maintain liquidity and funding flexibility.
Liquidity is achieved through arranging funding ahead of requirements and maintaining sufficient undrawn committed facilities to meet short-term needs, and facilities are in place for this purpose.
At 28 February 2015, the Group had an undrawn committed borrowing facility available of 165m.
This facility, which was unsecured, included a covenant related to adjusted benchmark earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rent and also included a covenant related to net balance sheet debt.
This facility was cancelled on 26 March 2015 prior to its contractual maturity date of 27 March 2016 as a result of agreeing a new unsecured, committed borrowing facility of 250m.
This new facility also includes the covenants noted above.
The Group has not drawn down on its borrowing facilities and has been in compliance with the requirements of the covenants throughout the year.
Trade and other payables of 828.6m 2014: 639.9m all have contractual maturity dates of less than three months at the balance sheet date.
When a forward foreign exchange contract matures, this requires an outflow of the currency being sold and an inflow of the currency being bought.
The table below analyses the Groups outflow and inflow from derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal and efficient capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group finances its operations through a combination of cash, property leases and borrowing facilities where necessary.
The Group has significant commitments through its obligations to pay rents under property leases.
The Group, in common with the credit rating agencies, treats its lease liabilities as debt when evaluating financial risk and investment returns.
In addition, the Groups Financial Services business holds a net loan book balance of 580m 2014: 524m as at 28 February 2015.
The Groups net debt varies throughout the year due to trading seasonality, and the position as at 28 February 2015 is set out in the analysis of net cash debt on page 77.

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
These instruments are included in level 1 and comprise investments in quoted managed indexed funds.
As at 28 February 2015, these instruments, which are classified as other financial assets, had a carrying value of 10.5m 2014: 9.8m.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
As at 28 February 2015, the fair value of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes was a net asset of 27.1m 2014: 35.5m net liability.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
The available-for-sale financial asset within the level 3 hierarchy is measured at cost less impairment.
The impairment has been calculated to write down the asset to its recoverable value based on the actual financial position of the Groups associate.
The fair value measurement is therefore not sensitive to changes in inputs.
There has been no movements in level 3 financial assets during the period and there have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.

The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to Argos and Homebase is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to Habitat, which is immaterial, is based on some of the same key assumptions.
The recoverable amount of each of Argos and Homebase has been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on the financial plans approved by management looking forward five years.
Benchmark operating profits for the current year, of 129.2m for Argos 2014: 112.3m and 19.8m for Homebase 2014: 18.9m, have been adjusted into the plan period.
The five-year projections for each business have been prepared with regard to the following key assumptions: sales growth, based on externally prepared projections which have been adjusted into the plan period for, among other things, the effect of sales initiatives, the announced store closure plan in Homebase and changes to the competitive landscape in which each business operates: gross margins, based on recent experience, which have been adjusted for factors such as the impact of changes to product costs, estimated future shipping rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as margin improvement initiatives, including sourcing benefits and changes to product mix or range: and costs, based upon the existing cost base, expected levels of cost inflation and anticipated cost saving initiatives.
The cash flows for each business are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate beyond the five-year plan period, and are discounted to calculate the value-in-use.
The key assumptions used are: a long-term growth rate of 2.0% 2014: 2.0%, which has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-year plan period.
The growth rate is consistent with external forecasts and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the UK: and a post-tax discount rate of 8.5% 2014: 8.5%, which equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 10.3% 2014: 10.6%, has been estimated taking account of the specific risks inherent within the Groups retail businesses and has been applied to the cash flow projections.
Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 97 The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
The values attributed to these key assumptions over the five-year plan period are: 2015 2014 Argos Homebase Argos Homebase Compound annual increase in sales 3.4% 1.3% 2.7% 4.9% Compound annual decrease in gross margin rate 0.4% 0.5% 0.2% 0.5% Compound annual increase decrease in operating costs 1.3% 0.4% 0.2% 2.7% Long-term growth rate beyond five years 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Post-tax discount rate 8.5% 8.5% 8.5% 8.5% At 28 February 2015, the excess in the estimated recoverable amount of each business segment, calculated on a value-in-use basis, over its carrying value was 936m 2014: 1,298m for Argos and 391m 2014: 494m for Homebase.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of the above assumptions used for assessing the recoverable amount of each business segment, with other variables held constant, and as a result, management has concluded that reasonably possible changes in the assumptions could cause the carrying value of each business segment to exceed its recoverable amount.
The amounts by which the above assumptions would need to change to cause the carrying value of each business segment to exceed its recoverable amount are: 2015 Argos Homebase Including Including mitigating mitigating In isolation actions In isolation actions Decrease in the compound annual growth rate in sales 1.3% 1.8% 1.0% 1.5% Decrease in the compound annual growth rate in gross margin rate 1.2% 1.5% 1.0% 1.3% Increase in the compound annual growth rate in operating costs 1.5% 1.5% 1.1% 1.1% 2014 Argos Homebase Including Including mitigating mitigating In isolation actions In isolation actions Decrease in the compound annual growth rate in sales 1.9% 2.7% 1.1% 1.7% Decrease in the compound annual growth rate in gross margin rate 1.8% 2.2% 1.0% 1.3% Increase in the compound annual growth rate in operating costs 2.4% 2.4% 1.2% 1.2% No sensitivities to the discount rate and growth assumptions have been disclosed as management believes that no reasonably possible change in these assumptions would generate a different outcome to the impairment tests as performed.
The mitigating actions included in the above analysis reflect the estimated impact of management actions expected to be taken in the event of these sensitivities arising.

Long-term receivables have been discounted where the time value of money is material.
All receivables due after more than one year are due within five years from the balance sheet date.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a broad customer base.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Included in other receivables is 22.9m 2014: 21.7m of commercial income balances which have been earned during FY15 and principally relate to contractually agreed volume-based rebates which are expected to be collected in the first few months of FY16.
As at 28 February 2015, trade receivables of 62.1m 2014: 66.4m were individually determined to be impaired.
The impaired receivables mainly relate to store card holder balances on customer accounts on which indications of possible default have been identified.
Provision for impairment of trade receivables is also made on a portfolio basis against trade receivables which are not individually determined to be impaired.
Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 1 March 2014 73.1 75.7 Charge for the year 16.2 23.6 Utilised 20.9 26.2 At 28 February 2015 68.4 73.1 As at 28 February 2015, trade receivables of 8.0m 2014: 7.6m were past due but not impaired.

The Group has provided letters of credit totalling 12.5m 2014: 12.5m to AIG Europe Limited as part of their re-insurance agreement.
These letters are secured by cash deposits.
NON-CURRENT ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE 2015 2014 m m Freehold property 18.3 On 24 November 2014, the Group announced that Homebase had exchanged contracts for the unconditional sale of its freehold store located in Battersea, London.
The sale is due to complete in FY16 and the property has been sold for 57.0m, of which a deposit of 30.0m has been received in FY15, with the balance of 27.0m due on completion.
As a consequence, this property has been presented as held for sale at the year-end.
The unconditional sale agreement triggered a chargeable tax gain of 6.7m in the current financial year, however this has been fully offset against previously unrecognised capital losses and therefore had no impact on the tax charge for the year.

Long-term payables have been discounted where the time value of money is material.
During the first half of FY15 management commenced a review of certain higher risk areas within the Argos balance sheet.
Subsequent to this and following the well-publicised accounting issues in the retail sector and the recently published FRCs December 2014 press release in respect of complex supplier arrangements, the review was broadened to encompass a review of the Groups balance sheet.
This review resulted in a net credit of 11.5m being recognised as a one-off non-benchmark item in the current year.
This amount comprises a credit of 11.3m in respect of changes to a small number of accounting estimates together with a net credit of 0.2m in respect of a small number of historic accounting errors that relate principally to trade and other payables.
These adjustments all relate to Argos.

In respect of onerous leases, provision is made for onerous lease contracts on stores that have closed, or where a decision to close has been announced, and for those stores where the projected future trading income is insufficient to cover the lower of exit cost or cost of continuing to trade the store.
Where the cost of continuing to trade the store is lower, the provision is based on the present value of expected future cash flows relating to rents, rates and other property costs to the end of the lease terms net of expected trading or sublet income.
The majority of this provision is expected to be utilised over the period to 2020.
Provision is made for the estimated costs of insurance claims incurred by the Group which have not been settled at the balance sheet date, including the costs of claims that have arisen but have not yet been reported to the Group.
The estimated cost of claims includes operational costs to be incurred in administering future claims.
The majority of this provision is expected to be utilised over the period to 2019.
The restructuring provision relates to a number of actions undertaken by the Group during the current and prior years.
Actions currently being undertaken by the Group include: the ongoing project to transform Argos into a digital retail leader: the Homebase Productivity Plan which includes head office restructuring costs and costs associated with the closure of a distribution centre in FY16: and Group restructuring costs principally relating to the transitioning to Fujitsu of Information Systems infrastructure and services that support the Groups operations.
Financial Services offers PPI to its customers.
Redress payments have begun to be made, resulting in the partial utilisation of this provision in FY15.
The customer redress provision comprises the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers in respect of past sales of PPI policies, including the related operational costs of administering these claims.
The eventual cost is dependent upon response rates, uphold rates, redress costs, claim-handling costs and those costs associated with claims that are subsequently referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
The provision represents managements best estimate of future costs and will remain under review.
Had management used different assumptions, a larger or smaller provision charge would have resulted.
The most significant assumption is the expected response rate to the customer contact exercise which has been estimated at 35%.
If the response rate is one percentage point higher lower than estimated then the provision at 28 February 2015 would have increased decreased by approximately 1m.
This provision is expected to be utilised within one year.
Home Retail Group 104 Annual Report 2015 Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2015 25.
POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS During the year, the Group operated both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension scheme that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which both the Group and employees pay contributions into an independently administered fund.
The defined benefit scheme is closed to future accrual.
The cost of providing the benefits under the defined contribution schemes, recognised in the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Pension arrangements for UK employees were provided principally through a defined benefit scheme the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme, until it was closed to future accrual during FY13, and a defined contribution scheme the Home Retail Group Personal Pension Plan, which continues to be operated.
In other countries, benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided accordingly.
Defined benefit schemes The Home Retail Group Pension Scheme The scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid and is financed accordingly with assets being held in independently administered funds.
A full actuarial valuation of this scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2012 by independent, qualified actuaries, Towers Watson, using the projected unit method and resulted in a deficit of 158m.
The next full actuarial valuation of the scheme will be carried out as at 31 March 2015.
The existing deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustee provides for payments of 22.0m per annum paid in quarterly instalments until 31 December 2019.
Unfunded defined benefit scheme The Group has in place arrangements which secure unfunded pension benefit arrangements for certain directors and senior managers by granting charges to an independent Trustee over independently managed portfolios of marketable securities owned by the Group.
The amount of assets charged in this way is adjusted annually to keep the ratio of assets charged to the discounted value of the accrued benefits secured in this way as close as possible to the corresponding ratio in the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme.
The total value of the assets charged in this way at 28 February 2015 was 10.5m 2014: 9.8m.
The Groups unfunded defined benefit arrangement closed to future accrual with effect from 30 April 2013.
Further details of the pension arrangements for directors appear in the audited part of the directors remuneration report.
IAS 19 valuations The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial funding valuations and have been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at the year-end.
As required by IAS 19, the value of the defined benefit obligations at the year-end has been measured using the projected unit method.
The movements during the year in the net deficit recognised in the balance sheet were as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 2 March 2014 76.6 85.1 Total net charge recognised in the consolidated income statement 4.9 5.2 Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 55.6 23.8 Contributions paid by the Group deficit recovery 22.0 22.0 other 0.7 15.5 At 28 February 2015 114.4 76.6 During the year, the Group has paid contributions totalling 22.7m 2014: 25.5m to the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme including 22.0m 2014: 22.0m as part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the scheme Trustee following the completion of the 31 March 2012 actuarial valuation.
The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid by the Group during the next financial year is 22.0m, all of which relates to the deficit recovery plan.
The defined benefit obligations consist of a combination of both insured liabilities whereby the Trustee has entered an insurance contract with a regulated insurer, to take over the financial responsibility for meeting the cost of the pension promise made by the Group to those members covered by the premium and non-insured liabilities where the Group has responsibility for meeting the costs of the pension promise.
The risks associated with defined benefit funding for the insured liabilities have therefore been passed to the insurance company although the Group retains ultimate responsibility for the insured liabilities if the insurance company should fail.
Recognising this transfer of risk, the sensitivities described below relate to the non-insured defined benefit obligations only.
Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 105 The amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are determined as follows: 2015 2014 m m Fair value of scheme assets 989.3 891.8 Present value of insured funded obligations 315.4 293.6 Present value of non-insured funded liabilities 776.2 664.2 Deficit in the funded scheme 102.3 66.0 Present value of unfunded pension arrangements 12.1 10.6 Post-employment benefits recognised in the balance sheet 114.4 76.6 The weighted average duration to payment of the schemes expected non-insured cash flows is 27 years 2014: 27 years.

The principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2015 2014 % % Rate of inflation 3.0 3.3 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.9 3.2 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.9 3.2 Discount rate 3.5 4.4 Life expectancy: at age 65 for a male currently aged 65 22.4 years 22.3 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 65 24.8 years 24.7 years at age 65 for a male currently aged 50 24.0 years 23.9 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 50 26.6 years 26.4 years The discount rate is based on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds of equivalent currency and term to the defined benefit obligations.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to changes in the material assumptions is detailed below.
Changes in the insured defined obligations are matched by changes in the fair value of the insurance contract and therefore the sensitivities below relate to the non-insured defined benefit obligations only.
The impact of changing material assumptions is as follows: 2015 Indicative 2014 effect on Indicative effect non-insured on noninsured Increase defined defined decrease in benefit benefit assumptions obligations obligations m m Rate of inflation 0.5% - 103 - 86 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 0.5% - 47 - 39 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 0.5% - 53 - 44 Discount rate 0.5% - 96 - 79 Life expectancy 1 year - 22 - 18 Home Retail Group 106 Annual Report 2015 Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2015 25.
POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED Following closure of the scheme to future accrual during the year ended 2 March 2013, the present value of the defined benefit obligations is no longer impacted by increases in salaries.
The calculations in this section have been carried out using the same method and data as the Groups pensions and accounting figures with each assumption adjusted as shown above.
Each assumption has been varied individually and a combination of changes in assumptions could produce a different result.
The assets of the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme are summarised as follows: 2015 2014 Fair value Fair value Percentage Fair value Fair value Percentage of quoted of unquoted of scheme of quoted of unquoted of scheme assets assets assets assets assets assets m m % m m % Insurance policy 315.4 32 293.6 33 Equities 260.8 26 233.3 26 1 Fund of hedge funds 99.7 10 95.7 11 2 Diversified growth fund 139.8 14 94.0 10 Property funds 49.4 58.2 11 41.7 38.7 9 Corporate bonds 46.1 5 Index linked government bonds 6.2 1 4.9 1 Cash and cash equivalents 8.6 1 19.3 2 Other 51.2 5 24.5 3 Fair value of scheme assets 464.8 524.5 100 439.3 452.5 100 1 T he fund of hedge funds holds a portfolio of other hedge funds and is designed to achieve greater diversification of assets whilst maximising return and minimising risk to the scheme.
There are many different types of hedge fund, however they typically aim to produce absolute returns rather than relative returns, they use short as well as long-term investments and are typically traded more actively than traditional assets.
2 A d iversified growth fund DGF invests in a broad range of asset classes and is designed to produce less volatile returns than equities, which, if achieved, should help pension schemes to better maintain their funding level in volatile markets.
DGFs generally aim to achieve positive return or a real return ahead of inflation, have a wide exposure to a range of asset classes and are a low governance solution to the problem of diversifying a schemes assets.
The DGF, Standard Life Global Absolute Return Strategies, aims to provide positive investment returns in all market conditions over the medium and long term and invests mainly in derivatives, fixed income assets and equities.
Investment strategy Investment risk is managed by diversifying the assets across asset classes whose return patterns are not highly correlated.
The assets include an insurance contract which matches approximately one-third of the schemes pension benefits and therefore helps to significantly reduce the Groups defined benefit pension risks.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit liabilities are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Opening defined benefit liabilities 968.4 918.6 Finance expense 42.2 42.6 Remeasurements due to: Changes in financial assumptions 134.5 42.4 Experience on benefit liabilities 20.6 3.0 113.9 39.4 Benefits paid 20.8 32.2 Closing defined benefit liabilities 1,103.7 968.4 Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 107 Changes in the market value of the scheme assets are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Opening fair value of scheme assets 891.8 833.5 Finance income 39.2 39.3 Remeasurement of the assets recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 58.3 15.6 Post-employment benefit scheme administration costs 1.9 1.9 Contributions paid by the Group deficit recovery 22.0 22.0 other 0.7 15.5 Benefits paid 20.8 32.2 Closing fair value of scheme assets 989.3 891.8 The actual return on scheme assets was a gain of 97.5m 2014: 54.9m.
Risks The Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to its defined benefit scheme, the most significant of which are detailed below: Investment strategy Changes in asset values are not matched by changes in the non-insured schemes defined benefit obligations.
For example, if equity values fall with no changes in corporate bond yields, the net deficit on the scheme would increase.
Investment returns Future investment returns are lower than anticipated and so additional contributions are required from the Group to pay all the non-insured benefits promised.
Improvements in life Scheme members live longer and so benefits are payable for longer than anticipated.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS CONTINUED Summary of share option and share award arrangements During the year ended 28 February 2015, Home Retail Group plc had a number of share option and share award arrangements for its employees, all of which are equity-settled.
Details of these arrangements are as follows: Share options The Home Retail Group plc Save-As-You-Earn SAYE plan permits the grant to employees of options over the Companys shares linked to a building society SAYE contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of between 5 and 250 per month.
Options are normally capable of being exercised at the end of the three or five-year period at an exercise price calculated at a 10% or 20% discount dependent upon the date of grant to market price over the three dealing days preceding invitation to participants.
Options must be exercised within six months of the end of the three or five-year SAYE contract.
The Home Retail Group approved option plan.
Options are granted at an exercise price equal to the market price of the shares over the ten dealing days preceding grant.
For those options with performance conditions, the percentage of the options exercisable by participants is determined either by ranking TSR relative to a comparator group or by reference to performance against other specific targets, such as EPS growth, or cumulative adjusted cash flow.
The TSR target is considered a market-based performance condition under IFRS 2, and the values of options with this performance condition have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations measured over the three-year period preceding valuation.
The other targets are non market-based performance conditions, and the options with these performance conditions have been valued by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
The 1998 approved and non-approved executive share option schemes.
Under these schemes, the exercise price of granted options was equal to the market price of the shares over the three dealing days preceding grant.
The options became exercisable three years from the grant date, subject to the Groups EPS compound annual growth exceeding compound annual retail price inflation by 4% per annum over a continuous three-year period and the employee completing three years service.
The EPS growth target is not a market-based performance condition as defined by IFRS 2.
The options have a maximum term of 10 years from grant.
No new options have been granted under these schemes since 2006 and all outstanding awards have vested.
Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years after the date of grant for nil consideration.
For all awards under this plan, vesting is conditional on participants continued service.
For those awards with performance conditions, the percentage of the award distributed to participants is determined either by ranking TSR relative to a comparator group or by reference to performance against other specific targets, such as EPS growth, or cumulative adjusted cash flow.
The TSR target is considered a market-based performance condition under IFRS 2, and the awards with this performance condition have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations measured over the three-year period preceding valuation.
The other targets are non market-based performance conditions, and the awards with these performance conditions have been valued by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
The plan was amended in 2010 to add an HM Revenue & Customs approved option to the share awards at no additional cost.
The approved option is over the same number of shares as awarded under the normal PSP award, up to a maximum share value of 30,000.
The value of the award delivered under the approved share option is deducted from the PSP award, such that the two awards together give participants the same gross value as the normal PSP award only.
The share incentive plan was a one-off free share grant to all employees at the time of the demerger.
The shares were acquired by a trust on behalf of participants and were normally forfeited if a participants employment with the Group ceased within three years of the grant date.
All awards under this plan vested after this initial three-year period in November 2009, at which point participants were able to withdraw their shares, and since November 2011 shares can be withdrawn free of tax.
The shares continue to be held by the trust until they are either withdrawn by participants or the awards lapse.
Information relating to share option valuation techniques The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year over the Companys shares under the Groups option plans, determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was 0.31 2014: 0.27 per option.
The significant inputs into the option pricing model were as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 28 February 1 March Weighted average: 2015 2014 Share price on grant date 1.89 1.55 Exercise price 1.71 1.26 Expected volatility 45.3% 47.1% Expected dividend yield 1.9% 2.2% Risk free interest rate 1.5% 1.1% Expected option life to exercise 3.3 years 3.4 years Financial additional Home Retail Group StrateGic report Governance StatementS information Annual Report 2015 111 Expected volatility is a measure of expected fluctuations in the share price over the expected life of an option.
The measure of volatility used by the Group in its pricing model during the year ended 28 February 2015 has been set after considering the historical volatility of the Groups share price returns and the average of the volatilities of share price returns for other similar companies.

The PSPs market-based performance condition is included in the fair value measurement on grant date and is not revised for actual performance.
All of the share awards are equity-settled.
Under the share awards, the participants have an entitlement to either dividend equivalents or dividend distributions from issue date until point of vesting.
The observed market share price on the day of valuation is considered inclusive of future dividend distributions.
There were 7,125,927 ordinary share awards 2014: 16,033,999 granted during the year with a weighted average fair value of 1.69 2014: 1.29.
