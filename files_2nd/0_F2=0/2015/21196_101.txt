In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the statement of financial position will be affected.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
58 Derivative financial instruments and hedging This note gives details of the various financial instruments we use to mitigate risk.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with our overall risk management strategy.
The objectives include managing exposure to market, foreign currency and or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.
In the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments.
The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction.
They do not reflect current market values of the open positions.
The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held or issued by the Group.
The fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. master agreements or their equivalent.
Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure.
In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties.
Refer to note 59 for further information on collateral and net credit risk of derivative instruments.
a Instruments qualifying for hedge accounting The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of its instruments qualifying for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
