A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2015 128 Notice of Annual General Meeting Continued By order of the Board Registered Office A. G. BARR p. l. c. Westfield House 4 Mollins Road Julie A. Barr Cumbernauld Company Secretary G68 9HD 23 April 2015 Registered in Scotland SC005653 Shareholders should also read the notes to this Notice of Annual General Meeting which are set out on pages 130 to 134 of this report.
Those notes provide further information about shareholders entitlement to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting or appoint another person to do so on their behalf.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2015 129 Explanatory Notes The following notes provide an explanation of the resolutions to be considered at the one hundred and eleventh annual general meeting the AGM of A. G. BARR p. l. c. the Company.
Resolutions 1 to 14 inclusive will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolutions 15 and 16 will be proposed as special resolutions.
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 Receive and approve the reports and accounts Shareholders are being asked to receive and approve the audited accounts of the group and the Company as audited by KPMG LLP for the year ended 25 January 2015 together with the associated reports of the directors and auditor.
Resolution 2 Directors remuneration This Resolution invites shareholders to approve the annual statement by the chairman of the remuneration committee and the directors remuneration report other than the part containing the directors remuneration policy which was approved last year and which it is expected will not be voted on until the 2017 AGM for the year ended 25 January 2015.
Resolution 2 is an advisory vote and will not affect the way in which the Companys pay policy has been implemented.
Each year, shareholders will be given an advisory vote on the implementation of the directors remuneration policy in relation to the payments and share awards made to directors during the year under review.
Resolution 3 Final dividend Shareholders are being asked to approve a final dividend of 9.01 pence per ordinary share of 4 1 6 pence for the year ended 25 January 2015.
If shareholders approve the recommended final dividend, it will be paid on 5 June 2015 to all shareholders on the Companys register of members on 8 May 2015.
Resolutions 4 to 12 inclusive Re-election and election of directors The Companys articles of association require that all newly appointed directors retire at the first annual general meeting following their appointment.
Consequently, Stuart Lorimer and David Ritchie will retire and offer themselves for election.
The board of directors of the Company the Board complies with the provisions of the U. K. Corporate Governance Code whereby all directors are subject to annual re-election.
Accordingly, all other directors of the Company are retiring and offering themselves for re-election.
Biographical details of the directors are set out on page 39 of this report.
The Board has confirmed that, following formal performance evaluation, all of the directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
The Board therefore unanimously recommends the proposed re-election or election in the case of Stuart Lorimer and David Ritchie of the directors.
Resolution 13 re-appointment of auditor The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are presented to shareholders and KPMG LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office.
Accordingly, shareholders are being asked to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditor of the Company to hold office until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company and to authorise the audit committee of the Board to fix their remuneration.
Resolution 14 Authority to allot shares The directors may not allot shares in the Company unless authorised to do so by shareholders in general meeting.
Sub-paragraph a of Resolution 14, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot shares having an aggregate nominal value of up to 1,621,788.50, representing approximately one third of the Companys issued share capital as at 22 April 2015 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report.
The directors have no present intention to exercise this authority.
In line with guidance issued by the Investment Management Association, sub-paragraph b of Resolution 14, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot additional shares in connection with a rights issue having an aggregate nominal value of up to 1,621,788.50, representing approximately one third of the Companys issued share capital as at 22 April 2015 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report.
The directors have no present intention to exercise the authority sought under sub-paragraph b of Resolution 14.
However, if such authority is obtained, it will give the Company greater flexibility to allot additional shares for the purpose of a pre-emptive rights issue.
This authority will be used when the directors consider it to be in the best interests of shareholders.
The authorities sought under Resolution 14 will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2016 being the latest date by which the Company must hold its annual general meeting in 2016 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2016.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2015 130 Explanatory Notes Continued Resolution 15 Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights If the directors wish to allot new shares for cash, the Companies Act 2006 states that the shares must be offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
For legal, regulatory and practical reasons, it might not be possible or desirable for shares allotted by means of a pre-emptive offer to be offered to certain shareholders, particularly those resident overseas.
Furthermore, it might, in some circumstances, be in the Companys interests for the directors to be able to allot some shares for cash without having to offer them first to existing shareholders.
To enable this to be done, shareholders statutory pre-emption rights must be disapplied.
Accordingly, Resolution 15, if passed, will empower the directors to allot a limited number of new equity securities without shareholders statutory pre-emption rights applying to such allotment.
The authority conferred by Resolution 15 would also cover the sale of treasury shares for cash.
Sub-paragraph a of Resolution 15 would confer authority on the directors to make any arrangements which may be necessary to deal with any legal, regulatory or practical problems arising on a rights issue, an open offer or any other pre-emptive offer in favour of ordinary shareholders, for example, by excluding certain overseas shareholders from such issue or offer.
Sub-paragraph b of Resolution 15 would disapply shareholders statutory pre-emption rights by empowering the directors to allot equity securities for cash on a non pre-emptive basis but only new equity securities having a maximum aggregate nominal value of 243,268, representing approximately 5% of the Companys issued share capital as at 22 April 2015 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report.
The authority sought under Resolution 15 will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2016 being the latest date by which the Company must hold an annual general meeting in 2016 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2016.
Resolution 16 Purchase of own shares The Companies Act 2006 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by shareholders in general meeting.
Resolution 16, if passed, would give the Company the authority to purchase any of its own issued ordinary shares at a price of not less than an amount equal to the nominal value of an ordinary share and not more than the higher of: i 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of the Companys ordinary shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five dealing days before any purchase is made: and ii the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange plc.
The authority will enable the purchase of up to a maximum of 11,676,877 ordinary shares, representing 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM, and will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2016 being the latest date by which the Company must hold an annual general meeting in 2016 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2016.
The directors will only exercise this buy back authority after careful consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall position of the Company.
Purchases would be financed out of distributable profits and shares purchased would either be cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly or held as treasury shares.
The Company operates two share option schemes under which awards may be satisfied by the allotment or transfer of ordinary shares to a scheme participant.
However, in practice, the Company has always satisfied awards to participants by the transfer of ordinary shares from the trustee of each of the schemes.
As at 1 April 2015 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report, options had been granted over 1,944,951 ordinary shares the Option Shares representing approximately 1.67% of the Companys issued share capital at that date.
If the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares as described in Resolution 16 were exercised in full, the Option Shares would have represented approximately 1.85% of the Companys issued share capital as at 1 April 2015.
As at 1 April 2015, the Company did not hold any treasury shares.
