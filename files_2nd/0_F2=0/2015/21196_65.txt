Please refer to note 22 Fair value methodology for further information on the fair value measurement and valuation techniques of investment property.
The fair value of investment properties leased to third parties under operating leases at 31 December 2015 was 11,149 million 2014: 8,828 million.
Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 53 b i.
22 Fair value methodology This note explains the methodology for valuing our assets and liabilities measured at fair value, and for fair value disclosures.
It also provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.
a Basis for determining fair value hierarchy All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, the investments are classified as follows: Where the broker price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, we classify the investment as Level 2.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i. e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are investment properties, certain private equity investments and private placements.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 183 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 183 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Fair value methodology continued The majority of the Groups assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on quoted market information or observable market data.
16.1% of assets and 4.2% of liabilities measured at fair value are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value.
Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2. b Changes to valuation techniques There were no changes in the valuation techniques during the year compared to those described in the 2014 annual consolidated financial statements, other than those noted below.
c Comparison of the carrying amount and fair values of financial instruments Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
These amounts may differ where the asset or liability is carried on a measurement basis other than fair value, e. g. amortised cost.

e Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For financial instruments that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels of the fair value hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of the reporting period.
Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 For the year ended 31 December 2015, changes in the level of market activity for certain investments funds have resulted in transfers of financial assets from Level 1 to Level 2 of 0.1 billion and transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of approximately 20 million.
Transfer to from Level 3 Transfers out of Level 3 of 0.6 billion relate principally to debt securities held by our businesses in the UK and France which were transferred to Level 2 as observable inputs became available.
Transfers of assets into Level 3 of 4.3 billion included: 2.9 billion of Primary Healthcare, Private Finance Initiative PFI and infrastructure loans.
During the year, these loans were valued using a Portfolio Credit Risk Model in place of the previous discounted cash flow model.
As the liquidity premium input in this model has been deemed to be non-market observable and significant, the loans have been classified as Level 3 and transferred from Level 2.
0.9 billion of debt securities held in the UK and 0.3 billion held in France were transferred from Level 2 due to the unavailability of significant observable market data or sufficiently significant differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation models.
The remaining 0.2 billion relate to assets transferred into Level 3 from Level 1 and Level 2 as observable prices are no available longer available.
Transfers of liabilities into and out of Level 3 62 million and 13 million respectively relate to non-participating investment contract liabilities where the underlying assets have been transferred due to a change in the observability of the inputs.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 185 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 185 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Fair value methodology continued f Valuation approach for fair value assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 Please see note 22 a for a description of typical Level 2 inputs.
Debt securities, in line with market practice, are generally valued using an independent pricing service.
These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis.
Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the thirdparty broker quotes.
Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced from brokers.
Over the counter derivatives are valued using broker quotes or models such as option pricing models, simulation models or a combination of models.
The inputs for these models include a range of factors which are deemed to be observable, including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.
Unit Trusts and other investment funds included under the Other investments category are valued using net assets values which are not subject to a significant adjustment for restrictions on redemption or for limited trading activity.

186 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 186 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 IFRS Financial statements 22 Fair value methodology continued The principal assets classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are described below.
i Investment property Investment property amounting to 11.3 billion 2014: 8.9 billion is valued in the UK at least annually by external chartered surveyors in accordance with guidance issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and using estimates during the intervening period.
Outside the UK, valuations are produced by external qualified professional appraisers in the countries concerned.
Investment properties are valued on an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, lease expiry, or break option taking into consideration lease incentives and assuming no further growth in the estimated rental value of the property.
The uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties.
These inputs are deemed unobservable.
ii Loans Commercial mortgage loans, Primary Healthcare, Infrastructure and PFI loans held by our UK Life business amounting to 10.8 billion 2014: 10.4 billion, were valued using a Portfolio Credit Risk Model PCRM.
This model calculates a Credit Risk Adjusted Value CRAV for each loan.
The risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using a yield curve, taking into account the term dependent gilt yield curve, and global assumptions for the liquidity premium.
Loans valued using this model have been classified as Level 3 as the liquidity premium is deemed to be non-market observable.
The liquidity premium used in the discount rate ranges between 110 bps to 280 bps.
Equity release and securitised mortgage loans held by our UK Life business amounting to 6.7 billion 2014: 5.9 billion comprise: - 4.3 billion 2014: 3.6 billion of equity release mortgages held by our UK Life annuity business valued using an internal model.
Inputs to the model include property growth rates, mortality and morbidity assumptions, cost of capital and liquidity premium which are not deemed to be market observable.
The assumed property growth is approximately 2% per annum.
- 2.4 billion 2014: 2.3 billion of securitised and equity release mortgages are valued using a discounted cash flow model.
The inputs include liquidity risk and property risk premium which are deemed unobservable.
The liquidity premium used ranges between 158 bps to 185 bps.
Collateralised non-recourse loans of 0.6 billion 2014: 0.5 billion have been valued using internally developed models incorporating a significant number of modelling assumptions including the probability of counterparty default and the expected loss in the event of counterparty default.
iii Debt securities Privately placed notes held by our UK Life business of 3.3 billion 2014: 1.8 billion have been valued using broker quotes or a discounted cash flow model using discount factors based on swap curves of similar maturity, plus internally derived spreads for credit risk.
As these spreads have been deemed to be unobservable these notes have been classified as Level 3.
Structured bond-type and non-standard debt products held by our business in France amounting to 5.8 billion 2014: 7.4 billion and bonds held by our UK business of 2.2 billion 2014: 1.0 billion have no active market.
These debt securities are valued either using counterparty or broker quotes and validated against internal or third-party models.
These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either i the third-party models included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment, or ii differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.
Collateralised loan obligations of 0.4 billion 2014: 0.4 billion have been valued using internally developed discounted cash flow models incorporating a significant number of modelling assumptions and unobservable market data including assumptions regarding correlation among the underlying loans, a probability of default and liquidity premium.
Corporate debt securities held by our French business of 1.5 billion 2014: 0.3 billion and debt securities of 0.9 billion held by our UK and Asia businesses 2014: nil which are not traded in an active market have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations.
These prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions.
iv Equity securities Equity securities which primarily comprise private equity holdings of 0.8 billion 2014: 0.1 billion held in the UK are valued by a number of third party specialists.
These are valued using a range of techniques, including earnings multiples, forecast cash flows and price earnings ratios which are deemed to be unobservable.
v Other investments The following Other investments are valued based on external valuation reports received from fund managers: - Private equity investment funds amounting to 1.4 billion 2014: 1.0 billion : - Other investment funds including property funds amounting to 1.0 billion 2014: 0.5 billion : - External hedge funds held principally by businesses in the UK and France amounting to 0.5 billion 2014: 1.2 billion : and - Discretionary managed funds held in Asia amounting to 1.2 billion 2014: nil : Where these valuations are at a date other than balance sheet date, as in the case of some private equity funds, we make adjustments for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions and the fund managers carried interest.
Remaining Level 3 investments amount to 0.7 billion 2014: 1.1 billion within debt securities, equity securities and other investments held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.
Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 187 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 187 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Fair value methodology continued Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 investments to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives.
Valuations for Level 3 investments are sourced from independent third parties when available and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes.
Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis: For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.
For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input.
Sensitivities are determined by flexing inputs of internal models to a reasonable alternative, including the yield, NAV multiple or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation.
For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the securitys contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 49.0 billion of the Groups Level 3 assets.
For these Level 3 assets, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value by 2.0 billion 2.1 billion.
Of the 0.1 billion Level 3 assets for which sensitivity analysis is not provided, it is estimated that a 10% change in valuation assumptions downwards of these assets would result in a change in fair value of approximately 10 million.
vi Liabilities The principal liabilities classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are: 3.4 billion 2014: nil of non-participating investment contract liabilities are classified as Level 3, either because the underlying unit funds are classified as Level 3 or because the liability relates to unfunded units or other non-unit adjustments which are based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable market data and assumptions.
Derivative liabilities of 0.9 billion 2014: 1.0 billion comprising over the counter derivatives such as credit default swaps and inflation swaps.
These swaps are valued using either discounted cash flow models or other valuation models.
Cash flows within these models may be adjusted based on assumptions reflecting the underlying credit risk and liquidity risk and these assumptions are deemed to be non-market observable.
0.5 billion 2014: 0.6 billion of securitised mortgage loan notes, presented within Borrowings, are valued using a similar technique to the related Level 3 securitised mortgage assets.
Remaining Level 3 liabilities amount to 0.3 billion 2014: nil and relate to a range of liabilities held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.
Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 liabilities to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 5.1 billion of the Groups Level 3 liabilities.
For these Level 3 liabilities, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value by approximately 0.5 billion.
