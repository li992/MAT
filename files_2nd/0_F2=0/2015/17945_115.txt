Contingent liabilities continued The group is subject to numerous national and local environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities.
These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties.
Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites.
In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities.
The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate.
However, the estimated cost of known environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
While the amounts of future costs that are not provided for could be significant and could be material to the groups results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not possible to estimate the amounts involved.
BP does not expect these costs to have a material effect on the groups financial position or liquidity.
If oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, BP could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning.
Furthermore, as described in Provisions, contingencies and reimbursement assets within Note 1, decommissioning provisions associated with downstream and petrochemical facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates.
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations where this is required for legal or contractual reasons.
Typically, losses will therefore be borne as they arise rather than being spread over time through insurance premiums.
Some risks are insured with third parties and reinsured through group insurance companies.
The position is reviewed periodically.
