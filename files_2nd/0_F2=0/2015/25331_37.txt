Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2015 continued 10.
Tax Accounting policy Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in past or future years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups asset liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The current tax charge credit in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is recognised net of receivables recognised for losses surrendered to unconsolidated Group subsidiary entities.
Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Consolidated Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.

As a consequence of the adoption of IFRS 10 investment entity consolidation exemption, underlying investee entity tax is not consolidated within these financial statements.
Total forecasted corporation tax payable by the Groups underlying investments is 753 million over their full concession lives.
