Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Significant Accounting Policies Daejan Holdings PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 23 July 2015. a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and these are presented on pages 67 to 70. b Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentational currency, rounded to the nearest thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative financial instruments, fixed rate loans and borrowings and current asset investments.
The accounting policies set out in this Note 1 have been applied consistently throughout the Group to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, except as described below.
The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations became effective for the year end 31 March 2015, but none of these has had a material impact on the Group: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation amendment IAS 36 Impairment of Assets amendment IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement amendment The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations relevant to the Group have been issued but are not yet effective.
None of these has been early-adopted by the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of these new standards on its financial reporting.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Corporate Governance Report on page 32.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events or amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those Page 43 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of complexity, judgement or estimation are set out in Note 1 u below.
c Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct relevant activities of an entity and an exposure to variable returns so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
d Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
e Income available for distribution Under the articles of association of certain Group investment undertakings, realised capital surpluses are not available for distribution as dividends.
f Foreign currency translation The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on re-translation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to IFRS.
The year end and average rates used for these purposes were as follows: Year end Average 2015 2014 2015 2014 US Dollar 1.48 1.66 1.61 1.59 g Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk arising from operational and financing activities.
As these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would recover or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
h Investment property IFRS defines investment properties as those which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
All of the Groups property falls within this definition.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and subsequently recorded at fair value.
External, independent valuation firms having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent relevant experience in the location and category of property being valued, value the portfolio annually at the Companys year end.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had Page 44 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The valuations are prepared either by considering the aggregate of the net annual rent receivable from the properties using a market yield which reflects the risks inherent in the net cash flow which is then applied to the net annual rents, or on a sales comparison basis.
Any gains or losses arising from a change in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be treated as an investment property, and is measured based on the fair value model.
Interest is capitalised on such developments to the extent that such interest is directly attributable to the cost of redevelopment.
A property interest under an operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property on a property-by-property basis when the Group holds it to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both.
Any such property interest under an operating lease classified as an investment property is carried at fair value.
Where material, the aggregate present value of the minimum future lease payments under such leases is recognised as a liability.
Acquisitions and disposals are recognised on the date that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Any resulting gain or loss based on the difference between sale proceeds and valuation is included in the income statement and taxation applicable thereto is shown as part of the taxation charge.
i Current investments Investments comprise equity securities and other investments held for trading and classified as current assets stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
j Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently carried at cost less an allowance for impairment.
These assets are not discounted as the effect is deemed immaterial.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term deposits.
These short term deposits are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Bank overdrafts are therefore included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved.
m Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
n Net rental income Net rental income comprises rent and service charges receivable less applicable provisions and costs associated with the properties.
Rental income from investment property leased out under operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the certain term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Service charge income is recognised as the services are provided.
Net rental income is stated net of recoverable VAT.
Page 45 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The cost of repairs is written off to the income statement in the year in which the expenditure was incurred.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
o Dividend income Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established which, in the case of quoted securities, is the ex-dividend date.
p Taxation Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities which, in the case of investment property, is assumed to be through sale, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
q Segmental reporting The Company has identified its operating segments on the basis of those components of the Group which engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses and for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Company has determined the Chief Operating Decision Maker to be the Board of Directors.
r Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than investment property see Note 1 h and deferred tax assets see Note 1 p, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-inuse.
The value-in-use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
s Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the Page 46 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
t Loans and borrowings Floating rate loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recorded at amortised cost.
Fixed rate loans and borrowings are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value.
In the case of floating rate loans and borrowings, transaction costs are deducted from the fair value at recognition and any differences between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
u Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out above.
Not all of these policies require management to make subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
The following is intended to provide further detail relating to those accounting policies that management consider particularly significant because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
i Property valuations The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective, depending on many factors, including the individual nature of each property, its location and expected future net rental values, market yields and comparable market transactions as set out in Note 9.
Therefore the valuations are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of difficult market or economic conditions.
As noted in Note 1 h above, all the Groups properties are valued by external valuers with appropriate qualifications and experience.
ii Income taxes The tax treatment of some transactions and calculations cannot be determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
In such cases, a best estimate of the relevant tax charge or credit is made, having regard to the extent of uncertainties associated with it.
Where the final outcome of such matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, those differences will be reflected in the income and deferred taxes amounts at the time of formal resolution.
Additionally, judgement has been exercised in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets where the utilisation of the underlying tax losses is uncertain.
Such resolution can take a long time to achieve due to the complexity of tax legislation.
Page 47 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued iii Fixed interest rate loans and borrowings The treatment of fixed rate debt at fair value through profit and loss reflects the Groups overall management, on a fair value basis, of its investment property portfolio together with the large majority of the debt which finances it.
This treatment also is in order to provide consistency of accounting measurement between fixed rate debt and floating rate debt which has been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps: these two categories of debt comprising the large majority of the Groups total loans and borrowings.
iv Valuation of hedging instruments and fixed rate debt The fair value of hedging instruments and fixed rate debt that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
Management, based on independent advice, uses its judgement to select appropriate methods and assumptions which are based mainly on market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
v Trade receivables Management uses details of the age of trade receivables and the status of any disputes together with external evidence of the credit status of the counterparty in making judgements concerning any need to impair the carrying values.
Segmental Analysis The Group is managed through two discrete geographical divisions and has only one product or service, being investment in property for the generation of rental income and or capital appreciation.
This is reflected in the Groups structure and in the segment information reviewed by the Board.

The aggregate amount of 1,444.5 million is based on open market values, assessed in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014.
The Groups USA investment properties were also independently professionally valued at 31 March 2015 by Joseph J. Blake and Associates Inc. and Metropolitan Valuation Services, Inc. both USA Certified General Real Estate Appraisers.
The aggregate amount of 418.1 million is based on open market values, assessed in accordance with the Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the Appraisal Institute.
All three valuers have recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.
The aggregate professional valuations included in the above table have been reduced by an amount of 7.4 million 2014 3.5 million, relating to lease incentives included in Trade and other receivables.
Page 52 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 As explained in Note 1 u i, property valuations are inherently subjective, depending on many factors, including the individual nature of each property, its location and expected future net rental values, market yields and comparable market transactions.
These fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
There have been no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the year.
Valuation techniques and key inputs The following table sets out the valuation techniques and key inputs for the main categories of property within the Groups portfolio, together with an indication of the inter-relationships between the key inputs and the fair value measurement.

There are inter-relationships between the groups of inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
Movements in more than one input having the effect of increasing fair value would give rise to a magnifying effect on the valuation.
Conversely, movements of inputs having opposite effects on fair value would have a mitigating effect on the valuation.

Financial Assets and Liabilities The Groups financial instruments are analysed into category as follows: 2015 2014 Financing Financing Carrying income Carrying income amount expense amount expense 000 000 000 000 Current asset investments 187 7 2,033 14 Current assets at fair value 187 7 2,033 14 Derivative financial instruments 3,958 137 4,095 2,375 Fixed rate loans and borrowings 239,390 14,790 211,437 160 Current and non-current liabilities at fair value 243,348 14,653 215,532 2,535 Trade and other receivables 55,586 222 46,833 480 Cash and cash equivalents 52,293 64 59,149 225 Current assets at amortised cost 107,879 286 105,982 705 Trade and other payables 41,921 12 41,210 14 Floating rate loans and borrowings 83,400 2,560 80,142 2,538 Current and non-current liabilities at amortised cost 125,321 2,572 121,352 2,552 Total financial instruments 260,603 16,932 228,869 674 Fair values of financial instruments The Groups financial instruments are either recorded at fair value or their fair values are not materially different from their carrying amounts.
At both the current and preceding year end there were no non-recurring fair value measurements.
The Group does not hedge account and all its mortgages and interest rate swaps are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value, with any movement being recorded in the consolidated income statement.
The fair values of all these financial instruments are determined by reference to observable inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Fair values have been determined by discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument, as adjusted to reflect the credit risk attributable to the Group and, where relevant, its counterparty.
Financial instrument risk management In common with all businesses, the Group is exposed to the following types of risk which arise from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk Page 60 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 This note presents information about the nature of the Groups exposure to such risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Reference to disclosures given elsewhere in the financial statements is included as appropriate.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, has delegated to the finance function the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of those objectives.
The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables from tenants.
Trade receivables The majority of the Groups rental income is demanded quarterly in advance and demands are sent out prior to the due date.
Management monitors arrears continually and prompt action is taken to address potential defaults as appropriate.
The credit worthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to the agreement of the lease.
Collateral is generally required by the Group to support lease obligations.
In many cases this takes the form of a tenant security deposit but also includes parent company guarantees or bank or other guarantees where appropriate.
Provision is made on a sliding scale against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt, with full provision for impairment usually being made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year.
Details of the Groups trade receivables and the extent of impairment provisions against them are set out in Note 11.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical locations, the Board does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
Cash and derivative financial instruments The credit rating of counterparties to financial instruments is kept under review.
The Groups interest rate swaps are currently out-of-the-money: consequently, counterparty risk on swaps does not represent a major risk at the current time.
The counterparty risk on cash and short-term deposits is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any institution by reference to their credit rating.
Such balances are generally placed with major financial institutions where credit risk is not considered significant.
Maximum exposure The aggregate carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets, which are stated net of impairment provisions, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking into account the value of the tenant security deposits held and other collateral.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of its working capital and the finance charges and amortisation of its loans and borrowings.
Page 61 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The Groups policy is to seek to maintain cash balances to meet all short and medium term requirements.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole and has long standing relationships with many leading banks and financial institutions from which the Board expect to be able to raise further funds if required.
At 31 March 2015, gearing was 16.4 per cent.
on the basis of gross debt to gross assets.
Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2015, were 52.3 million 2014 59.1 million and 21.8 million of loans and borrowings were repayable within one year 2014 7.7 million.
In addition, at the same date, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 48.8 million 2014 35.0 million, which expire between 2017 and 2020.
The maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash flows arising from the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2015 was as follows: 2015 Aggregate Due Due Due Due after Carrying undiscounted within within within more than amount cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 83,400 83,400 1,375 21,375 60,650 Mortgages 239,390 221,009 17,287 13,559 66,431 123,732 Interest 74,459 10,592 9,655 21,637 32,575 Interest rate swaps 3,958 4,610 1,267 1,267 2,076 Trade and other payables 41,921 41,921 41,921 368,669 425,399 72,442 45,856 150,794 156,307 2014 Aggregate Due Due Due Due after Carrying undiscounted within within within more than amount cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 80,142 80,142 1,375 27,986 50,781 Mortgages 211,437 199,757 3,811 15,762 79,066 101,118 Interest 69,789 9,700 9,427 19,838 30,824 Interest rate swaps 4,095 5,926 1,278 1,278 3,370 Trade and other payables 41,210 41,210 41,210 336,884 396,824 57,374 54,453 153,055 131,942 Market risk Market risk arises mainly from the impact that changes in interest rates might have on the cost of Group borrowing and the impact that changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate might have on the Groups USA net assets.
Interest rates The Group seeks to reduce the interest rate risk by fixing rates on a majority of its loans and borrowings, whilst maintaining some loans at floating rates in order to retain flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
Interest rates are fixed either through the use of fixed rate mortgage finance or through interest rate swaps.
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these only to limit exposure to potential interest rate fluctuations.
The interest rate profile of the Groups loans and borrowings is set out in Note 15.
Page 62 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 0.6 million per annum, on the basis of the floating rate debt outstanding at 31 March 2015, after taking account of the interest swaps in place.
There also exists a risk to the income statement arising from the recognition and re-measurement of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps at fair value.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would give rise to a reduction in fair value of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 March 2015 of 12.3 million, together with a corresponding increase in the Groups profit before taxation.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps held by the Group at the year end were as follows: Contracted rate excluding margin Notional principal Fair value 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Per cent.
000 000 000 000 Maturing within two to five years 5.6 5.6 25,000 25,000 3,958 4,095 Foreign exchange rates The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk in relation to its USA net assets by funding its USA investment property with US dollar denominated loans and borrowings.
As the Groups investment in USA assets are held for the long term and funds are not usually returned to the UK, the Groups policy is not to hedge its residual exposure.
Management monitors exchange rates on a regular basis and elects to transfer funds only when the rate is favourable to do so.
It is estimated that a 10 per cent depreciation of the US dollar against sterling would cause a decrease in the sterling value of the Groups USA net assets of 15.8 million.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent together with net debt.
This is kept under constant review to ensure the Group has sufficient capital to fund its operations and that the Groups strategy of low gearing is maintained.
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between longer-term finance appropriate to fund its long-term investment property holding strategy and cost effectiveness, given availability of debt in the market.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Net debt comprises a mix of fixed rate mortgages and shorter-term bank loans as set out in Note 15 and cash and short term deposits as set out in Note 12.
All loans and borrowings are secured against investment property and the bank loans are drawn against committed facilities.
Related Party Transactions Day-to-day management of the Groups properties and its operations in the UK is mainly carried out by Highdorn Co. Limited and by Freshwater Property Management Limited.
Mr B S E Freshwater and Mr S I Freshwater are Directors of both companies.
They have no beneficial interest in the share capital of Highdorn Co. Limited.
Mr B S E Freshwater, Mr S I Freshwater and Mr D Davis are Directors of the parent company of Freshwater Property Management Limited but have no beneficial interest in either company.
Mr R E Freshwater has a beneficial interest in a trust holding interests in shares in Highdorn Co. Limited.
Page 63 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued In their capacity as property managing agents, Highdorn Co. Limited and Freshwater Property Management Limited collect rents and incur direct property expenses on behalf of the Group.
At 31 March 2015, the aggregate net amounts due to the Group from Highdorn Co. Limited and Freshwater Property Management Limited was 5.9 million 2014 4.2 million.
These amounts are not secured and are payable on demand.
No guarantees have been given or received and the amounts are settled in cash.
The amounts paid and payable by the Group for the provision of property and other management services by Highdorn Co. Limited and Freshwater Property Management Limited, included above, were as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Balance due to related party managing agents at 1 April 951 845 Charged during the year 3,666 3,629 Paid during the year 530 3,523 Balance due to related party managing agents at 31 March 4,087 951 The Directors interests in the Company and the principal shareholders are described on page 22 and 23.
The Board considers that the Directors are the key management personnel of the Group and their remuneration is disclosed on page 26.
Contingent Liabilities The Group is from time to time party to legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors are not aware of any current actions which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Operating Lease Agreements The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases which vary in terms and provisions between type of property and type of tenure.
Leases providing for contingent rents are rare within the Groups property portfolio and no amounts for contingent rents are included in rental income for the year 2014 Nil.
At the balance sheet date, future minimum lease payments receivable by the Group under operating leases were as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Due within one year 71,932 67,206 Due within one to two years 44,778 40,172 Due within two to five years 98,554 78,755 Due after more than five years 303,841 205,734 519,105 391,867 Many of the Groups residential properties are let under assured shorthold tenancies which typically are for initial terms of 12 months or less, whereafter they are cancellable at short notice.
The Groups experience is that a significant proportion of such tenancies are held over after the expiry of their initial term.
