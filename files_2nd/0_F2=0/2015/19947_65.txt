Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6.
Taxation continued We hold a deferred tax liability of 40 million 2014: nil in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the balance sheet date see table above.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 14,925 million 2014: 22,985 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because we are in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.
