The second quarter saw a more challenging environment for systematic strategies, with losses driven by BlueTrend and BlueCrest Quantitative Equity BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit was also modestly negative offsetting the modest contributions from the remaining four strategies.

The year saw a number of changes within the AllBlue portfolio including: As of 1 January 2015, Systematica Investments became the investment manager for BlueTrend.
Systematica Investments was spun out of BlueCrest to manage several systematic strategies.
This migration was completed successfully, without any significant impact to the AllBlue portfolio.
As of 1 June, the BlueCrest Mercantile management fee was reduced from 2% per annum to 1.5% per annum.
As of 1 July, AllBlue changed the vehicle through which it accesses BlueTrends trend-following strategy to BlueTrend 2x Leveraged.
This enabled AllBlue to gain similar exposure with greater cash efficiency, enabling AllBlue to make additional allocations to its other underlying funds.
