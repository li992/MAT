During the year ended 30 September 2015 the Government announced provisions further reducing the rate of corporation tax to 19.0% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18.0% from 1 April 2020 which were enacted shortly after the year end.
Therefore the standard rate of corporation tax applicable to the Group for the year ended 30 September 2014 was 22.0%, the rate for the year ended 30 September 2015 was 20.5%, the rate in the year ending 30 September 2016 is expected to be 20.0%, the rate in the year ending 30 September 2017 is expected to be 19.5%, the rate in the years ending 30 September 2018 and 30 September 2019 are expected to be 19.0%, the rate in the year ending 30 September 2020 is expected to be 18.5% and the rate in subsequent years is expected to be 18.0%.
The expected impact on deferred tax balances of the changes to 21.0% and 20.0% was accounted for in the year ended 30 September 2013 and the expected impact of the changes to 19.0% and 18.0% will be accounted for in the year ending 30 September 2016.
The UK Government has also introduced a tax surcharge of 8% on the profits of banks, effective from 1 January 2016.
Paragon Bank PLC, the Groups banking subsidiary, is subject to this legislation, but in the near term it is not anticipated that its profits will exceed the 25.0m threshold above which the surcharge applies.
