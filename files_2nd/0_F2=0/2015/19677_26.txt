Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses.
Impairment The carrying values of the Companys assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
When a subsequent event or change in circumstances causes the recoverable amount of an asset to increase, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the profit and loss account.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except where it relates to items taken directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
The Company has not adopted a policy of discounting deferred tax balances, as permitted by FRS 19.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Share-based payment compensation The Company has granted equity-settled share awards to Group employees.
Equity-settled awards are measured at fair value at grant date.
The fair value of awards granted to employees of the Company is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will actually vest.
The cost of awards to employees of subsidiary undertakings is accounted for as an additional investment in the employing subsidiary.
