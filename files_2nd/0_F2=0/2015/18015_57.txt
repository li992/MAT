Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 139 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Provisions continued Asset Services settlements provision: relates to two matters: 1.
Arch Cru: The parties to the CF Arch Cru Funds group litigation have entered into a full and final settlement of the proceedings on confidential terms.
It is expected this matter will be completed by the close of 2016.
Connaught: The potential costs in resolving the matter relating to Connaught Income Series 1 Fund The Fund, of which CFM was the Operator until September 2009, when it was replaced by another Operator company unrelated to Capita following which CFM had no further involvement with the Fund.
The Fund went into liquidation in 2012 and its liquidator brought a claim against both former Operators.
The Group has reached a settlement with the liquidator in respect of its involvement.
The Financial Conduct Authority FCA was supporting the negotiations being undertaken between all parties but on 10 March 2015 confirmed that it had withdrawn from the negotiations and has decided to formally review the activities of both Operators.
At this time no conclusion has been reached on whether any wrongdoing has occurred and whether any enforcement action will be taken.
Whilst there can be no certainty that a liability will not arise in respect of this matter, the Group is unable to determine what the outcome of the FCA review might be and as such no provision for a potential outflow of funds has been made.
Due to the requirement to await the outcome of the formal review commenced by the FCA, this matter is now likely to come to a conclusion later in 2016.
Giving due consideration to available information regarding these claims the Group has made a further provision of 17.2m representing an increased settlement value for the Arch Cru matter and further legal and professional fees.
The Group has incurred 21.7m in respect of compensation payments and professional fees in relation to these matters in the year.
Claims and litigation provision: In addition to the Asset Services Settlement provision the Group is exposed to other claims and litigation.
The Group makes a provision when a claim has been made where it is more probable than not that a loss might occur.
These provisions are reassessed regularly to ensure that the level of provisioning is consistent with the claims that have been reported.
The range of values attached to these claims, can be significant and, where obligations are probable and estimable, provisions are made representing the Groups best estimate of the expenditure to be incurred.
The Group robustly defends its position on each claim and they are often settled for amounts significantly smaller than the initial claim and may result in no transfer of economic benefits.
In the period, the Group has settled a number of insurance liabilities which it had provided for in previous years.
Additionally, it has made provision for new claims, which originate due to the nature of the Groups activities and revised existing provisions where more information on the progress of the claim has become apparent.
The Groups exposure to claims is mitigated by having in place a number of large insurers providing cover for the Groups activities, albeit insurance recoveries are only recognised as an asset at the point the recovery is virtually certain.
No such assets are recognised currently.
Due to the nature of these claims the Group cannot give an estimate of the period over which this provision will unwind.
Property provision: Includes a provision, on a discounted basis, for the difference between the market value of property leases acquired in 2011 with the Ventura and Vertex Private Sector acquisitions and the lease obligations committed to at the date the leases were signed by the previous owners.
This is in accordance with IFRS 3 revised which requires the use of fair value measurement.
The remaining property provision is made on a discounted basis for the future rent expense and related cost of leasehold property net of estimated sub-lease income where the space is vacant or currently not planned to be used for ongoing operations.
The expectation is that this expenditure will be incurred over the remaining periods of the leases which range from 1 to 24 years.
Other provision: relates to provisions in respect of other potential exposures arising due to the nature of some of the operations that the Group provides.
These are likely to unwind over a period of 1 to 3 years.
26 Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments are comprised of cash, bank loans, bond issues, loan notes, finance leases and derivatives.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions.
These are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, fixed rate interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Their purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments The following table analyses by classification and category the Groups financial instruments excluding short-term debtors, creditors, fund payables receivables and cash in hand that are carried in the financial statements.
The values below represent the carrying amounts.
The carrying values are a reasonable approximation of fair value other than 9 fixed rate bonds totalling 445.9m, included below in the bond value of 1,749.4m, with a carrying value of 445.9m and a fair value of 445.0m.
The fair value of these bonds has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and this fair value measurement would be categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

To remove the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations it has entered into currency swaps which effectively hedge the movement in the bonds fair value due to changes in prevailing foreign exchange and interest rates.
The interest rate swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of GBP denominated bonds.
The fair values of the currency and interest swaps are disclosed in note 16 Financial assets and in note 22 Financial liabilities.

The valuation models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.
Unlisted equity securities and investment loans are held at amortised cost.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with multiple counterparties, all of which are financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial instruments continued As at 31 December 2015, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2015 2014 m m Assets measured at fair value Disposal group assets held for sale 84.1 Non-designated foreign exchange forwards and swaps 0.3 Foreign exchange swaps held for foreign net investment 0.2 Interest rate swaps in relation to GBP denominated bonds 6.9 9.8 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 213.9 175.6 Liabilities measured at fair value Disposal group liabilities held for sale 40.4 Bonds 1,303.5 1,181.8 Cash flow hedges 14.8 18.7 Non-designated foreign exchange forwards and swaps 9.9 1.2 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 0.6 Fixed rate interest rate swaps 67.0 63.3 Public sector subsidiary partnership payment 56.5 54.3 Put options of non-controlling interests 136.6 109.4 Contingent consideration 31.5 56.1 During both years, the Group only had Level 2 assets or liabilities measured at fair value apart from disposal group assets and liabilities held for sale, contingent consideration, the public sector subsidiary partnership payment and the put options of non-controlling interests which are Level 3 liabilities.
It is the Groups policy to recognise transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
Contingent consideration arises in business acquisitions where the Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 3 years in duration and will be settled in cash and loan notes on their payment date on achieving the relevant target.
The Group makes provision for such contingent consideration for each acquisition based on an assessment of its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the expected contingent consideration of 31.5m.
The sensitivity analysis performed adjusted the probability of payment of the contingent amounts.
A 10% increase in the probability of contingent consideration being paid results in an increase in potential contingent consideration of 3.8m.
A 10% decrease in the probability of the contingent consideration being paid results in a decrease in potential contingent consideration of 4.3m.
The public sector subsidiary partnership payment liability is an estimate of the annual preferred payments to be made by Axelos Limited the partnership formed with the Cabinet Office to the Cabinet Office in years 2017 to 2022.
This payment is funded by Axelos Limited and is contingent on profits.
The fair value of 56.5m has been derived by discounting the expected payment at the Group cost of debt to arrive at its present value.
If the discount rate was to increase decrease by 1% the present value would decrease increase by 2.1m.
The put options of the non-controlling interests see note 22 are measured at amortised cost based on the expected redemption value of the shares that will be paid in cash by the Group.
This value is determined by reference to the expected date of exercise of the options, which is then discounted to arrive at a present value.
The sensitivity of the valuation to movements in both the discount rate and the cash flows that have been used to calculate it, are as follows: a 10% increase decrease in the earnings potential of the business results in a 12.8m increase decrease in the valuation: a 1% increase decrease in the discount rate applied to the valuation results in a 4.6m decrease 4.8m increase in the valuation.
The fair values of assets and liabilities presented as being held for sale have been assessed based on expected sales proceeds.

The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Group has issued fixed rate coupon US$ denominated bonds, which have been swapped to floating rate GBP liabilities at the date of issuance using currency swaps.
These currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the bonds due to changes in prevailing foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
Capita has executed a series of fixed rate interest rate swaps to convert from paying floating rate GBP interest to fixed rate GBP interest on certain of its swapped bonds.
These fixed rate interest rate swaps are not designated in any hedge relationship so their change in fair value is recognised in net finance costs in the income statement see note 9 Net finance costs.
Due to lower prevailing interest rates, these fixed rate interest rate swaps have a negative mark to market value of 67.0m at 31 December 2015 2014: negative mark to market value of 63.3m.
This movement results in a non-cash accounting loss in the year of 3.7m 2014: loss of 36.7m.
The Group has fixed rate bonds of 1,074.0m in issue as at 31 December 2015 underlying nominal value.
The Group has a further 456.5m of swapped bonds underlying nominal value, 300.0m of term loans, a 600m undrawn credit facility and a 600.0m undrawn committed revolving credit facility, all paying floating rate interest based on LIBOR.
This gives the Group, as a whole, a balanced interest rate risk profile through the use of both fixed and floating rate financial instruments.
The interest rate profile of the interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December is as follows: Within Between Between Between Between More 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years than 5 years Total At 31 December 2015 m m m m m m m Fixed rate Bonds 184.7 129.6 135.4 111.0 185.8 489.2 1,235.7 Obligations under finance leases 5.1 1.9 7.0 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 3.8 3.8 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 43.7 40.7 44.3 6.0 3.9 21.1 159.7 Fixed rate interest rate swaps 2.3 2.5 7.8 10.5 17.7 26.2 67.0 Floating rate Cash in hand 534.0 534.0 Overdraft 448.7 448.7 Investment loan 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 3.9 5.0 Bonds 34.9 82.3 119.8 276.7 513.7 Term loan 200.0 100.0 300.0 Cash flow hedges 3.3 3.8 4.2 3.5 14.8 Non-designated foreign exchange forwards and swaps 2.6 2.0 1.6 1.7 1.7 9.6 Foreign exchange swaps in respect of foreign net investment 0.2 0.2 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 3.1 3.1 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 1.1 20.4 7.8 24.9 54.2 Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 144 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial instruments continued Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total At 31 December 2014 m m m m m m m Fixed rate Bonds 24.4 182.9 128.2 95.7 109.5 342.6 883.3 Obligations under finance leases 5.1 5.3 1.5 11.9 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 4.7 4.7 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 42.0 38.7 29.3 4.2 13.1 127.3 Fixed rate interest rate swaps 0.4 6.0 7.4 8.3 11.9 29.3 63.3 Floating rate Cash in hand 458.9 458.9 Overdraft 429.8 429.8 Investment loan 0.2 0.3 0.3 4.2 5.0 Bonds 86.5 33.5 115.7 187.8 423.5 Term loan 200.0 100.0 300.0 Cash flow hedges 3.1 3.9 4.1 4.3 3.3 18.7 Non-designated foreign exchange forwards and swaps 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.3 1.2 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 1.3 3.8 5.1 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 13.2 0.3 28.8 6.0 47.7 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

Increase decrease Effect on profit in basis points before tax m 2015 5 5 0.3 0.3 2014 1 1 0.1 0.1 Foreign currency risk The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk where it has cash flows in overseas operations and foreign currency transactions in UK operations which are affected by foreign exchange movements.
The Group is not generally exposed to significant foreign currency risk except in respect of its cash flows in overseas operations in Europe, India and South Africa which generate exposure to movements in the Euro, Swiss Franc, Indian Rupee and South African Rand exchange rates against sterling.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this exposure by entering forward currency contracts including Non-deliverable Forward Contracts NDFs to fix the GBP cost of highly probable forecast transactions denominated in Indian Rupees and South African Rand.
It is the Groups policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the underlying cash flows in order to maximise hedge effectiveness.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held foreign exchange forwards against forecast monthly Indian Rupee and South African Rand costs in years up to and including 2022.
These forecast costs have been determined on the basis of the underlying cash flows associated with the delivery of services under signed customer contracts.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Indian Rupee and South African Rand exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts.

Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 145 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial instruments continued Hedges Fair value hedges The Group has in issue fixed rate dollar and sterling bonds which it has hedged through a combination of interest rate and currency swaps.
The Group had interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of 85.0m 2014: 117.0m whereby it receives a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 4.81% 2014: fixed rate of interest 5.46% and pays variable rates based on 6 month GBP LIBOR.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 85.0m 2014: 117.0m of the Groups bonds.
The Group had in place currency swaps whereby it receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate based on 6 month GBP LIBOR.
The currency swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 999.6m 2014: 857.1m of the Groups bonds, which have coupon rates ranging from 3.33% to 6.51%.
The currency swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its US dollar issued bonds.
The bonds, currency and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms including the amount and the date of maturity see note 22.
The total gain in the year on the fair value hedges of 36.5m 2014: total gain 50.9m, excluding credit risk, was equal to the loss on the hedged items resulting in no net gain or loss in the income statement.
The Group may, at its option, upon notice of not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days, repay at any time all or part of the notes at no more than the present value of future payments.
Cash flow hedges As noted above, the Group holds a series of forward exchange currency contracts in the form of NDFs designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions in INR of the Groups Indian operations.
2015 2014 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Forward exchange contracts m m m m Fair value 14.8 18.7 The terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
The cash flow hedges are in respect of highly probable forecast monthly costs, based on long term contracts that the Group has in place, denominated in INR up to 2019.
These were assessed to be highly effective as at 31 December 2015 and a net unrealised loss of 14.8m 2014: loss of 18.7m less deferred tax of 2.8m 2014: 3.7m was recognised in equity.
The net gain recognised on cash flow hedges during the year was 0.8m 2014: net gain 5.6m whilst net losses of 3.1m 2014: losses of 6.0m were reclassified to the income statement and included in administrative expenses.
The tax effect of the net movement in cash flow hedges during the year was a debit of 1.1m 2014: debit of 2.3m.
In addition the Group holds a series of forward exchange currency contracts against highly probable forecast transactions in ZAR of the Groups South African operations.
The Group does not designate these hedges as cash flow hedges under IFRS.
All gains or losses on these outstanding hedges are recognised in the income statement in net finance costs see note 9.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group has net investments in foreign operations, the re-translation of which on consolidation gives rise to exposure to the carrying values in equity.
The Group designates EUR97m of liability under its borrowings in EUR denominated bonds as a hedge of a net investment in its EUR denominated foreign operations.
In addition the Group designates CHF110m of foreign exchange forwards and swaps as a hedge of net investment in its Swiss Franc denominated foreign operations as at 31 December 2015. Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that all clients who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, such as cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial investments, investment loan and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages its operations to avoid any excessive concentration of counterparty risk and the Group takes all reasonable steps to seek assurance from the counterparties to ensure that they can fulfil their obligations.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
The mark to market movement on derivatives includes the extent to which the fair value of these instruments has been affected by the perceived change in the creditworthiness of the counterparties to those instruments and that of the Group itself own credit risk.
The Group is comfortable that the risk attached to those counterparties is not significant and believes that the currency swaps continue to act as an effective hedge against the movements in the fair value of the Groups issued US$ denominated bonds.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold cash and undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium term capital and funding obligations, including organic growth and acquisition activities, and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and undrawn committed facilities to enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a daily cash management process.
This process considers the maturity of both the Groups financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of multiple sources of funding including bonds, bank loans, term loans, loan notes, cash, overdrafts and finance leases over a broad spread of maturities to 2027.
Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 146 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial instruments continued The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2015 based on contractual undiscounted payments.
For currency swaps, only payments are included, receipts are excluded.
Master netting or similar agreements The Group has notional cash pools with its banks under which the bank may net cash balances with overdrafts held by other members of the Group.
The effect of this is shown in the table below.

The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in the light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
Focus on capital management forms an important component of the monthly Board meetings with attention on various matters including: return on capital employed, ensuring a mix of funding sources to ensure continuity and flexibility, a balance between fixed and floating borrowings and a broad spread of maturities together with attention to ensuring adequate liquidity headroom.
The Groups capital management process ensures that it meets financial covenants in its borrowing arrangements.
Breaches in meeting the financial covenants could permit the lenders to immediately accelerate repayment of loans and borrowings.
The Group monitors, as part of its monthly Board review, that it will adhere to specified consolidated leverage ratios and consolidated net interest expense coverage ratios.
There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any loans and borrowings in the period.
The Group has a business model that is driven by organic growth and through the acquisition of smalland medium-sized entities which enhance existing portfolios or provide access to new markets.
The availability of funds for this acquisition activity is thus a key consideration when determining the use and management of capital.
The Group therefore uses longer dated debt, generally bonds and long-term bank facilities, to enable it to finance these purchases.
Capita plc supports the growth of its various financial services businesses, which form a key part of its overall strategy and business plan.
These financial firms are subject to various capital requirements imposed by financial services regulators.
These requirements do not apply to Capita plc itself and the Group is not required to provide consolidated returns for regulatory purposes.
The board of each regulated firm is responsible for ensuring it has embedded capital management frameworks that test there are adequate financial resources at all times.
During the year, they complied with all externally imposed financial services regulatory capital requirements.
The Group seeks to maintain a conservative and efficient capital structure with an appropriate level of gearing.
It is Group policy to target a long term net debt to EBITDA ratio in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 and maintain interest cover above 7.0 times.
At 31 December 2015, our annualised net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.5 2014: 2.2 with annualised interest cover at 13.7 times 2014: 16.3 times.
These ratios are monitored monthly by the Board.
As the Group considers a long-term net debt to EBITDA ratio the most appropriate measure for gearing, it does not maintain or monitor a targeted debt equity ratio.
The Group raises debt in a number of markets including the bank loan market, bank overdraft, finance lease and bond markets.
The Group has available to it a committed Revolving Credit Facility of 600m maturing in August 2020 and a 600m Credit Facility maturing in June 2017, of which nil was drawn down as at 31 December 2015 2014: nil drawn down on a 600m Revolving Credit Facility.
These facilities are both available for the Groups immediate use.
During the year the Group issued a total of US$293.5m and 97.0m of new bonds.
In addition, the Group issued bonds with a total face value of EUR310.0m at a discount, receiving net proceeds of EUR304.4m.
The Group has a spread of bond maturities over many years to 2027 see note 22.
The Groups dividend policy is to return surplus cash to shareholders through a mixture of progressive dividends and, when appropriate, capital returns.
Total dividends have grown at a compound rate of 9.6% over the 5 years to 31 December 2015 whilst dividend cover in the year is 2.23 times.
The Group returned 155m capital to shareholders by means of a special dividend in 2007 and undertakes share buybacks on an opportunistic basis, as market conditions allow, in order to maintain an efficient capital structure and to minimise its long-term cost of capital.
