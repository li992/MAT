17 Financial investments Accounting policy Treasury bills, debt securities and equity securities intended to be held on a continuing basis, other than those designated at fair value, are classified as available for sale or held to maturity.
They are recognised on the trade date when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements to purchase those instruments, and are normally derecognised when either the securities are sold or redeemed.
i Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus direct and incremental transaction costs.
They are subsequently remeasured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are either sold or become impaired.
When available-for-sale financial assets are sold, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as Gains less losses from financial investments.
Interest income is recognised over a debt securitys expected life.
Premiums and or discounts arising on the purchase of dated debt securities are included in the interest recognised.
Dividends from equity assets are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
ii Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that HSBC positively intends and is able to hold to maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment losses.
The accounting policy relating to impairments of available-for-sale securities is presented in Note 1.
Available-for-sale financial assets are reclassified to held to maturity if there is a change in intention or ability to hold those assets to maturity due to a change in the way they are managed.
The fair value on reclassification becomes the new amortised cost and the assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost rather than fair value.
