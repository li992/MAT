16 Derivatives Accounting policy Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, bonds, interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, commodities and equity or other indices.
Derivatives are recognised initially, and are subsequently measured, at fair value.
Fair values of derivatives are obtained either from quoted market prices or by using valuation techniques.
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Embedded derivatives are bifurcated from the host contract when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host non-derivative contract, their terms would otherwise meet the definition of a stand-alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value.
The bifurcated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes therein recognised in the income statement.
Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are only offset for accounting purposes if the offsetting criteria presented in Note 32 are met.
Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives, that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in Net trading income.
Gains and losses on derivatives managed in conjunction with financial instruments designated at fair value are reported in Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value together with the gains and losses on the economically hedged items.
Where the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value, the contractual interest is shown in Interest expense together with the interest payable on the issued debt.
Hedge accounting When derivatives are designated in hedge relationships, HSBC classifies them as either: i hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments fair value hedges : ii hedges of the variability in highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecast transaction cash flow hedges : or iii a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation net investment hedges.
HSBC formally designates and documents each hedge relationship from inception, setting out the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge along with the specifically identified hedging instrument, hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness.
The method selected to assess hedge effectiveness will depend on the risk management strategy.
To qualify for hedge accounting, HSBC requires that a hedge must be expected to be highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis for the duration of the hedge relationship with each hedge relationship subject to an ongoing retrospective and prospective hedge effectiveness assessment.
Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk.
If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued: the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement on a recalculated effective interest rate over the residual period to maturity, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income: the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement within Net trading income.
The accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the same periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
In hedges of forecast transactions that result in recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, previous gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
When a hedge relationship is discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the income statement.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 394 Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges.
A gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income: the residual change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement on the disposal, or part disposal, of the foreign operation.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Non-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not applied.

Trading derivatives Most of HSBCs derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities.
Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks.
Trading activities include market-making and risk management.
Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the purpose of generating revenues based on spread and volume.
Risk management activity is undertaken to manage the risk arising from client transactions, with the principal purpose of retaining client margin.
Other derivatives classified as held for trading include non-qualifying hedging derivatives.
Substantially all of HSBC Holdings derivatives entered into with subsidiaries are managed in conjunction with financial liabilities designated at fair value.
The notional contract amounts of derivatives held for trading purposes indicate the nominal value of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date: they do not represent amounts at risk.

Risk is typically controlled through entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts with other counterparties.
HSBC manages the credit risk arising on buying and selling credit derivative protection by including the related credit exposures within its overall credit limit structure for the relevant counterparty.
Trading of credit derivatives is restricted to a small number of offices within the major centres which have the control infrastructure and market skills to manage effectively the credit risk inherent in the products.
Credit derivatives are also deployed to a limited extent for the risk management of the Groups loan portfolios.
The notional contract amount of credit derivatives of $463bn 2014: $550bn consisted of protection bought of $237bn 2014: $272bn and protection sold of $226bn 2014: $278bn.
The credit derivative business operates within the market risk management framework described on page 211.
Derivatives valued using models with unobservable inputs The difference between the fair value at initial recognition the transaction price and the value that would have been derived had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is as follows: Unamortised balance of derivatives valued using models with significant unobservable inputs 2015 2014 $m $m Unamortised balance at 1 January 114 167 Deferral on new transactions 196 177 Recognised in the income statement during the year: 207 234 amortisation 121 114 subsequent to unobservable inputs becoming observable 2 13 maturity, termination or offsetting derivative 84 107 risk hedged Exchange differences 6 4 1 Unamortised balance at 31 December 97 114 1 This amount is yet to be recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting derivatives HSBC uses derivatives principally interest rate swaps for hedging purposes in the management of its asset and liability portfolios and structural positions.
This enables HSBC to optimise the overall cost to the Group of accessing debt capital markets, and to mitigate the market risk which would otherwise arise from structural imbalances in the maturity and other profiles of its assets and liabilities.

The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults.
The aggregate principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios over time form the basis for identifying gains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions.
