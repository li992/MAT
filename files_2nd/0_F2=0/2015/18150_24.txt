Goodwill and annual impairment review Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised, such as the value of the workforce, and is the only indefinite life intangible asset held by the Group.
The Group reviews goodwill for potential impairment of each cash generating unit CGU annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might beimpaired.
CGUs are typically considered to be Business Units.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
Businesses held for sale are assessed for impairment using expected net proceeds of divestment.
The calculation of recoverable value for CGUs based on value in use includes the following key assumptions: Cash flow forecasts for the following five years prepared as part of the annual strategic planning process and approved by management, updated where appropriate for more recent forecasts.
These forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment including factors such as the continued uncertainty within certain markets in which we operate.
The growth rates assume that demand for the Groups products in the US and in the UKremains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment and a recovery from the current weakness in the Marine SATCOM market.
They also assumethe realisation of planned synergy benefits from the committed integration plans for the Aeroflex businesses.
Taking into account the expectation offuture market conditions, management believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct costs will reflect past practices: Growth rates assumed after this five year period are based on long term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The long term projections used arein the range 1.2% to 2.5% 2014: 1.5% to 2.0% : Cash flows are discounted using the Groups WACC, adjusted for country and currency risks in the principal territories in which the Group operates.
These pre-tax discount rates are within the range 9.2% to 11.0% 2014: 8.3% to 10.5% : Cash flows include the impact of working capital and fixed asset requirements: and Cash flows include management charges which allocate central overheads to the CGUs.
The Directors consider CGUs to be individually significant where the goodwill allocated to a CGU represents more than 10% of the Groups total carrying value of goodwill.
These CGUs, representing 71% of total goodwill, are as follows: Goodwill Projected 5 carrying value Headroom Pre-tax year growth Projected GDP CGU Operating segment m m discount rate rate growth rate Integrated Electronic Solutions Advanced Electronic Solutions 220 131 9.6% 11.0% 1.9% Semiconductor Solutions Advanced Electronic Solutions 215 5 9.6% 14.0% 1.9% SATCOM Communications and Connectivity 222 288 9.4% 13.0% 1.4% Wireless Communications and Connectivity 153 198 9.3% 7.0% 2.0% Sensitivity analysis has been performed on these CGUs.
Semiconductor Solutions forms part of the Aeroflex business acquired in 2014 and therefore is initially expected to have low headroom.
For this CGU impairment losses would be 99m if the discount rate was increased to 11.5%, 68m if the growth rate was zero and 93m if cash flows reduced by 20%.
No impairment losses would arise on any of the other significant CGUs under these flexed assumptions.
If the integration of the other Aeroflex businesses is not successfully implemented resulting in lower than assumed synergy benefits then the headroom in these CGUs would be significantly reduced.
Sensitivity analysis included considering the current market weakness in Marine SATCOM and, assuming that the market returns to expected levels within the next five years, no impairment provision would be required.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

These do not meet the criteria for offsetting because the right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events such as a default and amounts presented inthe Balance Sheet are therefore presented on a gross basis.

com 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since 2003 and the UK schemes will be closed to future accrual from 1 April 2016.
The Group also manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements, where the Groups contribution is fixed at a set percentage of employees pay.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, as described below: Volatility of investment returns.
If the investment return is lower than the discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields then the scheme deficit will increase: Inflation risk.
Pensionable salaries, deferred pensions and pensions in payment are subject to inflationary increases.
A higher inflation rate will lead to higher defined benefit obligations: Changes in bond yields.
Volatility in the financial markets can have a significant impact on corporate bond yields which are used to generate a discount rate assumption.
Lower corporate bond yields will lead to higher defined benefit obligations: Life expectancy risk.
The schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and therefore increases in life expectancy will lead to higher defined benefit obligations.
The trustees seek to mitigate these risks and have invested in liability driven investments that mitigate bond yield, inflation and investment risks.
The remaining assets include significant investment in diversified growth funds which seek to manage investment risks.
In addition there have been a number of buy-in arrangements where assets are transferred to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides an income stream equivalent to the obligations to pensioners covered by the arrangement.
The most significant buy-in arrangement relates to pensioners of the CPP as at 1 July 2013.
The insurance contract assets aremeasured at a value equal to the related liabilities, mitigating the risks associated with those liabilities.
Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries: the mostrecent valuation was as at 1 April 2015.
This involves a detailed review of membership movements and generated experience gains of 12.2m recognised in theyear.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2015.
In the UK, within 15 months of each triennial valuation, the employer and the trustees are required to agree a schedule of contributions to ensure that the Plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent basis.
The Group expects to contribute 19.1m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2016 and 18.4m in 2017.
This includes 17.6m 2017: 17.6m related to deficit funding.
In November 2015, following member consultation, it was agreed that the CPP will be closed to future accrual from 1 April 2016.
This has resulted in the recognition of curtailment gains amounting to 9.8m in the Income Statement.
This is partly offset by increased commutation factors, of 7.1m, recognised as a past service cost.
1.5m of curtailment gains arose from the Groups restructuring activity and has been treated as non-underlying.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2015 or 2014 for the defined benefit schemes.
0.7m 2014: 1.3m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2015.
The principal financial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2015 2014 UK USA UK USA schemes scheme schemes scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 3.45% 3.45% 3.45% 3.45% Rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.20% 3.20% 3.20% 3.20% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.20% 3.20% 2.20% 3.20% Discount rate 3.80% 4.13% 3.50% 3.50% Inflation assumption 3.20% 3.20% 3.20% 3.20% The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actuarial tables which reflect actual recent mortality experience and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality tables used to estimate life expectancy are known as SAPS CMI 14 2014: SAPS CMI 13.
In practical terms, this is demonstrated in the table below: Further life Year of birth Year age 65 expectancy Male 1950 2015 22.8 years Female 1950 2015 24.8 years Male 1980 2045 25.6 years Female 1980 2045 27.7 years At 31 December 2015 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 25% 2014: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions, after adjusting for liabilities covered by insurance contracts, is provided below: Change in assumption Change in liabilities Discount rate Increase by 0.5% -4% Inflation rate Increase by 0.5% 3% Life expectancy Increase by 1 year 2% If the change in assumptions were in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact would be approximately symmetrical.

Of the actuarial losses recognised in the year, the changes in financial assumptions are primarily driven by the movements in the discount rate.

Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to time to manage exposures such as inflation risk.
The financial risk management policies agreed by the Board have not changed during the year and are summarised below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk The Group is based in the UK, reports in sterling and has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, Australia and other European countries.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practical, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk and, consequently, the net foreign exchange gains and losses included in the Income Statement amounted to a gain of 12.1m 2014: 5.8m.
All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The Group has the following exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Balance Sheet, translated into sterling at the relevant year-end exchange rates: 2015 2014 Restated Monetary Monetary Monetary Monetary m assets liabilities assets liabilities US dollars 340.9 1,569.7 350.1 1,614.9 Euros 100.2 143.5 109.4 82.8 Australian dollars 30.6 42.0 47.4 45.8 Danish kroner 4.1 53.9 16.1 77.7 Other currencies 30.4 8.4 45.5 11.7 506.2 1,817.5 568.5 1,832.9 Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities 225.8 108.6 143.5 128.8 732.0 1,926.1 712.0 1,961.7 Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange differences arising from the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group typically borrows in the currency of the acquisition and uses intercompany debt to create a natural economic hedge.
Monetary liabilities in the table above include US dollar borrowings of 1,330.2m 2014: 1,305.4m and Danish krone borrowings of 41.6m 2014: 71.0m which match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets.
Foreign currency contracts are also used to manage exposure to currency risks.
On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries which include the monetary assets and liabilities shown in the table above are translated at closing exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in OCI and through the translation reserve note 25.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the income statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts.

The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currencies, with a negative number indicating a reduction in profit after taxation or total equity.
The sensitivities below represent managements assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, based on experience over the previous five years.

It includes the effect of derivative financial instruments.
In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency, as follows: 2015 2014 m Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity US dollars to sterling 10% 17.8 17.8 10% 9.1 9.1 US dollars to Danish kroner 10% 13.4 13.4 10% 15.0 15.0 Euros to sterling 10% 6.3 6.3 10% 5.4 5.4 Interest rate risk The Group has long and short term borrowings at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
In managing its borrowing costs, the Group monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates, having regard to prevailing market conditions and, where necessary, uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.. m 2015 2014 Senior notes 822.7 777.6 Bank loans at fixed rate 50.8 48.1 Bank loans swapped to fixed rate 24.1 30.8 Fixed rate borrowings 897.6 856.5 Bank loans and overdrafts 498.3 492.2 Senior notes 105.1 99.4 Finance leases 0.5 0.2 Floating rate borrowings 603.9 591.8 Total borrowings 1,501.5 1,448.3 All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
com 108 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Floating to fixed interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, have been used to mitigate the interest rate exposure arising on selected floating rate debt.
Interest rate swaps outstanding at the year end are as follows: Period of swap contract 2015 2014 Currency Currency Hedged item Fixed rate from to value m value m Australian dollar loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$41.5m 20.5 AUS$49.7m 26.1 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$7.2m 3.6 AUS$9.0m 4.7 24.1 30.8 The Group does not currently hold any fair value hedging instruments such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps.
Surplus funds are placed on short term fixed rate deposit and as such also give rise to interest rate exposure.
There was no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates at the year end.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on managing liquidity risk throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with lenders.
Overdraft and revolving credit facilities provide short term flexibility whilst the revolving credit facilities provide longer term committed funding.
As shown in note 17, at 31 December 2015 undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 122.7m 2014: 102.7m were available to the Group in various currencies.
At an operating level, the Group has a positive cash flow from operating activities and where practical the funds generated by business units are managed on a regional basis.
In the UK and US, most business units utilise local bank facilities within a UK or USA group arrangement.
This allows a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups borrowings and other financial liabilities, including derivative financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.
The difference between the contractual cash flows and the carrying amount of these liabilities reflects the effects of interest not included in the carrying amount and discounting applied in assessing fair value.
com Cobham plc 109 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk related to liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a range ofreputable financial institutions.
The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Groups ongoing risk management processes, which include a regular review of the banks credit ratings.
Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level for term deposits with any one counterparty.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables shown in note 15.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2015, 9.6% 2014: 9.2% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2015 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 15.
Bank term balances totalling 6.1m 2014: 6.2m have been pledged against the residual value of leased assets under an agreement which expires in 2020.
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business, these bank accounts are settled ona net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the Balance Sheet as shown in note 14.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event, the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Derivatives can also be offset by counterparties in the event of a default: net amounts that result on this basis are shown in note 14.
Inflation risk The Groups exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity.
The Group has one swap contract which was designed to manage the inherent inflation risk in a specific operational contract.
The fair value of this swap contract is included in derivative financial instruments shown in note 21.
Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain stakeholder confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Capital is defined as total equity excluding non-controlling interests and amounted to 908.8m at 31 December 2015 2014: 1,111.4m.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an appropriate finance structure through a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition or business divestment is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions and proposed dividend levels.
Group banking arrangements are also considered: these include financial covenants which are based on adjusted IFRS results as outlined on page 29.
This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to beconsidered appropriate.

The hedge reserve reflects movements in fair values on cash flow hedging derivatives as detailed in notes 21 and 23.
The share based payment reserve includes the cost of awards as assessed under IFRS 2 and detailed in note 26, together with related deferred tax provided under IAS 12.
The appropriate proportion of this reserve is transferred to retained earnings following vesting or exercise.
Share based payments The Group offers a number of long term incentive schemes which provide a mix of performance based incentive and retention based awards as described below and in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 63.
All schemes are equity settled and the total amount included in the Income Statement arising from share based payment schemes is as follows: m 2015 2014 PSP 2.1 6.8 RSP 1.3 0.7 Other schemes 0.7 0.7 Release of amounts charged in previous years 7.1 2.1 3.0 6.1 During the year ended 31 December 2015, 7.1m 2014: 2.1m charged to the Income Statement in previous years has been released, reflecting actual vesting experience and a reassessment of the expected future vesting of outstanding awards, based on non-market related performance conditions.
The PSP scheme is offered to senior executives across the Group and allows for annual grants of conditional shares and nil-cost options with vesting conditions based on the Groups financial performance, taking into account both market based conditions such as TSR growth and non-market based measures such as EPS growth or cash conversion respectively.
The scheme includes retention awards granted during 2014 and buy-out awards granted to key new starters, both vesting after a maximum of three years conditional only upon continued employment within the Group.
RSP awards provide conditional shares based solely on continued employment within the Group.
Awards vest either in full after three years, or over a four year period, with 25% vesting on each anniversary.
In previous years, share options were awarded to senior executives under the ESOS and BCP schemes.
No new awards have been made under the ESOS since 2013.
The BCP provided matching shares where bonus awards were invested in shares and was last awarded in 2014, only to the Group CEO.
The Groups ShareSave scheme is open to all UK employees.

Fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model modified by a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the likely impact of market related performance conditions.
The weighted average inputs into the models were as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted average share price 3.058 3.065 Expected life 2.98 years 2.82 years Expected employee cancellation rate 4.4% 4.1% Risk free rate 0.6% 0.9% The expected lives used in the models have been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability and behavioural considerations.
The expected employee cancellation rates are based on assessments of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of contracts by employees.
Most participants of the PSP schemes receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the valuation models.
The fair values of ESOS and ShareSave awards are significantly lower than for PSP, RSP and BCP awards due to the effect of the exercise price which is set based upon the market value of the Companys ordinary shares around the date of grant.
27. Business combinations prior year restatement In the Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition of the Aeroflex businesses were marked as provisional.

Operating lease arrangements At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: m 2015 2014 Within one year 27.7 41.8 Between one and two years 24.9 24.0 Between two and three years 23.0 23.3 Between three and four years 20.9 20.1 Between four and five years 14.8 16.2 After five years 61.1 53.6 172.4 179.0 Operating lease payments during the year totalled 30.1m 2014: 27.3m including rental costs of 7.5m 2014: 6.9m relating to operational aircraft used in its service businesses: the remainder primarily relates to the rental of office and operating facilities.
Operating lease commitments include 20.0m 2014: 12.0m related to onerous leases which have been provided for at the balance sheet date.
Contingent liabilities At 31 December 2015, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group Financial Statements.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims and management do not anticipate that the outcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
As previously notified, the Group identified one, more significant, contractual breach dating back some years, in respect of goods provided into a geographic market representing only a small amount of revenue for the Group.
The circumstances surrounding the breach remain under review and neither the outcome nor timing of resolution can be estimated.
No further information is disclosed as it could be prejudicial.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business, whose resolution is uncertain and could materially impact the Groups future reported earnings.
In particular, on fixed price development contracts, costs incurred and anticipated can significantly exceed amounts estimated at inception as a result of material enhancements to the specifications originally agreed under the contracts.
Judgement is therefore required as regards the final costs of technical solutions, the outcome of negotiations with customers and the amounts recoverable under these contracts.
The Directors take account of the advice of experts in making these judgements and believe that the outcome of negotiations will result in an appropriate recovery of costs incurred in excess of original baselines.
Related party transactions There were no material transactions between Group entities and joint ventures and associates during the current or previous year other than 0.5m 2014: 1.0m of goods purchased from related parties.
Group policy is for all sales of goods to related parties to be made on an arms length basis and no guarantees have been given to, or received from, related parties.
No expense has been recognised for bad or doubtful debts in respect of amounts owed by related parties.
Details of the compensation of key management personnel the Group Executive Committee as referred to on page 48 can be found in note 4.
The Directors of Cobham plc had no material transactions with the Company during the year, other than as a result of service agreements.
Details of Directors remuneration are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 66.
