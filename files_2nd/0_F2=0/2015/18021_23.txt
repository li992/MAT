com 115 Notes to the accounts continued 16 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED At 31 December 2015, the Group was contractually committed to 162.5 million 2014: 100.9 million of future expenditure for the purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property.
Refer to note 34 Capital Commitments for further information on capital commitments.
The fair value of the Groups investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2015 was determined by independent, appropriately qualified external valuers, Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties excluding the Empress State Building and Venues: and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Groups property portfolio.
The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
Each year the Managing Directors, on behalf of the Board, appoints the external valuers.
The valuers are selected based upon their knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group.
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Groups portfolio.
At each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs.
Valuers submit and present summary reports to the Groups Audit Committee, with the Managing Directors reporting to the Board on the outcome of each valuation round.
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition.
The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs for example Section 106, professional fees, planning fees, developers profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at its valuation.
A number of the Groups properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the development.
Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developers profit before arriving at a valuation.
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties, the Empress State Building has been valued on the basis of its development potential as a residential led scheme.
The property is currently used as an office space, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to achieve the change in use is being implemented.
Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have also been valued on the basis of their development potential, principally for the conversion to residential use or for improving the configuration of retail units.
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.
The most significant of these occur when planning permission is required or when a credit facility is in place.
These restrictions are factored into the propertys valuation by the external valuer.
Refer to disclosures surrounding property risks on page 17.
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13.
Trading property is exempted from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements.
The different valuation levels are defined as: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets: Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices: and Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.
Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from Level 3 to Level 2.
All investment and development property held by the Group are classified as Level 3.

The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Groups operations: market risk principally interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.

The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint ventures.
The table is disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
Fixed Capped Floating Fixed Capped Floating 2015 2015 2014 2014 m m m m 1 Nominal value of Group borrowings excluding finance leases 150.0 472.5 150.0 298.5 Nominal value of joint venture borrowings excluding finance leases 43.8 6.9 150.0 516.3 150.0 305.4 Derivative impact nominal value of derivative contracts 453.0 453.0 276.8 276.8 Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 603.0 63.3 426.8 28.6 Interest rate protection 91% 94% 1 Excludes current loan notes of 6.0 million to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing.
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is greater than 25 per cent.
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective at 31 December 2015 was 2.2 per cent 2014: 2.2 per cent.
Cash flow hedge: In 2014, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising on 50 million of outstanding debt from 2014 to 2024.
The gain recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was nil 2014: 0.3 million.
This gain will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the designated debt.
The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2015 was nil 2014: nil.
The hedge was 100 per cent effective: therefore no charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement during the year.
com 125 Notes to the accounts continued 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The sensitivity analysis below illustrates the impact of a 50 basis point bp shift, upwards and downwards, in the level of interest rates on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Increase in interest Decrease in interest Increase in interest Decrease in interest rates by 50 bp rates by 50 bp rates by 50 bp rates by 50 bp 2015 2015 2014 2014 m m m m Effect on profit before tax: Decrease Increase 5.1 5.1 6.9 6.9 The sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed and undrawn facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entitys ability to meet the relevant facilitys financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
This was the strategy employed in the refinancing of existing borrowings in 2014.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from joint ventures, loan notes and cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any deposits or guarantees obtained.
126 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Trade and other receivables: Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Trade receivables are less than 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2015 2014: Less than 1 per cent and no one tenant accounts for more than 10 per cent of rental income.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2015 was 7.3 million 2014: 5.9 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
In relation to the Groups exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full.
Additionally, specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2015 2014 m m Up to 90 days 6.6 7.9 Over 90 days 0.2 Trade receivables 6.6 8.1 In 2015 there was an impairment write down on trade receivables of 0.1 million 2014: write back of 0.4 million.
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the extensive range of tenants from varying business sectors and the credit review process as noted above.
Amounts receivable from joint ventures: Included within receivables is 10.0 million 2014: 19.1 million of amounts advanced to LSJV.
The carrying value of the investment in LSJV is nil 2014: nil as the Groups share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment.
Total funding advanced to LSJV of 41.5 million 2014: 38.3 million has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture, 31.5 million 2014: 19.2 million.
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and market value.
However based on a market valuation undertaken by the Groups valuers Jones Lang LaSalle, there is an unrecognised surplus of 91.6 million Group share as at 31 December 2015.
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when building work is physically complete.
Therefore, while Lillie Square demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default, for reporting purposes the Group is required to impair amounts advanced to LSJV until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale.
Loan notes: At 31 December 2015, included within receivables were nil 2014: 6.2 million of loan notes that related to the disposal of a subsidiary in 2008.
The loan notes were settled on 19 June 2015 for 6.3 million.
After selling costs a loss of 0.2 million was incurred as a result of the transaction.
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments: The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between Aand A.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.

The Group aims not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These ratios are disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis excluding the non-controlling interest share of net debt and property in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
These metrics are discussed in the Financial Review on pages 40 to 45.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13.
The different valuation levels are defined in note 16 Property Portfolio.
The tables below present the Groups financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.

29 DEFERRED TAX The decrease in corporation tax rate referred to in note 12 Taxation has been substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 and therefore has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of the realisation of deferred tax.
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the properties original tax base cost.
Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Groups holding structure.
The Groups recognised deferred tax liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is 15.6 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 11.8 million.
The Groups contingent tax liability on investment properties, calculated on the same tax base cost as above but based on a deemed market value disposal at year-end, is 17.6 million 2014: nil.
The variance between the two methods of calculation arise from the differing tax rates applicable at the time of each deemed disposal.
A disposal of the Groups trading properties including Lillie Square at their market value as per note 16 Property Portfolio would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 20.2 million 20.25 per cent of 99.9 million.

In May 2014 the Company completed a placing of 75,900,000 new ordinary shares of 25 pence each aggregate nominal value 18.9 million at a price of 340 pence per share to UK and South African institutions.
The placing generated gross proceeds of 258.1 million, 251.7 million net of expenses.
The terms of the placing were fixed on 14 May 2014.
The market price of the Companys shares on 14 May 2014 was 344.2 pence per share.
Aggregate market price of placing shares on 14 May 2014 was 261.2 million.

As the transaction price of the loan notes was not an approximation of their fair value, the Group determined the fair value by using data from observable inputs.
As a result, the initial fair value of the loan notes was valued at less than 0.1 million and therefore 398.3 million has been classified as equity.

40 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives.
All schemes are equity settled with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of the Groups equity instruments at the grant date of the share awards.
The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based payments for 2015 was 4.6 million 2014: 4.8 million.
Reconciliations of movements in share incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 134 to 136 1.
Performance share plan Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the Group Performance Share Plan PSP.
Exercise at the vesting date is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee at the time of grant.
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: the Groups Total Return TR over three consecutive financial years the TR Performance Period relative to the median of the TRs over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc the Comparator Group : and the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a period of three years the TSR Performance Period relative to the median of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group.
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance period.
In calculating TR for a company which is not a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back.
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in ordinary shares.
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 71, 80 and 81.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group whether to replace a removed member or otherwise if it believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group.
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
In general, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC as a Company Share Option Plan CSOP scheme: therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as approved options.
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2015 were exercisable between nil pence and 402.9 pence and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2016 and 2025. a Market value option awards 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average market value exercise price market value exercise price options pence options pence Outstanding at 1 January 2,380,640 122.1 5,239,909 124.6 Awarded during the year 776,447 402.9 Forfeited during the year 102,202 402.9 56,944 176.3 1 Exercised during the year 1,680,137 112.1 2,802,325 125.7 Outstanding at 31 December 1,374,748 272.1 2,380,640 122.1 Exercisable at 31 December 689,907 2,369,451 1 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 399.8 pence 2014: 338.5 pence.

Matching share plan Under the Group Matching Share Plan MSP, deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus.
These awards may also be made as nil cost options.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award.
Awards of nil cost options were made in both the current and comparative periods.
The fair value of share awards is determined by the market price of the shares at the grant date.

The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred.
In exceptional circumstances the matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred.
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions.
Vesting of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally determined.
The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Matching nil cost options and share awards generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased or deferred shares.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the MSP was 1.9 million 2014: 2.1 million.

Fair value of share-based payment As stated above, one half of each award granted is subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of share awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the half that is subject to the TR performance condition and using the stochastic pricing model for the half that is subject to the TSR performance condition.
Inputs to the models for share awards during the year are as follows: Year of share award 2015 2014 2013 2012 Closing share price at grant date 404p 320 350p 271p 196p Exercise price 403p 0 268p Expected option life 3 years 3 years 3 years 5 years Risk-free rate 0.5 to 1.2% 1.1 1.2% 0.24% 0.37% Expected volatility 19.0 to 22.0% 20.6 22.2% 21.7% 27% 1 Expected dividend yield 0.4% 0.4 0.5% 0.5% 0.8% Average share price 421p 344p 308p 208p Value per option 36 167p 82 126p 23 134p 85p 1 Expected dividend yield is based on public pronouncements about future dividend levels: all other measures are based on historical data.

Current pension arrangements The Venues business has a hybrid pension scheme comprising a money purchase section that was closed on 28 February 2014 and a final salary section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011.
The final salary section is a funded defined benefit scheme the Scheme which is contracted out of State Second Pension.
On closure of the money purchase section of the Venues pension scheme, a defined contribution group personal pension plan was offered to eligible Venues employees.
The Groups current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements.
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: Investment risk the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficit emerges.
Interest rate risk the Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
Inflation risk a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long-term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
Mortality risk in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.

As a result, a discount rate of 3.7 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2015 2014: 3.4 per cent.
This is higher than the rate used in the prior year given the changes to the yields on bonds over the current year.
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from time to time to reflect current trends.
The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA, CMI 150%, and Year of Birth.
The table below makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each member.

42 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD On 8 January 2016, the 665 million Covent Garden revolving credit facility was replaced by a new 705 million revolving credit facility.
This new facility is repayable in December 2020 which on a pro-forma basis has extended the weighted average debt maturity to 5.3 years, has reduced the weighted average cost of debt to 2.8 per cent and has increased available facilities by 40 million.
The Group has incurred a charge of approximately 2.7 million relating to fees on the new facility and has written off 5.2 million relating to unamortised fees on the existing facility.
