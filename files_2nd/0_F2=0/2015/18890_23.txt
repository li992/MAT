There are legal claims against the Company or its subsidiary undertakings but none where the Board takes the view that it is likely that damages will be awarded against the Group which would have a materially adverse effect on its financial position.
34 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Explanatory note: The Group operates a number of schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
Details of the schemes are included below.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
PENSION AND SEVERANCE SCHEMES Approximately 300 employees 2014, 250 are members of five different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,400 2014, 1,400 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were 0.6m 2014, 0.6m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2015, at their market value, is estimated at 106.0m 2014,118.5m and the liabilities estimated at 99.0m 2014, 115.4m.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contributions.
The resultant aggregate net pension asset under IAS 19 is 1.4m 2014,1.7m liability.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SCHEMES UK In the UK, the Group supports the Laird Pension Scheme which is a funded arrangement providing defined benefits on a final salary basis.
The Group also operates an unapproved arrangement which provides unfunded defined benefits on a final salary basis to certain members who were previously subject to the HMRC pension schemes earnings cap.
Both of the UK arrangements are closed to new entrants.
The Laird Pension Scheme makes up approximately 87% of the defined benefit liabilities of the Group.
The Laird Pension Scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustee on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The scheme is subject to the scheme specific funding requirements as outlined in UK legislation.
The most recent scheme specific funding valuation was at 1 January 2015.
The Laird Pension Schemes investment strategy is to invest 25% in return-seeking assets and 75% in bonds and annuities.
This strategy reflects the schemes liability profile whilst aiming to minimise long term costs by maximising return.
The schemes assets are held separately from those of the Group.
LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 142 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2015 34 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Belgium In Belgium, the Group operates the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan which is a funded, insured lump sum defined benefit scheme and the Emerson and Cuming Pre-Pension Plan which is an unfunded plan where the employer pays a monthly indemnity until the retirement date on top of the unemployment allowances paid by the social security.
Germany In Germany, the Group operates the Cattron-Theimeg Europe GmbH & Co. KG Pension Plan.
This is a funded defined benefit scheme currently providing pension benefits to 7 pensioners 2014, 7.
Sweden Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme included within a multi-employer plan for its employees which is insured with Alecta.
This scheme is a defined benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Groups proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the scheme.
Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Groups proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme.
As a result, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme, although it is actually a defined benefit scheme.
Korea Within Korea, the Group operates the Model Solution severance scheme under Korean Labour law.
This provides a payment to an employee in the event their service is terminated, if they resign or if they retire.
On any of these events, employees will receive a lump sum approximately equal to one month of salary for each year of service.
The scheme is partially funded to a level of 70% by law at least 60% of the accrued liabilities must be funded.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the non UK plans reflect their local environments.
IAS19 requires that the discount rate is set according to the level of market yields on either corporate or government bonds in the relevant markets.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension assets and liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows: 2015 2014 Schemes Schemes in surplus in surplus with a with a right to a Other right to a Other refund schemes Total refund schemes Total m m m m m m Annuities 6.2 6.2 7.0 7.0 Equities UK 2.4 2.4 Overseas 22.6 22.6 26.7 26.7 Gilts and bonds Government backed 56.4 56.4 61.0 61.0 Investment grade corporate bonds 16.7 16.7 17.3 17.3 Other including cash 0.5 3.5 4.0 0.5 3.6 4.1 Total market value of assets 102.4 3.5 105.9 114.9 3.6 118.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 86.3 12.7 99.0 101.2 14.2 115.4 Funded status 16.1 9.2 6.9 13.7 10.6 3.1 Disallowed assets 5.6 5.6 4.8 4.8 Surplus deficit in the schemes 10.5 9.2 1.3 8.9 10.6 1.7 LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 143 34 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The mortality assumption used at the 2015 year end and 2014 year end is based on the SAPS all lives tables with a 90% multiplier for Executives and Directors and 110% for all other members, appropriate for each members year of birth.
Allowance is made for improvements in line with CMI 2014 projections with a 1.5% pa long term trend from 2002.
The expected lifetime of a participant at 31 December 2015 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these mortality tables: Executive and Other members directormembers Age Males Females Males Females 65 21.9 24.2 23.5 25.8 65 in 15 years 23.4 25.9 25.1 27.6 For IAS 19 the schemes liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 3.2% per annum 2014, 3.2%, salary increases of 3.2% 4.2% per annum 2014, 4.2% 5.2% and a discount rate for liabilities of 3.7% per annum 2014, 3.6%.

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS Over the year to 31 December 2016 the Group is expected to contribute 34.4% of pensionable salaries in respect of Ordinary Section members and 62.8% of pensionable salaries in respect of Executive Section members of the Laird Pension Scheme.
In addition, the Group will meet the cost of Pension Protection Levies, death in service premiums and other administration expenses associated with the Laird Pension Scheme.
The Group is expected to make contributions of approximately 0.1m to the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan and 0.1m to the Swedish scheme insured with Alecta.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to the defined benefit schemes will be 0.7m in 2016.
The average duration of the liabilities of the Laird Pension Scheme is approximately 16 years.
KEY RISKS The ultimate cost of the schemes to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made.
Many of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the schemes may be higher or lower than disclosed.
In general, the risk to the Group is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the calculation of contribution requirements are not borne out in practice and the cost to the Group is higher than expected.
More specifically, some of the significant risks are detailed below: Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields whereas the schemes hold a mixture of investments: if assets underperform the corporate bond yield, this may create a deficit.
Inflation risk: The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
Changes in corporate bond yields: A fall in corporate bond yields will lead to an increase in liabilities.
This will be only partially offset by an increase in the value of the corporate bonds held by the schemes.
LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 145 34 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The results in these disclosures are inherently volatile, particularly the figures shown on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the approximate sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in assumptions to illustrate this volatility.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 6.5m Inflation Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 3.5m Increase by 0.5% Increase by 3.5m Assumed life expectancy at age 65 0.25% reduction in the long term Decrease by 1.0m trend of 1.5% to 1.25% METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivity analysis shown above has been calculated based on approximate adjustments to the scheme liabilities using a consistent methodology with that used to calculate the liabilities.
The impact on the liabilities has been rounded to the nearest 0.5m.
The sensitivity analysis to price inflation includes the impact of a change in both Retail Price Inflation and Consumer Price Inflation, as well as those assumptions which are derived relative to these measures salary increase, revaluation of deferredpensions and increases to pensions in payment.
For this purpose it has been assumed that the differences between RPI CPI and these related assumptions remains the same unless there are any caps or floors on the pension increases, in which case these have been applied.
35 POST BALANCE SHEET On 20 January 2016, the Group acquired Novero, a Germany based provider of integrated vehicles connectivity systems for a total consideration of 65m.
The consideration was satisfied through a share issue valued at 15.5m with the balance paid in cash.
Book and fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities of Novero have not been provided because the accounting is not yet complete in the time available post acquisition.

The Company is a public limited company, is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
No profit and loss account has been presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The results of the Company are included in the preceding Group financial statements.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP for all periods presented.
Note 17 contains detail of all transition adjustments.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: The requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements in respect of paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: paragraph 73 e of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible Assets: and the requirement of paragraph 134 in respect of capital disclosures: The requirement of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: The requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18 a of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: The requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member: The requirements of IAS 8 Standards Issued But Not Effective: The requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments: and The requirements of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of Financial Reporting Standards paragraphs 6 to 21 to present an opening statement of financial position at transition.
JUDGEMENT AND KEY SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTIES Share based payments Estimating fair value for share based transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model which depends on the terms and condition of the grant.
This estimation also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option or appreciation right, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 149 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS Plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: Computer equipment 5 years or less Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted inanactive market.
PENSIONS Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the income statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate.
The Company applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Company to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
INVESTMENTS Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
DIVIDENDS Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of the Company.
LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 150 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PARENT COMPANY CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2015 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, or to receive more tax subject to the following: a Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date.
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not recognised.
b Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
c Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
FINANCIAL ASSETS Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost.
Provisions are made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, inclusive of any transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss account.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
PROVISIONS These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 151 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED TREASURY SHARES The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird PLC Employee Benefit Trust the EBT Trust are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13 these are Level 2 derivative financial instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the profit and loss account.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Medium Term Incentive Plan MTIP and Restricted Share Plan RSP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP, MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market company performance and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.. LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 152 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PARENT COMPANY CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2015 2 DIVIDENDS PAID AND PROPOSED On 1 March 2016 the Board declared, subject to approval from shareholders, a final dividend of 8.6p per share 2014, 8.23p.

The forward contracts have a principal value of 30.6m 2014, 120.8m and are mainly denominated in US Dollar and Chinese Renminbi.
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the decrease in fair value during 2015 of 0.5m 2014,2.5m decrease has been taken to the income statement.
These are Level 2 derivative financial instruments and there has been no movement between levels during the year.
Interest rate and currency profile The Companys policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs.
At 31 December 2015 approximately 44% 2014, 49% of debt is at fixed rate.
This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Companys equity.
The interest rates considered are Sterling, Euro and US Dollar, being the currencies in which the Company has historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes those recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative floating rate financial instruments.
Effect on profit before tax m 2015 50 basis points increase in US Dollar interest rates 0.7 50 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 0.0 50 basis points increase in Euro interest rates 0.1 A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
2014 50 basis points increase in US Dollar interest rates 0.5 50 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 0.0 50 basis points increase in Euro interest rates 0.1 A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
Credit risk The Companys customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal products with customers who themselves have significant market shares.
Inevitably this results in levels of business and trade receivables that are material in the overall Company context.
The Companys maximum exposure tocredit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
LAIRD PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 158 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PARENT COMPANY CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2015 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollar, Euro and Renminbi.
The Company policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then hedge out the residual exposures.
The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts and the Companys equity due to changes in the fair value offorward currency hedges and net investment hedges.
Effect on profit Effect before tax on equity m m 2015 10% appreciation of the US Dollar 9.7 23.6 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.9 2.6 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 1.5 2014 10% appreciation of the US Dollar 9.3 18.9 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.3 2.7 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 1.1 A 10% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
Net investment hedging Included in borrowings are US $349.5m 237.1m and 35.0m 25.8m of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States and Europe subsidiaries.
This is being used to hedge the Companys exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The Companys financial policy is to maintain committed borrowing facilities, which provide substantial headroom over and above its day-to-day borrowing requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December were as follows: 2015 2014 m m Expiring between two and three years Expiring between four and five years 103.5 139.6 Loan covenants The principal covenants in the Companys committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net borrowings are set out below: Interest cover The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation EBITA to be not less than 3.0 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Company was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2015.
Fair value of financial instruments The US Private Placement loans with a book value of 111.5m 2014, 106.8m have an estimated fair value of 112.0m 2014, 110.2m which has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2015.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.
