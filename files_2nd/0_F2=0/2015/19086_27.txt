110 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Mitchells & Butlers plc Company financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements comply with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
No statement of recognised gains and losses is provided as the only additional loss is the actuarial movement which is disclosed in note 10.
The Companys accounting policies have been applied on a consistent basis with no changes to policies during the period.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with FRS 26, the Company applies fair value accounting in order to hedge part of its euro loan with Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH against part of its investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation on both of these items using the period end rate are taken to the profit and loss account.

Cash flow statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements and not produced a cash flow statement.

Profit and loss account The Company recorded a profit after tax of 68m 2014 94m, less dividends of nil 2014 nil.
Auditors remuneration for audit services to the Company was 22,000 2014 22,000.
This is borne by another Group company, as are any other costs relating to non-audit services see note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements.
Employees and Directors 2015 2014 52 weeks 52 weeks Average number of employees, including part-time employees 2 2 Employees of Mitchells & Butlers plc consist of Executive Directors.
Pensions Accounting policy The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
The Company accounts for pensions under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Prior to the introduction of IAS 19 revised, disclosure requirements under FRS 17 were equivalent to those under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
However, following Group adoption of IAS 19 revised on 29 September 2013, differences in the accounting and disclosure requirements between FRS 17 and IAS 19 revised now arise.
The actuarial liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Companys defined benefit arrangements is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets, shown net of deferred tax.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified independent actuaries.
Following guidance from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the total liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Companys defined benefit arrangements is the greater of the minimum funding requirements, calculated as the present value of the agreed schedule of contributions, and the actuarial calculated liability.
There is no current service cost as all defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount within finance income or expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Companys defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the Companys defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable.
Strategicreport 233 Governance 3469 Financialstatements 70115  116 111 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Pension liability The net pension liability of 280m 2014 340m is shown net of a deferred tax asset of 70m 2014 85m.
The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Groups pension plans.
Information concerning the pension scheme arrangements operated by the Company and associated current and future contributions is contained within note 4.5 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 101 to 103.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities Minimum funding requirements The results of the 2013 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of 572m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by FRS 17 and on 21 May 2014 the Company formally agreed a new 10 year recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities.
The Group has agreed to increase contributions from 40m to 45m per annum, for three years effective from 1 April 2013.
From 1 April 2016 contributions then increase each year by the rate of RPI capped between 0% to 5% for the following seven years.
As part of the recovery plan, the Group has also made a further payment of 40m in September 2015 on terms agreed with the Trustees.
An additional liability is recognised, such that the overall pension liability at the period end reflects the schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement, should this be higher than the actuarial deficit.
Actuarial valuation The actuarial valuations used for IAS 19 revised purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2013 and updated by the schemes independent qualified actuaries to 26 September 2015.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 26 September 2015 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
FRS 17 requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high quality corporate bonds.
The principal financial assumptions used at the balance sheet date have been updated to reflect changes in market conditions in the period and mortality assumptions are in line with those used in the 2013 actuarial valuation as agreed on 21 May 2014.
These assumptions and a sensitivity analysis are disclosed in note 4.5 to the Group consolidated financial statements on page 102.
The long-term rates of return on assets at 26 September 2015 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension scheme assets for the 2016 financial year.
The 2014 rates shown are used in calculating the 2015 expected return.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily Government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 4.2% 2014 4.7%.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the period was 7.4% 2014 9.5%, which represented a gain of 131m 2014 154m.
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2015 2014 m m Fair value of assets 2,010 1,865 Present value of scheme liabilities 2,112 2,058 Actuarial deficit in the schemes 102 193 Additional liability recognised due to minimum funding requirements 248 232 Total pension liability 350 425 Associated deferred tax asset 70 85 Net pension liability 280 340 The following amounts relating to the defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Companys financial statements in the period: Profit and loss account 2015 2014 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Interest received: Expected return on pension scheme assets 78 81 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 77 80 Net interest in respect of pensions 1 1 Profit and loss account reserves 2015 2014 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 54 73 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 50 199 Actuarial gain loss recognised 4 126 Movement in pension liability recognised due to minimum funding requirements 16 101 Total movement in pension liability recognised reserves 12 227 112 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Mitchells & Butlers plc Company financial statements continued 4.

The defined benefit obligation comprises 25m 2014 24m relating to the MABETUS unfunded plan and 2,087m 2014 2,034m relating to the funded plans.
Share-based payments Accounting policy The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non marketbased vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is generally recognised over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect, on the number of shares that will eventually vest, of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures due to employees leaving the employment of the Company.
Fair values are calculated using either the Black-Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
Schemes in operation The charge recognised for share-based payments in the period is nil 2014 nil which comprises share option schemes and share awards to the employees of the Company.
Details of employee share schemes and options granted over the shares of the Company are included under note 4.6 of the consolidated financial statements.

Taxation Accounting policies Current taxation The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, subject to certain exceptions, in respect of all material timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax asset Movements in the deferred tax asset can be analysed as follows: m At 28 September 2013 50 Charged to profit and loss account 10 Credited to profit and loss account reserves 45 At 27 September 2014 85 Charged to profit and loss account 17 Credited to profit and loss account reserves 2 At 26 September 2015 70 Analysed as tax timing differences related to: 2015 2014 m m Pensions 70 85 The pension liability is shown net of the associated deferred tax asset see note 4.
