Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 18 Capital management continued In order to manage its cost of capital, maintain an appropriate capital structure and meet its ongoing cash flow needs, the Group may issue new debt instruments, adjust the level of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares to, or repurchase shares from, investors or dispose of assets to reduce its net debt exposure.
The Group operates a DLC structure which has been agreed with the South African Ministry of Finance and is subject to certain exchange control conditions.
The exchange control conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to optimally manage its capital structure.
However, they do require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc be constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism, which serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
The Group has continually met the exchange control provisions in the past and management is committed to ensuring that the Group continues to meet these provisions in future.
