Babcock International Group PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2015 186 186 Babcock International Group PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company are disclosed below: Basis of accounting The Companys financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and in compliance with the Companies Act 2006 and on a going concern basis.
The Directors have reviewed the Companys existing accounting policies and consider that they are consistent with last year.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis.
Taxation Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Finance costs Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Employee benefits a Share-based compensation The Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award and recharged to subsidiaries.
Full details of the share-based compensation plans are disclosed in note 26 of the Group financial statements.
b Treasury shares The shares purchased by the Companys ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity.
Refer to the Group financial statements note 25 for further details.
c Pension arrangement The Company operates a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme is accounted for on a defined contribution basis as the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
There is no material difference between the FRS 17 as amended : Retirement Benefits and IAS 19: Employee Benefits valuation.
Refer to the Group financial statements note 26 for further details.
As a result of the level of surplus the Companys compulsory contribution to the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme is currently suspended until at least the results of the next formal valuation are available although voluntary contributions have been made see note 26 of the Group financial statements.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The Company designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Financial risk management All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counterparties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the Companys financial statements in the period in which they are approved and in the case of interims, when paid.
