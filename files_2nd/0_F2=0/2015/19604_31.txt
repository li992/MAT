This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure: exceptional items, including income and expenditure relating to material litigation in respect of products no longer in production: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in a business combination the charge is a non-cash item, and the directors believe that it should be added back to give a clearer picture of underlying performance: other financing gains and losses, which represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments which are not hedge accounted under IAS 39: and scheme administration costs, financing credits and charges relating to retirement benefits.
The excluded items are referred to as non-headline items.

The Fuel for Growth programme, which involves redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, is considered exceptional by virtue of its size and impact on the Groups operations.
Gains of 14m on changes to post-retirement benefits arise from a settlement offer by the US defined benefit pension plans allowing deferred members a one-off option to elect to cash out their retirement entitlements rather than receive a pension at retirement which wascompleted in September 2014 see note 9.
A charge of 8m has been made by Titeflex Corporation in respect of changes to the estimated cost of future claims including those from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strike.
The charge comprises 7m in respect of movements in the gross provision and 1m relating to changes in discounting.
The operating charge in respect of John Crane, Inc. litigation comprises 14m in respect of increased provision for adverse judgments and legal defence costs, 4m in respect of litigation management and legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers, and 1m arising from the decrease in US risk-free rates.
The final resolution of items previously reported as exceptional has been reported as exceptional because the earlier transactions were treated as exceptional items.
The litigation provisions for Titeflex Corporation and John Crane, Inc. and the commutation of insurance policies received by John Crane, Inc. were reported as exceptional in the year of recognition.
Consequently, the ongoing adjustments to these provisions are reported as exceptional items.
Year ended 31 July 2014 Restructuring costs included a final charge of 3m in respect of the Smiths Detection improvement programme and 26m in respect of Fuelfor Growth.
These programmes, which involve redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, are considered exceptional byvirtue of their size.
Profit on disposals includes the expiry of certain warranties on the disposal of Cross Match Technologies, Inc. which has generated an additional profit of 3m.
A charge of 10m was recognised by Titeflex Corporation.
This reflected costs which are not expected to recur associated with one anomalous case which was settled during the year together with the estimated cost of future claims including those from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strike, net of small gains relating to changes in discounting.
The operating charge in respect of John Crane, Inc. litigation comprised 49m in respect of increased provision for adverse judgments andlegal defence costs, 1m in respect of legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers, less 2m arising from changes in US risk-free rates.
The increase in the provision reflected two large historical judgments which were settled in the year.

This note only provides information about corporate income taxes under IFRS.
Smiths companies operate in over 50 countries across the world.
They pay and collect many different taxes in addition to corporate income taxes including: payroll taxes: value added and sales taxes: property taxes: product-specific taxes and environmental taxes.
Thecostsassociated with these other taxes are included in profit before tax.

This includes defined benefit and defined contribution plans and, mainly in the United Kingdom UK and United States of America US, post-retirement healthcare.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans across many countries.
In the UK a defined contribution plan has been offered since the closure of the UK defined benefit pension plans.
In the US a 401k defined contribution plan operates.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of all these plans was 28m 2014: 30m.
Defined benefit and post-retirement healthcare plans The principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and in the US and these have been closed so that no future benefits are accrued.
For all schemes, pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2015.
Schemeassets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries.

Scheme trustees need to obtain regular actuarial valuations to assess the scheme against this funding objective.
The trustees and sponsoring companies need to agree funding plans to improve the position of a scheme, when it is below the acceptable funding level.
The UK Pensions Regulator has extensive powers to protect the benefits of members, promote good administration and reduce the risk of situations arising which may require compensation to be paid from the Pension Protection Fund.
These powers include imposing a schedule of contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions, where a trustee and company fail to agree appropriate calculations.
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009.
SIPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at date of closure.
SIPS is governed by a corporate trustee SI Trustee Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths Group plc.
The board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent chairman selected by Smiths Group plc.
Trustee Directors are responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme is being performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2015, and experience gains and losses identified during this valuation have been incorporated into the IAS 19 valuation.
Under the current funding plan for SIPS Smiths pays cash contributions of 3m a month until October 2019.
In addition, Smiths invests 2m a month in index-linked gilts held in an escrow account.
The escrow account remains an asset of the Group until 2020, see note 17.
At that time, the assets in escrow will be allocated subject to the funding position of SIPS.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening funding valuation.
SIPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
It is not yet possible to reliably quantify the impact of this adjustment.
The liability for Barber equalisation has been recognised, increasing the deficit at31 July 2015 by 1m.
The duration of the SIPS liabilities is around 23 years 2014: 23 years for active deferred members, 23 years 2014: 23 years for deferred members and 12 years 2014: 11 years for pensioners and dependants.
TI Group Pension Scheme TIGPS This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009.
TIGPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at the date of closure.
TIGPS is governed by a corporate trustee TI Pension Trustee Limited, an independent company.
The board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent trustee director selected by the Trustee.
The Trustee is responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme is being performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 5 April 2015.
Under the current funding plan for TIGPS Smiths pays cash contributions of 16m a year until April 2016.
148 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 9 Post-retirement benefits continued Defined benefit and post-retirement healthcare plans continued UK pension schemes continued TI Group Pension Scheme TIGPS continued Under the governing documentation of the TIGPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme.
If TIGPS was wound up while it had members, the scheme would need to buy out the benefits of all members.
The buyouts would cost significantly more than the present value of the scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19 revised.
TIGPS is compliant with all identified requirements of Barber equalisation.
TIGPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
The duration of the TIGPS liabilities is around 21 years 2014: 23 years for active deferred members, 19 years 2014: 20 years for deferred members and 11 years 2014:10 years for pensioners and dependants.
US pension plans The most recent valuations of the six principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2014.
The pension plans were closed with effect from 30 April 2009 and benefits were calculated as at that date and are not revalued.
Governance of the US pension plans is managed by a Settlor Committee appointed by Smiths Group Services Corp.
The US pension plans offered deferred members a one-off option to elect to cash out their retirement entitlements rather than receive a pension at retirement.
Lump sum payments of $150m were made in August and September 2014.
This programme generated a settlement gain of 14m.
The duration of the liabilities for the largest US plan is around 14 years 2014: 18 years for active deferred members, 19 years 2014: 19 years for deferred members and 10 years 2014: 9 years for pensioners and dependants.
On 14 August 2015 the US funded plans completed a buy-out of retiree liabilities for $527m, transferring the obligation to pay pensions toVoya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company.
Risk management The pensions schemes are exposed to risks that: investment returns are below expectations, leaving the scheme with insufficient assets in future to pay all its pension obligations: members and dependants live longer than expected, increasing the value of the pensions the scheme has to pay: inflation rates are higher than expected, so amounts payable under index-linked pensions are higher than expected: and increased contributions may be required to meet regulatory funding targets if lower interest rates increase the current value of liabilities.
These risks are managed separately for each pension scheme.
However Smiths has adopted a common approach of closing defined benefit schemes to cap members entitlements and supporting trustees in adopting investment strategies which match assets to future obligations, after allowing for the funding position of the scheme.
TIGPS with a mature member profile, and a strong funding position, has been able to progress its matching strategy to the point where 50%of liabilities are covered by matching annuities, eliminating investment return, longevity, inflation and funding risks.
In September 2013, the Trustees of the TIGPS invested a further 160m in annuities matched with specific liabilities of the Scheme.
In August 2014 SIPS adjusted the scheme investment strategy.
The scheme is now invested in diversified growth funds and a synthetic equity mandate with BlackRock, using exchange-traded futures, which are derivative contracts entered into for a fixed term, to invest in global equity markets.
If equity markets rise, the value of the synthetic equity mandate will increase, whilst if equity markets fall, the value ofthe synthetic equity mandate will fall.
The value of the mandate can be positive or negative depending upon movement in the global equity markets.
The risk and return characteristics of synthetic equities are similar to physical equities.
As at 31 July 2015 the SIPS synthetic equity futures generated a 497m 2014: nil exposure to equities.

The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA assumptions are disclosed as a weighted average.
Discount rate assumptions The UK schemes use a discount rate based on the yield on the iBOXX over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted if necessary tobetter reflect the shape of the yield curve considering the Aon Hewitt GBP Select AA curve.
For the USA, the discount rate referenced Moodys Aa annualised yield, the Citigroup High Grade Index, the Merrill Lynch 15 years High Quality Index and the Towers Watson cash-flow matching models.

The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2014 CMI projections, blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the RP-2014 table projected generationally with scale MP-14 as of 31 July 2015.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustmentfor job classification blue collar versus white collar.

152 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 10 Employee share schemes The Group operates share schemes and plans for the benefit of employees.
The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the end of the three-year performance period if performance conditions are met.
Group LTIP awards are made to selected senior corporate executives, including the executive directors.
These awards have three performance conditions: 50% of the award is conditional on three-year growth of headline EPS adjusted to exclude tax: 30% of the award is conditional on three-year TSR relative to the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies : and 20% of the award is conditional on three-year average annual headline operating cash conversion.
Divisional LTIP awards are made to selected divisional senior executives.
Divisional LTIP awards made in 2014 have six performance conditions: 30% conditional on average underlying revenue growth: 30% conditional on either revenue growth from successful acquisitions, where success is evaluated by measuring performance relative tothe acquisition case, or Return on Capital Employed ROCE, depending on the divisional priorities.
ROCE is defined in note 26: 10% conditional on improvements in new product vitality: 10% conditional on growth in revenue from China: 10% conditional on achievement of an employee engagement target, measured relative to the dynamic IBM Employee Engagement Index: and 10% conditional on improvements in divisional quality metrics.
Divisional LTIP awards made before 2014 have three performance conditions, and the relative significance of the conditions reflects thestrategic priorities for each division.
The performance conditions are: 20% to 40% of the awards are conditional on three-year revenue growth: 30% to 40% of the awards are conditional on three-year average annual headline operating margins: and 30% to 40% of the awards are conditional on three-year average annual headline operating cash conversion.
Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum performance target at or above which the award vests in full.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
The performance conditions are assessed separately, so performance on one condition does not affect the vesting of the other elements of the award.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
There is no re-testing of the .
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP participants are required to invest 50% of their post-tax bonus purchasing the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three-year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE over the performance period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the performance period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
If ROCE exceeds WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum, the enhanced performance condition is met, and a second matching share will be issued for every purchased share.

The key assumptions used in the models for 2015 and 2014 are volatility of 20% to 25% 2014: 25% and dividend yield of 3.75% 2014: 3.75%.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
These generated a weighted average fair value for CIP of 12.47 2014: 14.04, Group long-term incentive plans of 10.78 2014:12.26 and divisional long-term incentive plans of 12.55 2014: 14.12.

Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held allocated to each group of cash generating units CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash-flows of the CGU.
These forecast cash-flows are based on the 2016 budget, the four-year strategic plan approved by the Board and detailed divisional strategic projections, where these have been prepared and approved by the Board.
Goodwill is allocated by division as follows: 2015 2014 2015 Number of 2014 Number of m CGUs m CGUs John Crane 92 3 121 4 Smiths Medical 508 1 481 1 Smiths Detection 343 1 369 1 Smiths Interconnect 340 5 317 3 Flex-Tek 23 2 21 2 1,306 12 1,309 11 As required by IAS 36, the allocation of goodwill to CGUs for the Core Rotating Equipment business in John Crane has been revised following the integration of the manufacturing operations of original equipment and aftermarket businesses.
Scenario tests modelling the previous allocation indicate that there would not have been any impairment under the previous allocation.
The goodwill allocated to Smiths Interconnect Microwave has been split into three business units: Smiths Interconnect Microwave Subsystems, Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components, following a restructuring of the Smiths Interconnect Microwave operations to increase business flexibility.
There would not have been any impairment if the three new CGUs had been tested on an aggregate basis.
Goodwill impairment John Crane Production Solutions JCPS JCPS is a business unit of John Crane focused on the servicing and provision of onshore down-hole artificial lift pumping hardware and systems.
Goodwill of 5m 2014: 30m is allocated to JCPS.
An impairment test was carried out In January 2015 because the significant decline in oil prices since 31 July 2014 had adversely affected JCPS customers.
JCPS anticipated that customers would scale back expansion plans and work to reduce running costs.
Following this impairment test, the JCPS goodwill has been impaired by 27m because JCPS is now expected to have lower operating margins and less growth in the future, significantly reducing the value in use of the business.
The impairment loss has been recognised in John Crane administration expenses, and excluded from headline operating profit for the division, as part of impairment of goodwill and amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
Year ended Year ended 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 Impairment loss recognised 27m Basis of valuation value in use value in use Discount rate used for impairment test 12.9% 12.6% Long-term growth rates 2.2% 2.2% Sales assumptions for JCPS are based on: anticipated levels of maintenance and repair activities based on the current forward curve for oil prices: and expected North American drilling activity.
The gross margins included in the projections are lower than historical due to lower levels of activity.
As required by IAS 36: Impairment ofassets, margin projections for JCPS are based on the current fixed cost base, and do not incorporate any future restructuring.
Impairment testing assumptions John Crane and Smiths Medical have strong aftermarket and consumables businesses, with consistent sales trends.
Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have greater sales and margin volatility due to lower levels of recurring revenue and involvement in government-funded programmes, particularly defence, and customer-led technology innovation.
The key assumptions used in value in use calculations are: Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets.
Margins: projected margins reflect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency andleverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and risks specific to the CGU being tested.
The discount rates disclosed incorporate risk adjustments where the projected sales and margins are affected by significant delivery risks.
Pre-tax rates of 10.7% to 16.2% 2014: 10.7% to 13.6% have been used for the impairment testing.
Long-term growth rates: as required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.16% 2014: 2.03%.
These rates do not reflect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.

Sensitivity analysis Smiths Detection Smiths Detections value in use exceeds its carrying value by 117m 2014: 165m.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for Smiths Detection, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value: Year ended 31 July 2015 Year ended 31 July 2014 Change required to trigger impairment Change required to trigger impairment Forecast operating cash-flow 24% reduction 30% reduction Discount rate 250 basis points higher 300 basis points higher Long-term growth rates 670 basis points lower 690 basis points lower Sales assumptions for Smiths Detection are based on: the current order book and tenders in progress, including airport, cargo scanning and military opportunities: expected market growth rates.
Market growth drivers considered include passenger numbers for air transportation: global trade for cargo screening: increased regulatory standards to detect a wider range of substances at lower threat mass: and expected rate of replacement for units initially installed following 11 September 2001. expected rate of adoption of new products and technologies, including HI-SCAN 10080 XCT for baggage handling systems, HI-SCAN 6040-2is for critical infrastructure and Ace-ID and IONSCAN 600 for trace: and forecast servicing of the installed product base.
Margin projections for Smiths Detection are based on historical margins, projected margins on tenders in progress and the current fixed cost base.
Smiths Detection is currently implementing Fuel for Growth restructuring initiatives, see note 4.
As a result, the directors also reviewed the fair value less costs to sell for the division when considering the results of the impairment testing.
This additional work also indicated that the Smiths Detection goodwill was not impaired.

Margin projections for Smiths Interconnect Power are based on current variable costs and production capacity, and the expected costs ofincreasing capacity to support higher levels of sales.
The directors also reviewed the fair value less costs to sell for the division when considering the results of the impairment testing, which also supported the conclusion that the Smiths Interconnect Power goodwill was not impaired.
Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components Goodwill of 52m is allocated to Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components.
The value in use, calculated using a discount rate of 15.6% and a growth rate of 2.4%, exceeds its carrying value by 11m.

Margin projections for Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components incorporate the variable cost structure of the current production capacity.
The directors also reviewed the fair value less costs to sell for the division when considering the results of the impairment testing, which also supported the conclusion that the Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components goodwill was not impaired.
Other CGUs For the other CGUs, sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Other intangible assets The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year impairment tests were carried out for development projects which have not yet started to be amortised and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment.
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
No impairment charges have been incurred 2014: nil.

The cash pooling agreements incorporate a legally enforceable right of net settlement.
However there is no intention to settle the balances net, so these arrangements do not qualify for net presentation.
At 31 July 2015 and 31 July 2014 there was no material gross presentation on interest compensation cash pooling systems.
The balances held in zero balancing cash pooling arrangements are not included in this disclosure, since these arrangements have daily settlement of balances.

19 Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 15. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.
It excludes loans and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2015 contracts with a nominal value of 317m 2014: 201m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 314m 2014: 237m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 20.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the consolidated income statement in the same period that the cash-flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising as a result of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 92% are for periods of 12 months or less 2014: 100%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of year 2 Exchange adjustments Gains losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 2 1 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement revenue 4 cost of sales 1 1 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of year 3 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 163 Accounts Governance Strategic report Risks and responsibility Strategic report Operational review Strategic report Strategic overview Notes to the accounts Continued 19 Financial risk management continued Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps.
Net investment hedges The table below sets out the currency of loans and swap contracts designated as net investment hedges: At 31 July 2015 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 524 624 1,148 Cross currency swap contracts 306 302 4 Currency swap contracts 90 90 90 830 322 90 1,152 At 31 July 2014 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 588 243 831 Currency swap contracts 185 45 50 90 185 633 293 90 831 At 31 July 2015 swap contracts in other currencies hedged the Groups exposure to Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi 31July 2014: Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
All the currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges are current 2014: 58% current with the balance maturing within twoyears.
The cross currency swap contracts will mature in April 2023.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of year 58 176 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 8 118 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of year 66 58 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the followingeffect: Loss Loss recognised recognised in hedge in hedge reserve reserve 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 m m US dollar 80 64 Euro 35 29 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
Thesesensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups currentpolicy is to require interest rates to be fixed for greater than 70% of the level of gross debt.
This is achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2015 57% 2014: 63% of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixedinterest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The Group monitors its fixed rate risk profile against both gross and net debt.
For medium-term planning, it now focuses on gross debt toeliminate the fluctuations of variable cash levels over the cycle.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2015, after interest rate swaps, is 3.98% 2014: 4.51%.

These positions hedge the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates.
At 31 July 2014, the first two of these hedging arrangements were in place.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 20.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 462m 2014: 184m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2015, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a 0.2m 2014: 0.7m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
Based on the investments held at 31 July 2015 a one percentage point 100 basis points increase in sterling interest rates would reduce thecarrying value of investments by 19m 2014: 15m, generating a corresponding charge to reserves.
c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only placing cash deposits with highly rated relationship bank counterparties within counterparty limits established by reference to their Standard & Poors long-term debt rating.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade andother receivables and derivatives, totals 651m at 31 July 2015 2014: 307m.

Netting International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting agreements are in place with derivative counterparties except for contracts traded on a dedicated international electronic trading platform used for operational foreign exchange hedging.
Under these agreements if a credit event occurs, all outstanding transactions under the ISDA are terminated and only a single net amount percounterparty is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting, since the offsettingis enforceable only if specific events occur in the future, and there is no intention to settle the contracts on a net basis.

Trading Warranty provision and product liability At 31 July 2015 there are warranty and product liability provisions of 24m 2014: 35m.
Warranties over the Groups products typically coverperiods of between one and three years.
Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Commercial disputes and litigation in respect of ongoing business activities The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
Trading provisions include 1m 2014: 7m in connection with ongoing price audits of overhead cost recovery charges associated with certain historical supply arrangements.
Contingent liabilities In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation such as government price audits, product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
The Group operates in some markets where the risk of unethical or corrupt behaviour is material and has procedures, including an employee Ethics Alertline, to help it identify potential issues.
Such procedures will, from time to time, give rise to internal investigations, sometimes conducted with external support, to ensure that Smiths Group properly understands risks and concerns and can take steps both to manage immediate issues and to improve its practices and procedures for the future.
From time to time the Group also co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues.
The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financialexposures.
Exceptional and legacy John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has met defence costs directly.
Provision ismade in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
No account has been taken of recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are not yet sufficiently certain to permit recognition as an asset for these purposes.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos wasencapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 169 Accounts Governance Strategic report Risks and responsibility Strategic report Operational review Strategic report Strategic overview Notes to the accounts Continued 23 Provisions and contingent liabilities continued Exceptional and legacy continued John Crane, Inc. continued John Crane, Inc. litigation provision JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence.
Approximately 242,000 claims 2014: 235,000 claims against JCI have been dismissed before trial over the last 36 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in casesinvolving approximately 76,000 claims 2014: 80,000 claims.
Despite the large number of claims brought against JCI, since the inception of the litigation it has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in 133 cases 2014: 131 cases over the period, and has had to pay awards amounting to approximately US$153m 2014: US$149m.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs.
The litigation involves claims for a number of allegedly asbestos related diseases, with awards, when made, for mesothelioma tending to be larger than those for the other diseases JCIs ability to defend mesothelioma cases successfully is, therefore, likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
The provision is based on past history and published tables of asbestos incidence projections and is determined using asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC.
Whilst published incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease, John Crane, Inc. s claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: The period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated.
The future trend of legal costs.
The rate of future claims filed.
The rate of successful resolution of claims.
The average amount of judgments awarded.
The provision in respect of JCI is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 7.
Set out below is the gross, discounted and post-tax information relating to this provision: 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 m m Gross provision 236 227 Discount 20 23 Discounted pre-tax provision 216 204 Deferred tax 72 68 Discounted post-tax provision 144 136 John Crane, Inc. litigation provision sensitivities However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
Statistical analysis of the provision indicates that there is a 50% probability that the total future spend will fall between 221m and 248m 2014: between 212m and 239m, compared to the gross provision value of 236m 2014: 227m.
John Crane, Inc. contingent liabilities Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
JCIs claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
As a result, whilst the Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by the provision, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that the costs cannot be reliablyestimated.
Titeflex Corporation In recent years Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping product.
It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the form of purported class actions.
Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and local and national codes: however some claims have been settled on an individual basis without admission of liability.
Equivalent third-party products in the US marketplace face similar challenges.
170 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 23 Provisions and contingent liabilities continued Exceptional and legacy continued Titeflex Corporation continued Titeflex Corporation litigation provision The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with the recent market place activity, provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts.
Therefore provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of future claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
Titeflex Corporation sells flexible gas piping with extensive installation and safety guidance revised in 2008 designed to assure the safety of the product and minimise the risk of damage associated with lightningstrikes.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past experience, include: The period over which expenditure can be reliably estimated.
The number of future settlements.
The average amount of settlements.
The projections use a rolling 10 year time horizon on the basis that there is substantial uncertainty in the US litigation environment soprobable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon.
The provision of 71m 2014: 61m is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments forthe appropriate period.

Titeflex Corporation contingent liabilities The Group anticipates that litigation might continue beyond the period covered by the provision.
However, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point which reflects factors such as changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems is such that the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Other exceptional and legacy Legacy provisions comprise provisions relating to former business activities and properties no longer used by Smiths.
Exceptional provisions comprise all provisions which were disclosed as exceptional items when they were charged to the consolidated income statement.
These provisions cover exceptional reorganisation, vacant properties, disposal indemnities and litigation in respect of old products and discontinued business activities.
Reorganisation and property At 31 July 2015 there were provisions of 6m 2014: 6m related to Fuel for Growth, 6m 2014: 7m related to onerous leases and dilapidations provisions, and 1m 2014: 1m related to actual and potential environmental issues for sites which were no longer occupied bySmiths operations.
The Fuel for Growth provisions are expected to be spent in 2016.
Disposal Other provisions include disposal provisions of 3m 2014: 3m relating to warranties and other obligations in respect of the disposal of the Marine Systems and Aerospace businesses.
Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next four years.

This dividend has not been included as a liability in these accounts and is payable to all shareholders on the register of Members at close of business on 23 October 2015.
26 Reserves Retained earnings include the value of Smiths Group plc shares held by the Smiths Industries Employee Benefit Trust.
In the year the Company issued nil 2014: nil shares to the Trust, and the Trust purchased 838,032 shares 2014: 895,489 shares in the market.
At 31 July 2015 the Trust held 852 2014: 855 ordinary shares.
The capital redemption reserve, revaluation reserve and merger reserve arose from: share repurchases: revaluations of property, plant and equipment: and merger accounting for business combinations before the adoption of IFRS, respectively.
Capital management Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit related assets andliabilities, net litigation provisions relating to exceptional items and net debt.
The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to the divisions is monitored through the return on capital employed ROCE.
This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the percentage thatheadline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost ofcapital.
The Group has a target gearing, calculated on a market value basis, of approximately 20%.
At the balance sheet date the Group hadgearing of 16% 2014: 15%.
The ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of 1.4 2014: 1.4 is close to the medium term target of 1.5 to 2.0.
The Groups robust balance sheet and record of strong cash generation is more than able to fund the immediate investment needs and other legacy obligations.
As part of its capital management the Group strategy is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating to ensure access to the widest possible sources of financing and to minimise the resulting cost of capital.
At 31 July 2015 the Group had a credit rating of BBB Baa2 2014:BBB Baa2 with Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
The credit rating is managed through the following cash-flow targets: headline operating cash conversion of greater than 90% and a ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of less than two.
The Board aims for dividend cover of around 2.5 times, to ensure that the Group retains sufficient cash to finance investment in growth and to meet its legacy liabilities.

As a result, the statutory operating profit is higher, since it does not include administration costs for retirement benefit schemes, and statutory finance costs are lower, since they benefit from higher interest credits on pension assets.
There is no impact on figures reporting on a headline basis.
