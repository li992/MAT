All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control.
Control is evident where the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years presented are included in the combined and consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquiring control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Non-controlling interests are measured, at initial recognition, as the non-controlling proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.
