Notes on the Financial Statements continued 14 Fair values of financial instruments not carried at fair value Inter-relationships between key unobservable inputs Key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments may not be independent of each other.
As described above, market variables may be correlated.
This correlation typically reflects the manner in which different markets tend to react to macroeconomic or other events.
Furthermore, the effect of changing market variables upon the HSBC portfolio will depend on HSBCs net risk position in respect of each variable.

Other financial instruments not carried at fair value are typically short-term in nature and re-price to current market rates frequently.
Accordingly, their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
This includes cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from and transmission to other banks, Hong Kong Government certificates of indebtedness and Hong Kong currency notes in circulation, all of which are measured at amortised cost.

It does not reflect the economic benefits and costs that HSBC expects to flow from the instruments cash flows over their expected future lives.
Other reporting entities may use different valuation methodologies and assumptions in determining fair values for which no observable market prices are available.
Fair values of the following assets and liabilities are estimated for the purpose of disclosure as described below: Loans and advances to banks and customers The fair value of loans and advances is based on observable market transactions, where available.
In the absence of observable market transactions, fair value is estimated using valuation models that incorporate a range of input assumptions.
These assumptions may include value estimates from third-party brokers which reflect over-the-counter trading activity, forward looking discounted cash flow models using assumptions which HSBC believes are consistent with those which would be used by market participants in valuing such loans, and trading inputs from other market participants which include observed primary and secondary trades.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 391 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Notes on the Financial Statements continued 14 Fair values of financial instruments not carried at fair value 15 Financial assets designated at fair value Loans are grouped, as far as possible, into homogeneous groups and stratified by loans with similar characteristics to improve the accuracy of estimated valuation outputs.
The stratification of a loan book considers all material factors including vintage, origination period, estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios, the quality of collateral, default probability, and internal credit risk ratings.
The fair value of a loan reflects both loan impairments at the balance sheet date and estimates of market participants expectations of credit losses over the life of the loans, and the fair value effect of re-pricing between origination and the balance sheet date.
The fair value of loans and advances to customers in North America was lower than the carrying amount, primarily in the US, reflecting the market conditions at the balance sheet date.
This was due to the challenging economic conditions during the past number of years, including house price depreciation, rising unemployment, changes in consumer behaviour, changes in discount rates and the lack of financing options available to support the purchase of loans and advances.
The relative fair values increased during 2015, largely due to improved conditions in the housing industry driven by increased property values and, to a lesser extent, lower required market yields and increased investor demand for these types of loans and advances.
The fair value of loans and advances to customers in Europe is now broadly in line with carrying value, as new business from both new and existing customers reflects the current low interest rate environment.
Financial investments The fair values of listed financial investments are determined using bid market prices.
The fair values of unlisted financial investments are determined using valuation techniques that take into consideration the prices and future earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities.
Deposits by banks and customer accounts Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
The fair value of a deposit repayable on demand is approximated by its carrying value.
Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities Fair values are determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date where available, or by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements non-trading Fair values are estimated by using discounted cash flows, applying current rates.
Fair values approximate carrying amounts as their balances are generally short dated.
