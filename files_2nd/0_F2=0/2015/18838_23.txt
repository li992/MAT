The Companys transition date is 1 January 2014.
This is the first year adoption of FRS101.
There were no material amendments on the adoption of FRS101.
See note xi for further information.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
The Company is a qualifying entity as it is a member of the ITV plc Group where ITV plc, the ultimate parent prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements.
Exemptions Applied The Company is taking advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS101.
Presentation of a Statement of Cash Flows Disclosure of key management personnel compensation Disclosure of related party transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries and parents within a group Disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosure Certain disclosures required under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Disclosure of information in relation to new standards not yet applied As permitted by section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement dealing with theresults of the parent company has not been presented.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Company.
Control exists where theCompany has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The investment in the Companys subsidiaries is recorded at cost.
Annual share-based payment compensation costs are recharged to the subsidiaries through the profit and lossaccount.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured athistorical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The difference between initial fair value and the redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the profit and loss account within net financing costs, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
In this case, the effective portion of cash flow hedge is recognised in retained profits within equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the profit and loss account in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 159 Financial Statements Notes to the ITV plc Company Financial Statements continued The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Companys derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between inputs.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit orloss the fair value change and interest income expense are not separated.
Deferred tax The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement or directly in equity according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore involves judgement regarding timing and level of future taxable income.
Share-based compensation The Company utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration packages, and therefore operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, namely the Deferred Share Award DSA, Performance Share Plan PSP, Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Save As You Earn SAYE schemes.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Company receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
If the Company incurs a liability based on the price or value of the shares then this will also fall under a share-based transaction.
The fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of theshare options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, forthe Save As YouEarn scheme SAYE, a BlackScholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individualscheme.
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions.
For performance-based schemes, the relevant performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted to present value.
The Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, are recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment toequity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA.
During the year allexercises were satisfied by using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees BenefitTrust.
The weighted average share price of share options exercised during the year was 16.65p 2014: 9.02p.
Theoptions outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of nil to 206.83p and a weighted average contractual life of 1 year 2014: 1 year.
Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders ortheir payment.
Employees Two 2014: two Directors of ITV plc were employees of the Company during the year, both of whom ii remain at the year end.
The costs relating to these Directors are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.
160 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Investments in subsidiary undertakings The principal subsidiary undertakings are listed on page 166.
The balance at 31 December 2015 was iii 1,861million 2014: 1,705 million.
During the year, the Company set up a subsidiary investment, ITV Europe Holdings BV for 146 million inexchange for 10 1 ordinary shares.
The Company also increased its investment in ITV Investments Limited by 5 million in exchange for 11ordinary share.
The Company increased its investment in Carlton Communications Limited by 5 million in exchange for 11 ordinary share.
Amounts owed to from subsidiary undertakings The Company operates an intra-group cash pool policy with certain 100% owned UK subsidiaries.
The pool iv applies to bank accounts where there is an unconditional right of set off and involves the daily closing cash position for participating subsidiaries whether positive or negative, being cleared to nil via daily bank transfers to from ITV plc.
These daily transactions create a corresponding intercompany creditor or debtor which can result in significant movements in amounts owed to and from subsidiary undertakings in the Company balance sheet.
Borrowings Loans repayable in less than one year v In October 2015 the unsecured 78 million Eurobond matured, resulting in a net payment by the company of 76 million, after settlement of the related outstanding interest rate swaps.
Loans repayable after more than one year The unsecured 161 million Eurobond matures in January 2017 and has a coupon of 6.125%.
At various periods during the year the Company drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility RCF to meetshort-term funding requirements.
All short-term drawings were repaid by the end of the year.
Themaximum draw down of the RCF during the year was 500 million 362 million in April to fund the acquisition of Talpa Media.
The maximum draw down on the RCF during 2014 was 321 million to fund the2014 acquisitions.
Loans repayable after more than one year In September 2015 the Company issued a seven year 600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125%which will mature in September 2022.
The bond refinanced the 12 month bridge loan facility of 500million that was used to repay the RCF, which initially funded the purchase of Talpa Media in April.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so theyenable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date.
Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate orvice-versa or one type of floating interest rate for another and are used to manage interest rate risk.
Interest rate swaps On issuing the 2017 Eurobond, the Company entered into a portfolio of fixed to floating interest rate swaps and then subsequently overlaid a portfolio of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with the result that interest was 100% fixed on these borrowings.
The timing of entering into these swaps locked in an interest benefit for the Company, resulting in a net mark-to-market gain on the portfolio.
Cash flow hedges The Company applies hedge accounting for certain foreign currency firm commitments and highly probably cash flows where the relevant cash flows are payable within the next two years.
In order to fix thesterling cash outflows associated with the commitments which are mainly denominated in AUD or euros the Company has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts for the same foreign currency amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow.
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the revaluation loss associated with these contracts.
There was less than 1 million 2014: nil ineffectiveness taken to the income statement and 6million cumulative loss 2014: nil recycled to the income statement in the year.
Undiscounted financial liabilities The Company is required to disclose the expected timings of cash outflows for each of its derivative financial liabilities.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest, sowill not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the statement of financialposition.

The retained earnings reserves of 880 million are all distributable.
The Directors of the Company propose a final dividend of 4.1p per share and a special dividend of 10.0p pershare.
Other reserves of 36 million 2014: 36 million relate to share-buy backs in prior periods.
Contingent liabilities Under a Group registration, the Company is jointly and severally liable for VAT at 31 December 2015 of ix 59million 31 December 2014: 58 million.
The Company has guaranteed certain finance and operating lease obligations of subsidiary undertakings.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in respect of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses.
None of these items are expected to have a material effect on the Companys results or financial position.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Capital and other commitments There are no capital commitments at 31 December 2015 2014: none.
