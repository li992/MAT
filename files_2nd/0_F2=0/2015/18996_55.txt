IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reects the signicance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly orindirectly.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which fair value measurements have been categorised: 2015 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities as per the balance sheet m m m m m m m m Derivative financial instruments 192.7 192.7 140.2 140.2 There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior period.
The Level 2 fair values of derivative financial instruments have been obtained using a market approach and reect the estimated amount the Group would expect to pay or receive on termination of the instruments.
The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values of all non-derivative financial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 17.
The carrying amount less impairment provision of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans, and the carrying amount of trade payables and other payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks.
The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specic areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, investment of excess liquidity and use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk: The Groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, and as such the Groups interest rate risk arises from its borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration renancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative nancing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a dened interest rate shift.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
The Group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by using oating-to-xed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
Generally, the Group raises borrowings at oating rates and swaps them into xed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at xed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between xed contract rates and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower during the period ended 3 October 2015, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit loss for the period would have been 0.4 million 2014: 0.4 million lower higher as a result of higher lower interestexpense.
99 Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES continued For the 52 weeks ended 3 October 2015 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate swaps designated as part of a hedging arrangement The Group uses interest rate swaps to x the interest rate payable on the oating rate tranches of its securitised debt note 19.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 3 October 2015 totalled 297.2 million 2014: 322.6 million.
These interest rate swaps, including borrowing margins, x interest at 6.2% and 6.1%.
The movement in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income in the period was a loss of 43.9 million 2014: 22.1 million.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a loss of 2.4 million 2014: 4.5 million.
During the prior period the Group repurchased all of its securitised AB1 notes at par.
The notes were immediately cancelled and the associated oating-to-xed interest rate swap held in respect of this tranche of securitised debt was terminated.
This swap had been designated as a cash ow hedge of the forecast oating rate interest payments arising in respect of the AB1 notes.
As these forecast transactions were no longer expected to occur the cumulative hedging loss of 24.7 million that had been reported in equity was transferred to the income statement.
Interest rate swaps not designated as part of a hedging arrangement On 1 October 2007 the Group entered into two interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each to x the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These interest rate swaps xed interest at 5.5% and 5.6% and terminated on 1 October 2014.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a gain of nil 2014: 6.8 million.
On 22 March 2012 the Group entered into four new xed-to-oating interest rate swaps of 35.0 million each.
In total, these swaps were equal and opposite to the above two oating-to-xed interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each.
The total fair value of the four new swaps at inception was 15.1 million.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a loss of nil 2014: 6.8 million.
On the same date the Group entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps of 60.0 million each to x the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These interest rate swaps originally xed interest at 4.1% and were due to terminate on 30 April 2020.
In the prior period the termination date of the swaps was extended to 28 April 2023 and the terms were amended to x interest at 3.0% until 28 April 2016 and 4.5% thereafter.
In total, the fair value of the two swaps at inception was 18.9 million.
These swaps had previously been designated as part of a hedging relationship: however this designation was revoked at the start of the prior period.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a loss of 6.2 million 2014: 3.7 million.
The interest rate risk prole, after taking account of derivative financial instruments, is as follows: 2015 2014 Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m m Borrowings 474.5 986.3 1,460.8 388.5 1,011.7 1,400.2 The weighted average interest rate of the xed rate financial borrowings was 5.3% 2014: 5.4% and the weighted average period for which the rate is xed was 14 years 2014: 15 years.
Foreign currency risk: The Group buys and sells goods denominated in non-sterling currencies, principally US dollars and euros.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Groups income and expenditure.
The Groups exposure in this area is not considered to be significant.
Counterparty risk: The Groups counterparty risk in respect of its cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by the use of various banking institutions for its deposits.
There is no significant concentration of counterparty risk in respect of the Groups pension assets, as these are held with a range ofinstitutions.
Credit risk: Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, an assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of and adherence to credit limits is regularly monitored.
