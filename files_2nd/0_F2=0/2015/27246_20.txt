NOTE 5 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS A financial instrument is defined by ASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, as cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that creates a contractual obligation or right to deliver to or receive cash or another financial instrument from a second entity on potentially favourable terms.
Fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time, based on relevant market data, information about the financial instruments, and other factors.
Fair value was determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Estimates of fair value of financial instruments without quoted market prices are subjective in nature and involve various assumptions and estimates that are matters of judgment.
Accordingly, fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts realised on disposition of financial instruments.
The use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value amounts.
The following estimates and assumptions were used at 31 December 2015 to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: - Valuation of financial investments The loans and bonds are valued at bid price.
The Investment Manager believes that bid price is the best estimate of fair value and is in line with the valuation policy adopted by the Company.
- Cash and cash equivalents The carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
- Receivables for investments sold The carrying value reasonably approximates fair value as they reflect the value at which investments are sold to a willing buyer and settlement period on their balances is short term.
- Interest receivables The carrying value reasonably approximates fair value.
- Other receivables and prepayments The carrying value reasonably approximates fair value.
