Net investing cash outflows from Continuing operations decreased by US$3.6 billion to US$11.5 billion during FY2015 and reflected a US$3.4 billion reduction in capital and exploration expenditure.
Expenditure on growth projects totalled US$9.3 billion, including US$4.5 billion on Petroleum projects and US$4.8 billion on Minerals projects.
Sustaining capital expenditure and other items totalled US$2.6 billion.

A decrease in proceeds from interest bearing liabilities of US$2.6 billion, a decrease in contributions from non-controlling interests of US$1.4 billion and higher dividends paid to non-controlling interests of US$435 million were partially offset by a decrease in repayments of interest bearing liabilities of US$2.9 billion during FY2015.
