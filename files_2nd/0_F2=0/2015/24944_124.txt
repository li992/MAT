HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 414 Details of all HSBC subsidiaries, as required under Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006, are set out on pages 458 to 469.
The principal countries of operation are the same as the countries of incorporation except for HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, which operates mainly in the Middle East and North Africa, and HSBC Life International Limited, which operates mainly in Hong Kong.
HSBC is structured as a network of regional banks and locally incorporated regulated banking entities.
Each bank is separately capitalised in accordance with applicable prudential requirements and maintains a capital buffer consistent with the Groups risk appetite for the relevant country or region.
HSBCs capital management process culminates in the annual Group capital plan, which is approved by the Board.
HSBC Holdings is the primary provider of equity capital to its subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital where necessary.
These investments are substantially funded by HSBC Holdings issuance of equity and non-equity capital and by profit retention.
As part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a balance between the composition of its capital and its investment in subsidiaries.
Subject to this, there is no current or foreseen impediment to HSBC Holdings ability to provide funding for such investments.
The ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance.
During 2015, none of the Groups subsidiaries experienced significant restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances.
Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged by our subsidiaries, with the exception of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances.
The amount of guarantees by HSBC Holdings in favour of other HSBC Group entities is set out in Note 37.
