1.2 Investment income, expenses and charges Investment income is accrued up to the balance sheet date.
Investment expenses and charges are recognised on an accruals basis.
1.3 Taxation Taxation is based on profits for the period as determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation, together with adjustments to provisions for prior periods.
Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits to utilise carried forward tax losses against which the reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.

Under FRS 20, Share-based payment, where the Company, as the Parent Company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
