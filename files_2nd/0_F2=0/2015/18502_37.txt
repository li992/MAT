The effective tax rate is higher than the UKs headline tax rate due to the geographic mix of countries in which Fidessa operates.
Several of these countries have headline tax rates that are greater than that in the UK, the two resulting in the greatest variance for Fidessa being the US and Japan.
The effect of overseas income incurring higher tax rates is partially offset by government tax incentives.
These arise from enhanced deductions for research and development and for capital expenditure in certain jurisdictions.
Fidessa continues to recognise certain provisions and accruals in respect of tax which involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty, including those related to transfer pricing, when the tax treatment cannot finally be determined until accepted by the relevant tax authority.
Adjustments relating to prior years arise from the resolution of specific uncertainties, and the remaining risks are appropriately reflected in the recognised provisions and accruals.
