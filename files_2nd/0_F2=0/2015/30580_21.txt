ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of these financial statements, are set out below: a Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom company law, generally accepted accounting standards UK GAAP, the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts dated January 2009 the SORP and on a going concern basis, as set out on page 29, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Companys financial statements are presented in sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
b Investments Held at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss Quoted investments have been designated by the Board as held at fair value through profit or loss and accordingly are valued at fair value, deemed to be bid, or last trade, price depending on the convention of the exchange on which it is quoted.
Unquoted investments are designated by the Board as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are valued by the Directors using primary valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, option pricing models, discounted cash flow analysis, recent transactions and in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association IPEVCA valuation guidelines.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Income Statement as gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Also included within this caption are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments, including the difference between the purchase price of an investment and its price at the time of purchase.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments namely put and call options and equity swaps to enhance returns and mitigate risk.
All derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the Balance Sheet in accordance with FRS 26: Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The equity swaps are accounted for as Fixed Assets in the Balance Sheet and Options are accounted for as Current Assets or Current Liabilities in the Balance Sheet.
Options are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and gains and losses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement, where the option has been entered into to generate or protect capital returns.
All of the put and call options bought and sold during the year have been capital in nature.
All gains and losses on over-the-counter OTC equity swaps are accounted for as gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Where there has been a re-positioning of the swap, gains and losses are accounted for on a realised basis.
All such gains and losses have been debited or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Cash collateral held by counterparties is included within cash, except where there is a right of offset against the overdraft facility.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued d Investment Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised on the ex-dividend date.
Where no ex-dividend date is quoted, dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
UK dividends are shown net of tax credits and foreign dividends are grossed up at the appropriate rate of withholding tax.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate.
Deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, categorised as fixed assets held at fair value through profit or loss are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement: and expenses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the portfolio management and AIFM fees have been charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the portfolio management and AIFM fees are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any performance fee accrued or paid is charged in full to the capital column of the Income Statement.
f Finance Costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs are charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the finance costs are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Finance charges, if applicable, including interest payable and premiums on settlement or redemption, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
g Taxation The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between capital and revenue using the marginal basis.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the Balance Sheet date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided for at the average rate of tax expected to apply.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to reflect the time value of money.
h Foreign Currency Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
Any gains or losses on the translation of foreign currency balances, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital or the revenue column of the Income Statement, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.

The Directors are of the opinion that sterling best represents the Companys functional currency.
j Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash in hand and in banks and short-term deposits which are held to maturity are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand, which form an integral part of the Companys cash management, are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
k Capital Reserves The following are transferred to this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: realised and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature: expenses, together with the related taxation effect, in accordance with the above policies: and increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end.
l Repurchase of Share Capital When share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares which are not cancelled are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from equity.
m Dividend Payments Dividends paid by the Company on its shares are recognised in the financial statements in the year in which they are paid and are shown in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds.

OrbiMed employs the following option strategies, or a combination of such: Buy calls: provides leveraged long exposure while minimising capital at risk: Buy puts: provides leveraged protection, against price falls while minimising capital at risk: Sell calls: against an existing position, provides partial protection from a decline in stock price, facilitates commitment to an exit strategy and exit price that is consistent with fundamental analysis: Sell puts: provides an effective entry price at which to add to an existing position, or provides an effective entry price at which to initiate a new position.
OTC equity swaps The Company uses OTC equity swap positions to gain access to Indian markets and Chinese markets because the Company is not locally registered to trade in either market and gain exposure to thematic baskets of stocks.
Details of funded and financed swap positions are noted in the Portfolio on page 9.
Collateral cash of 9.0 million was held against the financed swap positions, of which 1.4 million was offset against the overdraft position.
The equivalent amount in 2014 was 4.8 million which as part of the arrangements in place at the time was offset against the overdraft.
Offsetting disclosure Swap basket trades and OTC derivatives are traded under ISDA Master Agreements.
The Company currently has such agreements in place with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
International Swap Dealers Association Inc. See Glossary on page 70 for description of funded and financed swaps.
Worldwide Healthcare Trust PLC 63 Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2015 235876 Finsbury WWH pp52-pp68new 03 07 2015 12:40 Page 64 These agreements create a right of set-off that becomes enforceable only following a specified event of default, or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal course of business.
As a result, as the right of set-off is not unconditional, for financial reporting purposes, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities.
i Other price risk In pursuance of the Companys Investment Objective the Companys portfolio, including its derivatives, is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in market prices and foreign exchange rates.
The Board manage these risks through the use of limits and guidelines, monthly compliance reports from Frostrow and reports from Frostrow and OrbiMed presented at each Board meeting, as set out on pages 20 to 22.
Other price risk exposure The Companys gross exposure to other price risk is represented by the fair value of the investments and the underlying exposure through the derivative investments held at the year end as shown in the table below.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices of all of the Companys financial instruments including the derivatives at the Balance Sheet date had been 25% higher or lower 2014: 25% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant: the revenue return would have decreased increased by 102,000 2014: 68,000 : the capital return would have increased by 281,352,000 2014: 183,196,000 decreased by 283,432,000 2014: 183,417,000 : and, the return on equity would have increased by 281,250,000 2014: 183,128,000 decreased by 283,330,000 2014: 183,349,000.
The calculations are based on the portfolio as at the respective Balance Sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
ii Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys portfolio and derivative positions are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency, and the currency in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the sterling value of those items.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are shown below: 2015 2014 Current Current Current Current assets liabilities Investments assets liabilities Investments 000 000 000 000 000 000 U.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not considered significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable within one week, in normal market conditions.
Liquidity exposure and maturity Contractual maturities of the financial liability exposures as at 31 March 2015, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, are as follows: 2015 2014 3 months 3 months or less or less 000 000 Overdraft facility 89,231 62,723 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 1,789 20,834 Derivatives Put options short 488 979 Derivatives Call options short 480 72 91,988 84,608 v Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of failure of a counterparty to discharge its obligations resulting in the Company suffering a financial loss.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk at the Balance Sheet date.
The Companys quoted securities are held on its behalf by J. P. Morgan Clearing Corp acting as the Companys Prime Broker.
As noted on page 21, certain of the Companys assets can be held by J. P. Morgan Clearing Corp as collateral against the overdraft provided by them to the Company.

The Boards policy is to limit gearing to a maximum of 20% of the Companys net assets.
The capital structure of the Company consists of the equity share capital, retained earnings and other reserves as disclosed on the Balance Sheet on page 50.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as total assets less current liabilities before deducting any prior charges including the overdraft, minus cash and cash equivalents divided by Shareholders funds, expressed as a percentage.
As at 31 March 2015, the Company had a gearing percentage of 11.2% 2014: 12.0%.
The Board, with the assistance of the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This includes a review of: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Portfolio Managers view of the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in treasury, in light of any share price discount to net asset value per share in accordance with the Companys share buy-back policy: the need for new issues of equity shares, including issues from treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting year.
