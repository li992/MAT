For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by management with reference to relevant available information, including the current market value of similar instruments and discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Other investments include listed investments of 987 million 2014 892 million, the increase arising from additions, fair value adjustments and the transfer of the Groups investment in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited from Investments in associates to Other investments, offset by the transfer of the Groups investment in Theravance, Inc. to Investments in associates and disposals and impairments, principally relating to Aspen.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held 22.1% of the common stock of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.
The Groups investment in Theravance Biopharma is accounted for as an equity investment as the Group does not have the power to exert significant inuence over the activities of the company.
In 2014, the Group and Theravance Biopharma entered into a governance agreement which expires in 2017.
Under this agreement, the Group does not have the right to appoint a director to the Theravance Biopharma board and must with certain limited exceptions vote its shares either in support of the recommendation of the independent directors of the board or in proportion to other shareholders votes cast.
On 1 September 2015, a similar governance agreement with another investee, Theravance, Inc. now Innoviva, Inc. expired.
The expiry of this agreement was considered to provide the Group with the ability to exert significant inuence over the activities of the company and the Group has therefore accounted for its shareholding as an investment in an associate since that date.
In March 2015, the Group sold half of its shareholding in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited, an investment which it had previously accounted for as an associate.
As a result of the sale, the Group was no longer considered to have the ability to exert significant inuence over Aspen and the Groups remaining investment was transferred from Investments in associates to Other investments.
At 31 December 2015, this investment had a fair value of 383 million.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The impairment losses recorded above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within Other operating income, together with amounts reclassied from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.
The carrying value at 31 December of Other investments which have been impaired is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Original cost 1,049 558 Cumulative impairments recognised in the income statement 549 420 Subsequent fair value increases 279 268 Carrying value at 31 December 779 406 22 Other non-current assets 2015 2014 m m Amounts receivable under insurance contracts 477 447 Pension schemes in surplus 258 93 Other receivables 255 195 990 735 GSK Annual Report 2015 167
