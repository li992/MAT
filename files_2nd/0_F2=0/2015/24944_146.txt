Notes on the Financial Statements continued 40 Legal proceedings and regulatory matters 41 Related party transactions In addition, HSBC Holdings, HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Bank USA were named as defendants, amongst others, in numerous putative class actions filed in the New York District Court and the Illinois District Court.
These class actions allege that the defendants, which include ISDA, Markit and several other financial institutions, conspired to restrain trade in violation of US antitrust laws by, amongst other things, restricting access to credit default swap pricing exchanges and blocking new entrants into the exchange market.
The plaintiffs in these suits purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased credit default swaps from or sold credit default swaps to defendants primarily in the US.
In October 2013, these cases were consolidated in the New York District Court the Consolidated Action.
In September 2015, the HSBC defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to resolve the Consolidated Action, subject to court approval.
In October 2015, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.

Economic plans: HSBC Bank Brasil S. A.
In the mid-1980s and early 1990s, certain economic plans were introduced by the government of Brazil to reduce escalating inflation.
The implementation of these plans adversely impacted savings account holders, thousands of which consequently commenced legal proceedings against financial institutions in Brazil, including HSBC Bank Brasil S. A. HSBC Brazil, alleging, amongst other things, that savings account balances were adjusted by a different price index than that contractually agreed, which caused them a loss of income.
Certain of these cases have reached the Brazilian Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court has suspended all cases pending before lower courts until it delivers a final judgement on the constitutionality of the changes resulting from the economic plans.
It is anticipated that the outcome of the Supreme Courts final judgement will set a precedent for all cases pending before the lower courts.
Separately, the Brazilian Superior Civil Court is considering matters relating to, amongst other things, contractual and punitive interest rates to be applied to calculate any loss of income.
There is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which the proceedings in the Supreme Court and Superior Civil Court will be resolved and the timing of such resolutions, including the amount of losses that HSBC Brazil may be liable to pay in the event of an unfavourable judgement.
Such losses may lie in a range from a relatively insignificant amount to an amount up to $564m based on the exchange rate between the USD and the BRL as at 31 December 2015, although the upper end of this range is considered unlikely.
Regulatory review of consumer enhancement services products HSBC Finance, through its legacy Cards and Retail Services business, offered or participated in the marketing, distribution, or servicing of products, such as identity theft protection and credit monitoring products, that were ancillary to the provision of credit to the consumer.
HSBC Finance ceased offering these products by May 2012.
The offering and administration of these and other enhancement services products, such as debt protection products, has been the subject of enforcement actions against other institutions by regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Such enforcement actions have resulted in orders to pay restitution to customers and the assessment of penalties in substantial amounts.
We have made restitution to certain customers in connection with certain enhancement services products, and we continue to cooperate with our regulators in connection with their ongoing review.
In light of the actions that regulators have taken in relation to other non-HSBC credit card issuers regarding their enhancement services products, one or more regulators may order us to pay additional restitution to customers and or impose civil money penalties or other relief arising from the prior offering and administration of such enhancement services products by HSBC Finance: however, management no longer expects the resulting financial impact to be material.
