Dened benefit plans The Group operates a number of dened benefit schemes and unfunded schemes.
Of these, the principal schemes are the dened benefit plans in the UK and the unfunded scheme in Sweden.
Within the United Kingdom, the group now operates only the one registered dened benefit pension scheme Berendsen DB UK Retirement Benets Scheme formerly known as the Davis Service Group Retirement Benets Scheme, following a merger with the one other smaller scheme on 1 February 2013.
The triennial valuation of the newly merged scheme at that date required that, as well as the employer contributions for the 110 active members of the scheme, Berendsen continue contributions to cover the past service deficit, arising under the technical provisions, of 1.25 million per quarter until August 2015.
A further triennial valuation is being carried out at 1 February 2016 and once nalised any further contributions required to be made by the Company will be assessed at that time.
This valuation is expected to be completed in late 2016 and no additional contributions are expected to be made by the company in 2016.
Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 175 27 Pension commitments continued The level of benets provided depends on each members length of scheme membership and salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the UK plan, the pensions in payment are generally increased by 5% in respect of pre-1 February 1999 membership, and by the retail price index for membership from that date.
benefit payments are made from trustee administered funds.
Plan assets are governed by regulations in the UK, as is the nature of the relationship between the group and the trustees and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the plan, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the company and the trustees.
The trustees must comprise of representatives of the company and plan members in accordance with legislation.
Overseas, there is a comparatively small dened benefit scheme operated in Ireland.
Along with the scheme in Sweden, further unfunded schemes exist within Germany, Norway and Poland.
Under all unfunded schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall surplus on the plans is 15.8 million of which 44.6 million surplus is in respect of the UK plan.
There is a deficit of 28.8 million on other funded and unfunded plans, of which 25.4 million relates to Sweden.
Where a dened benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a dened contribution pension scheme.
At the last valuation date the present value of the dened benefit obligation was comprised of 588 active employees, 2,516 deferred members and 1,561 members in retirement.
Expected contributions, including special contributions, to post employment benefit schemes for the year ended 31 December 2016 are 1.0 million 2015: 6.4 million.
The weighted average duration of the dened benefit obligation across all schemes is 17.6 years 2014: 18.4 years.
The actuarial valuations of the UK scheme, together with the other dened benefit schemes operated by the group have been updated as at 31 December 2015 by qualied actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2015 2014 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.8 2.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.8 2.8 Discount rate 3.8 3.5 Ination rate RPI 2.8 2.8 Ination rate CPI 1.8 2.0 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.

In the case of the funded plans, the group ensures that the investment position is managed within a framework that considers the Schemes liability prole, funding position, expected return of the various asset classes and the need for diversication.
Within this framework, the groups objective is to ensure that sufficiently liquid assets are available to meet benefit payments and the Schemes assets achieve a return that is consistent with the assumptions made by the Trustees in determining the funding of the Scheme.
A large portion of assets in 2015 consists of equities and bonds, although the Scheme also invests in diversied growth funds and a small amount of cash.
The majority of equities are invested in a globally diversied portfolio of international blue chip entities with a target of 35% UK and 65% overseas.
The other growth assets are the diversied growth funds which have a target of 32% of the overall portfolio.
The remainder of the Schemes assets are invested in corporated bonds.
The trustees sought the employers agreement to implement a Liability Driven Investment portfolio.
This will use specialist assets that employ leverage, to match more of the Schemes liabilities, for a given asset value, than a conventional bond.
This portfolio will be implemented when market conditions become more favourable.
The group agreed that it would aim to eliminate the deficit on a technical provisions basis by the end of 2015 and deficit contributions of 1.25 million per quarter have been made to achieve this.
Funding levels are monitored on a quarterly basis and the current agreed contribution rate in respect of active members is 29.5% of pensionable salaries.
These contribution rates were set following the completion of the latest triennial valuation of the scheme as at 1 February 2013.
The next triennial valuation is due later in 2016 after which further contribution rates will be assessed.
