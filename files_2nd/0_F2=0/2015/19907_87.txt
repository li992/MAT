01 Strategic report 02 Corporate governance 03 Financial statements 04 Other information SECTION 2: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR CONTINUED 2.5 Tax The Group has not paid any corporation tax in the recent past due to the availability of capital allowances, indexation and brought forward losses.
However, it does pay UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
The deferred tax provision in respect of property assets is calculated on the basis that assets will not be held indefinitely and therefore takes account of available indexation.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Forecasting future taxable profits to which these losses will be offset requires significant judgements and assumptions regarding future performance.
The recoverability of the assets recognised could vary significantly if different assumptions are applied in estimating future taxable profits.
In addition, the intended conversion to a REIT in early 2017 may make some of the tax losses inaccessible at some point in the future.
Deferred tax assets in respect of forecast taxable profits have been restricted to the next financial year.
