92 Notes to the Accounts General accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union as at 31 December 2015.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments.
After reviewing group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements see the Directors Report on page 140.
Consolidation a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
The group controls an entity when it has power over the entity: is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity: and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the group reassesses whether or not it controls a subsidiary if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
The group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries please refer to Note B1.
Inter-company transactions, balances, and gains and losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Changes in the groups interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity.
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
b Associates Associates are those entities in which the group has significant influence over the financial and operating policies, but not control.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Gains and losses on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the associates.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the groups functional and presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, or from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at reporting period end exchange rates, are recognised under the appropriate heading in the income statement: except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges or where certain intra-group loans are determined to be quasi-equity normally not expected to be repaid.
c Group companies The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 93 Notes to the Accounts On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments or deemed to be quasi-equity, are taken to other comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period end exchange rates.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below please refer to the notes for further detail.
Sensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in the relevant notes to the accounts.
Estimated impairment of goodwill Note B2 Valuation of acquired intangible assets Note B2 Income taxes and deferred tax asset Notes A13 and A15 Provision for vacant property and environmental restoration Note A6 Retirement benefits Note A10 Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards that are mandatorily effective for the current year The group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with effect from 1 January 2015: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions amendments to IAS 19 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 cycle and 2011-2013 cycle amendments to IFRS 1, 2, 3, 8 and 13 and IAS 16, 24, 38 and 40 The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures of the amounts recognised in the groups consolidated financial statements.
Consequently, no adjustment has been made to the comparative financial information at 31 December 2014.
The group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.
The group will consider the impact on the financial statements of relevant forthcoming standards during the coming year, including IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases.

Segment information Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received from customers for the rendering of services, net of value-added tax VAT and other similarsales-based taxes, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating sales within the group.
For non-contract-based business, revenue represents thevalue of goods delivered or services performed.
For contract-based business, revenue represents the sales value of work carried out for customers during the period.
Contract income is recognised in accounting periods on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.
For long-term contracts involving the installation of equipment, revenue is recognised using the percentage completion method and represents the sales value of work executed during the period.
Segment reporting Segmental information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Reporting segments reflect the internal management organisation and reporting structures.
Each segment is headed by a Regional Managing Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive and is a member of the Company Executive Board responsible for the review of group performance.
The operating businesses within each segment report to the Regional Managing Directors.
Profit is shown before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets excluding computer software, and restructuring costs and one-off items that have had a significant impact on the results of the group.
These costs have been separately identified as they are not considered to be business as usual expenses and have a varying impact on different businesses and reporting periods.
Revenue and profit excludes revenue and profit from businesses disposed and closed.
Constant exchange rates CER are used to assist with the year on year comparisons.
Revenue and operating profit relate to the following main groups of business category and activity, as described on page 3: Pest Control, Hygiene and Workwear.
Other represents a number of small businesses outside of the main categories, the largest being the Plants business.
Central and regional overheads represent corporate expenses that are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares inissue during the year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust see note at the bottom of the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which are treated as cancelled, and including share options for which all conditions have been met.
Adjusted earnings per share is earnings per share adjusted for the after-tax effects of restructuring costs and one-off items, amortisation and impairment 1 of intangibles, and net interest credit from pensions.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all potential dilutive ordinary shares.
Thegroup has two types of potential dilutive ordinary shares those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period, and the contingent issuable shares under the groups long-term incentive share plans to the extent the performance conditions have been met at the end of the period.

Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The creation and release of provisions for impaired trade receivables have been included within operating expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the provision for impairment of trade receivables are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
Book value approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the receivables and the low-interest environment in which they are held.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the groups customer base being large and diverse.
The maximum amount of credit risk with respect to customers is represented by the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
The group policy is that credit facilities for new customers are approved by designated managers at regional level.
Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and reports from credit rating agencies.
Overdue accounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
There were no new customers in 2015 where the group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.

Provisions for other liabilities and charges Vacant property, environmental, self-insurance and other provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount is capable of being reliably estimated.
If such an obligation isnot capable of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for vacant properties and environmental restoration.
Vacant properties and environmental restoration tend to be long-term in nature and the use of an appropriate market discount rate and forecast future utilisation based upon managements best estimate determines the level of provision required at the balance sheet date.
The phasing and actual cash spend may be different from the original forecast spend.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated on the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The present value is calculated using forward market interest rates, as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks already reflected in future cash flow estimates.

The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at 31 December 2015 is 1.5m 2014: 1.3m.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in Europe and the US where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next ten years.
Self-insurance Since 2008 the group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks, but prior to this the group self-insured its risks.
Provision is still held for self-insured past cover, primarily in relation to workers compensation US.
For the continuing self-insured programmes, individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims is based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date and is accumulated as claims provisions.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses and restructuring costs.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next five years.
The above provisions have been discounted where appropriate using discount rates of between 0.9% and 1.4% 2014: between 0.7% and 1.3% for the UK, 0.5% 2014: 0.6% for Europe and 2.2% 2014: 2.2% for the US.

Employee benefit expense Profit-sharing and bonus plans The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the probability of certain performance criteria being achieved.
A provision is recognised where a contractual obligation exists or where past practice indicates that there is a constructive obligation to make such payments in the future.
Holiday pay Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned.
An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned but not yet taken.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is material.

Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal pension scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme RIPS in the UK formerly the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme, which has a number of defined benefit sections, now closed to new entrants, and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit scheme is funded through payments to a trustee-administered fund, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
A number of much smaller defined benefit and defined contribution schemes operate elsewhere which are also funded through payments to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies.
Defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions.
Significant judgement is required in determining these actuarial assumptions.
Defined benefit pension plans A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that estimates the amount of future pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
The group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined asset.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA, are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The group will recognise a pension surplus as an asset where there is an unconditional right to a refund or where the group has a right to reduce future pension contributions, taking into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
Current and past service costs, to the extent they have vested, and curtailments are recognised as charges or credits against operating profit in the income statement.
Interest costs on the net defined benefit obligation are recognised in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Defined contribution pension plans A defined contribution plan is apension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into aseparate entity.
The group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Other post-employment obligations Some group companies provide post-employment healthcare benefits to their retirees.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The expected costs of these benefits are accruedover the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme RIPS During the year the defined benefit liabilities of the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme were transferred to a new mirror scheme the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme.
Defined benefit members with benefits worth less than 18,000 including any defined contribution funds were given the option to be excluded from the bulk transfer in order that they could be paid a Winding-Up Lump Sum WULS on the subsequent wind-up of the old scheme.
The overall cost for this exercise was 0.4m which was taken to one-off items.
The assets of the RIPS are legally separated from the group.
The Trustee of the pension fund is Rentokil Initial Pension Trustee Limited.
The board comprises six Company nominated directors and three member nominated directors.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, contribution and indexation policies of the scheme.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are usually carried out every three years.
At 31 December 2015 RIPS was valued at an accounting surplus of 237.0m 2014: 192.2m on the groups balance sheet.
The trustees of the scheme value the scheme on a different basis and in the valuation at 31 March 2013 a deficit of 17.8m was agreed.
It is expected that this deficit will be made good by excess returns above the discount rate over the period to 31 January 2019: however the group will make contributions of 3.2m each year into escrow over this period, subject to a review as part of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2016.
In the event that the deficit is not cleared by the time of the 31 March 2019 valuation it will be funded from the escrow account.
The valuations stated exclude the escrow balance which stands at 6.4m as at 31 December 2015 31 December 2014: 3.2m.
The group continues to recognise the escrow balance as restricted cash.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 103 Notes to the Accounts The group has put in place a guarantee in favour of the Trustee of the RIPS which provides that the group willmake payments to the scheme up to a maximum amount equal to the lowest non-negative amount which, when added to the assets of the scheme, would result in the scheme being at least105% funded on the date on which any liability arises, calculated on the basis set out in section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This amount will vary and is in any event capped at 219m, the amount assessed at 31 March 2009.
The provision of the guarantee is reviewed on an annual basis.
The defined benefit schemes are reappraised semi-annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements.
The assumptions used for the RIPS scheme are shown below.
2015 2014 Weighted average % Discount rate 3.8% 3.4% Future salary increases n a n a Future pension increases 3.3% 3.2% RPI inflation 3.4% 3.3% CPI inflation 2.3% 2.2% The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners.
Approximately 44% of the liabilities are attributable to current and former employees and 56% to current pensioners.
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted average time until benefit payments are made.
For the scheme as a whole, the duration is around 16 years.
There have been no significant changes to the membership of the scheme over the year.
Where available, the bid value of assets has been used.
In other cases the market value as provided by the investment managers has been used.
The schemes liability hedge is made upofinterest rate and inflation swaps, corporate bonds, fixed gilts and LPI swaps.
The overallobjectiveof the hedge isto match85% oftheinterest rate and inflation sensitivityof the schemes liabilities c. 100% of assets.
The current portfolios return-seeking assets consist of equities 5% and diversified growth funds 15%.
Diversified growth funds invest in a range of asset classes including developed market equities, emerging market equities, hedge funds, infrastructure, commodities, private equity, property, high yield credit, emerging market debt, investment grade credit, reinsurance and leveraged loans.
Matching assets consist of 55% gilts, 14% credit, and 11% cash and swaps.
The actual holdings in return seeking assets are currently higher than the target portfolio.
This is monitored on a regular basis, andthere are no plans to rebalance at present.
Risks The scheme exposes the Company to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets global equities and diversified growth funds which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will give rise to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also reduce the surplus.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of scheme members, and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
The mortality tables used are: 94% of the SAPS All base tables for male pensioners and male and female dependants: 106% of the SAPS All base tables for female pensioners: 104% of the SAPS All base tables for male non-pensioners: and 107% of the SAPS All base tables for female non-pensioners.
Further improvements are made in line with CMI 2013 Core Projections with a long-term rate of future improvement of 1.25% p. a.

Share-based payments Share-based compensation The group operates one equity-settled share-based long-term incentive plan.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement, equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of shares that vest or options that are expected to become exercisable.
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service, and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
Performance Share Plan The Company introduced a share-based performance plan in 2006 for senior executives worldwide.
The main features of the scheme are as follows: For awards made in 2008, the performance conditions are share price performance and an individual performance modifier.
For awards made between 2009 and 2013, the performance conditions are Total Shareholder Return TSR performance and an individual performance modifier.
No shares will vest or options become exercisable if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the three year performance period relative to the constituents of a comparator group, made up of FTSE 350 companies excluding financial services, primary resource and property sector companies.
If TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain their maximum bonus target over the performance period, the full award will vest or become exercisable.
For awards made in 2014 and 2015, one third of the award is based on Earnings Per Share EPS growth targets as outlined in the relevant years Remuneration Report, and two-thirds of the award is based on TSR over the three year performance period as explained above.
For Executive Directors an individual performance modifier also applies as outlined above.
The value of dividends paid during the vesting period are paid on the number of shares that ultimately vest in the form of additional shares.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 2.2m 2014: 1.1m.
A summary of the number of shares in active share option plans is shown below: Scheme Shares Shares interest at Shares Shares Shares Outstanding at exercisable Shares Shares Shares exercisable at Year of 1 January awarded vested lapsed 31 December at 1 January vested exercised lapsed 31 December grant Vesting year 2015 during 2015 during 2015 during 2015 2015 2015 during 2015 during 2015 during 2015 2015 2008 2011 184,181 61,770 5,163 117,248 2012 2015 10,708,555 3,217,467 7,491,088 3,217,467 2,376,604 840,863 2013 2016 8,418,183 128,721 8,289,462 2014 2017 6,879,083 343,844 6,535,239 2015 2018 7,487,033 577,317 6,909,716 The fair value of the 2015 awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a model developed by Deloitte LLP.
This is a closed-form solution similar to a Monte Carlo simulation which takes account of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met.
For the shares awarded on 31 March 2015, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 135.5p 2014:123.4p, an expected share price volatility of 21% 2014:26%, a median share price correlation between the companies in the comparator group of 27% 2014:24%, and an expected life commensurate with the three-year performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting period.
The fair value of shares granted during 2015 was 7.3m.

Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The group leases properties, vehicles, and plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is 36.3m 2014: 41.2m.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Not later than one year 37.6 40.2 Later than one year and not later than five years 82.4 81.2 Later than five years 11.5 15.7 131.5 137.1 A13.
Income tax expense This note analyses the tax charge for this financial period which includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax expense represents the amount payable on this years taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior years.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences between accounting and tax bases.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.

This compares with a blended rate of tax for the countries in which the group operates of 26% 2014: 26%.
The lower adjusted effective tax rate compared to the blended tax rate is principally due to the benefit of previously unrecognised brought forward tax losses being set off against UK profits and an increase in the deferred tax asset recognised on the UK tax losses.
The groups effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK tax rate due to the proportion of overseas profits which are taxed at a higher rate than UK profits.
We expect the effective tax rate for 2016 to be around 24%.
The groups tax charge and effective tax rate will be influenced by the global mix and level of profits, changes in future tax rates and other tax legislation, the utilisation of brought forward tax losses on which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, the resolution of open issues with various tax authorities, acquisitions and disposals.
The groups adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be similar to the blended tax rate once there is no further benefit from tax losses on which no deferred tax asset is currently recognised as their recoverability is not considered probable, but may become probable in the future.
Current tax liabilities The group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
The groups current tax liabilities reflect managements best estimate of the future amounts of corporation tax that will be settled.
The group is subject to various uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities where the ultimate tax liability cannot be known until a resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or the issue becomes time barred.
Issues can take many years to resolve and therefore assumptions on the likely outcome have to be made by management.
Where considered appropriate management establishes provisions for uncertain tax positions on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Total tax provisions and accruals amounted to 54.5m as at 31 December 2015 2014: 48.4m.
The increase in the tax provision is mainly due to another years provision in respect of existing identified exposures for which accruals had already been established.
Tax accruals can be built up over a number of years but in the year of resolution there could be adjustments to these accruals which could have a material positive or negative impact on the tax charge for a particular year.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes particularly in relation to the pricing of intra-group goods and services, as well as debt financing.
The majority of the tax provisions relate to transfer pricing exposures where the group faces a number of transfer pricing risks in jurisdictions around the world and is subject to tax audits by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates.
Apart from transfer pricing issues the largest single provision relates to a financing structure where the amount provided is now 18.1m.
This is a legacy issue going back to the years 2002 to 2005 and two test cases involving similar structures are currently being litigated.
The group is fully provided for the potential tax and interest payable so there should not be an adverse impact on the income statement.
The issue is expected to take several more years to resolve.

Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affect neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
In the 2015 Summer Budget the Chancellor announced a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and 18% effective from 1 April 2020 and these rates were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
The UK deferred tax liability at 31 December 2015 has been calculated based on the corporation tax rate that is expected to apply when the liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
In recognising the deferred tax asset in respect of UK losses, management have estimated the quantum of future UK taxableprofits.
The movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 1 January 74.8 53.5 Exchange differences 3.2 3.8 Acquisition of companies and businesses 31.0 7.9 Disposal of companies and businesses 0.6 Transfers to current taxation 0.1 0.2 Charged credited to the income statement 2.4 2.3 Charged credited to equity 5.9 19.9 At 31 December 110.8 74.8 Deferred taxation has been presented on the balance sheet as follows: Deferred tax asset within non-current assets 2.0 3.5 Deferred tax liability within non-current liabilities 112.8 78.3 110.8 74.8 The major components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction are as follows: Unremitted Customer Accelerated earnings lists tax Retirement from Tax Share-based intangibles depreciation benefits subsidiaries losses payments Other Total m m m m m m m m At 31 December 2014 24.2 54.5 31.7 5.5 24.8 1.1 15.2 74.8 Recognised in income statement 1.6 0.4 3.3 3.1 0.2 2.4 Recognised in other comprehensive income 7.1 1.2 5.9 Exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income 0.1 3.1 3.2 Transferred to current taxation 0.1 0.1 Acquired in business combinations 31.0 31.0 At 31 December 2015 56.6 51.8 42.1 5.5 27.9 0.9 16.4 110.8 A deferred tax asset of 26.1m 2014: 24.7m has been recognised in respect of UK losses carried forward at 31 December 2015.
This amount has been calculated by estimating the future UK taxable profits, against which the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying the tax rates substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date applicable for each year.
Remaining UK tax losses of 155.5m have not been recognised as at 31 December 2015.
At the balance sheet date the group has tax losses of 236.7m 2014: 279.4m on which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Of the losses 29.3m 2014: 12.4m will expire at various dates between 2016 and 2035.
In addition, there are capital losses carried forward of 277.1m 2014: 285.2m on which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Other deferred tax assets relating to gross temporary timing differences of 9.1m 2014: 10.4m have not been recognised due to the uncertainty regarding their utilisation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 110 Notes to the Accounts B.
Business combinations Under the requirements of IFRS 3, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method acquisition accounting.
The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer.
The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising at their fair values the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
An intangible asset is recognised if it meets the definition of an intangible asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The intangible assets identified in all acquisitions made since 1 January 1998 are goodwill, customer lists and relationships, brands, and contract portfolios.
Consideration in excess of net identifiable assets acquired in respect of non-controlling interests in existing subsidiary undertakings is taken directly to reserves.
Deferred and contingent consideration is accounted for at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Costs directly attributable to business combinations are charged to the income statement as incurred and presented as one-off items.
During October 2015 the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Steritech, an independent pest control business and market leader in the provision of brand standards auditing services.
The acquisition strengthened the groups position as the third largest pest control business in both the US and Canada.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, where applicable.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 112 Notes to the Accounts The main categories of intangible assets are as follows: Intangible assets finite useful lives Intangible assets with finite useful lives are initially measured at either cost or fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The fair value attributable to intangible assets acquired through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to be generated from that asset at the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the group.
The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows: Customer lists and relationships 5 to 16 years Brands 2 to 15 years Product development up to 5 years Computer software 3 to 5 years The following are the main categories of intangible assets with finite useful lives: Customer lists and relationships Customer lists and portfolios acquired are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Separate values are not attributed to internally generated customer lists or relationships.
Brands Brands acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Expenditure incurred to develop, maintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an expense in the period incurred.
Separate values are not attributed to internally generated brands.
Product development Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility and only if the cost can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is available for use on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit.
Computer software Costs including employee and software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group which are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding cost beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets and amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Acquired computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring it into use, and is amortised over its estimated useful life.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.

Goodwill in respect of business combinations made since 1January 1998 is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on the acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates.
Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of subsidiaries made prior to 1January 1998 remains eliminated against reserves.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses previously recognised are not reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
A summary of the 2015 goodwill allocation by reportable segment is shown in the table on page 112.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations, using cash flow projections, and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and long-range plans approved by management and the board covering a three-year period, which is prepared as part of the groups normal planning process.
Cash flows for years four and five use managements expectation of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
It can be demonstrated that there is material headroom in the recoverable amount of the CGU goodwill balances based on the assumptions made.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 1% and 5% 2014: 2% and 5% and pre-tax discount rates of between 8% and 15% 2014: 10% and 14%.
The key assumptions used by the US Pest Control CGU were a long-term growth rate of 2% 2014: 3% and a pre-tax discount rate of 8% 2014: 9%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
During the year goodwill of 2.2m related to European businesses was impaired.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation with the exception of freehold land and assets under construction which are not depreciated.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
A breakdown of property, plant and equipment is shown below: Service Other plant Vehicles Land and contract and and office 2015 2014 buildings equipment equipment equipment Total Total m m m m m m Cost At 1 January 144.6 639.7 233.7 202.8 1.220.8 1,365.9 Exchange differences 7.7 38.5 13.5 7.6 67.3 66.5 Additions 4.2 129.5 12.9 21.2 167.8 178.9 Disposals 5.1 95.8 2.4 19.8 123.1 229.1 Acquisition of companies and businesses 0.2 0.4 5.1 5.7 8.0 Disposal of companies and businesses 0.1 0.1 36.4 At 31 December 136.2 634.9 231.1 201.6 1,203.8 1,220.8 Accumulated depreciation and impairment At 1 January 41.0 394.3 158.9 121.1 715.3 828.8 Exchange differences 2.5 24.7 9.4 4.9 41.5 41.8 Disposals 2.3 93.8 2.2 18.4 116.7 222.2 Acquisition of companies and businesses 3.1 Disposal of companies and businesses 0.1 0.1 28.3 Impairment 3.5 1.9 1.7 0.3 7.4 Depreciation charge 4.4 115.9 14.4 27.6 162.3 175.7 At 31 December 44.1 393.6 163.4 125.6 726.7 715.3 Net book value At 1 January 103.6 245.4 74.8 81.7 505.5 537.1 At 31 December 92.1 241.3 67.7 76.0 477.1 505.5 Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 114 Notes to the Accounts Depreciation of assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between their cost and their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 to 100 years Leasehold buildings shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life Vehicles 4 to 5 years Plant and equipment including service contract equipment 3 to 10 years Office equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and amended as necessary.
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the higher of its fair value less cost to sell or value-in-use.
For the purposes of assessing value-in-use, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units and cash flow forecasts are made using assumptions consistent with the most up-to-date budgets and plans that have been formally approved by management.
These cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based on the weighted average cost of capital for the group, adjusted for the particular risks of the cash-generating unit being reviewed for impairment.
When assets are sold, the difference between sale proceeds and net book value is recognised in the income statement.
The category of service contract equipment represents the pool of assets used by the group in delivering contracted services to customers.
Land and buildings comprise mainly factories and offices.
Finance leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases, where ownership of the asset will not pass to the group, is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
Where ownership will pass to the group the asset is always depreciated over its useful life.
The net carrying amounts of assets held under finance leases are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Vehicles and office equipment 24.0 23.0 Other plant and equipment 0.2 0.4 Total 24.2 23.4 B4.

Financing Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument, and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial assets At initial recognition the group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
This classification is re-evaluated at every reporting date and an assessment is made as to whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired.
All financial assets are held at amortised cost except for derivatives and certain assets classified as available-for-sale, which are held at fairvalue.
Financial assets are classified in the following categories: a Financial assets at fair value through the income statement These assets are included in current assets unless they are expected to be realised after 12 months from the balance sheet date, in which case they are classified as non-current assets.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the group provides goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included in current assets except for maturities later than 12 months from the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, subject to impairment.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are recognised in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the asset within 12months of the balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale assets are fair-valued and changes to market values are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On subsequent disposal or impairment, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement.
At each balance sheet date the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets are impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
d Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that the group intends and is able to hold to maturity.
They do not meet the definition of loans and receivables and are not designated on initial recognition as assets at fair value through the income statement or as available-for-sale.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading except where they qualify for hedge accounting and are held at fair value.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, vacant property provisions, deferred consideration and borrowings.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction the group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 117 Notes to the Accounts Certain financial instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Typically the group will not designate financial instruments for hedge accounting where a perfect or near perfect offset is expected between the change in value of assets and liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments in this category are immediately recognised in the incomestatement.
Where financial instruments are designated for hedge accounting they are designated as either: a Fair value hedge These instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Net investment hedge These instruments are used to hedge exposure on translation of net investments in foreign operations.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In the event of disposal of a foreign operation, the gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement.
c Cash flow hedge These instruments are used to hedge a highly probable forecast transaction or a change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement.
The gains or losses that are recognised in comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
In the event the hedged item occurs or is no longer expected to occur, accumulated gains or losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately recognised in the income statement.
In the event the hedged item is expected to occur but no longer meets the requirements of hedge accounting, accumulated gains or losses remain in other comprehensive income and are only recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.
Fair value estimation All financial instruments held at fair value are classified by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The following hierarchy is used: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices: Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The group uses the following methods to estimate fair value of its financial instruments: Financial instrument Hierarchy level Valuation method Financial assets traded in active markets 1 Current bid price Financial liabilities traded in active markets 1 Current ask price Long-term debt 1 Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments Interest rate currency swaps 1 Market swap rates at the balance sheet date Forward foreign exchange contracts 1 Forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date Borrowings not traded in active markets 2 Cash flows discounted at current market rates Financial instruments not traded in active markets 2 or 3 Valuation assumptions based on market conditions at the balance sheet date Trade payables and receivables 3 Nominal value less estimated credit adjustments Other financial instruments 3 Variety of techniques including discounted cash flows The tables below compare the fair value and carrying amounts for financial assets and liabilities excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables which are disclosed in section A of the notes.
The table also reconciles the groups accounting categorisation of financial assets and liabilities based on initial recognition to the classes of assets and liabilities as shown on the face of the balance sheet.

Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and subject to insignificant changes in value.
In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Included within cash at bank and in hand is 12.3m 2014: 9.1m of restricted cash.
This cash is held in respect of specific contracts and can only be utilised in line with terms under the contractual arrangements.
The group operates pooling arrangements whereby cash balances and overdrafts held within the same bank are offset to give a net balance which is included within cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.
These cash and bank overdraft figures before netting are shown in the table below: Offsetting financial assets and liabilities Gross amounts Gross before amounts Net amounts offsetting set off presented m m m At 31 December 2015 Cash at bank and in hand 560.9 464.2 96.7 Short-term bank deposits 5.9 5.9 Cash and short-term deposits 566.8 464.2 102.6 Bank overdraft 466.3 464.2 2.1 Cash and cash equivalents 100.5 100.5 At 31 December 2014 Cash at bank and in hand 1,107.8 970.9 136.9 Short-term bank deposits 60.2 60.2 Cash and short-term deposits 1,168.0 970.9 197.1 Bank overdraft 973.9 970.9 3.0 Cash and cash equivalents 194.1 194.1 Credit interest rates on bank balances range between 0.0% and 7.0% and debit interest rates range between 0.0% and 2.5%.
As far as it is practical to do so, cash balances are held centrally and are used first to repay borrowings under the groups Revolving Credit Facility before being placed on deposit.
Bank and other borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group hasa continuing right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
The groups bank debt comprises a Revolving Credit Facility RCF and a Term Loan which are both classified as non-current.
On 27 January 2015 the group signed a 315m RCF.
This facility is available for cash drawings up to 270m and for guarantees and letters of credit upto 45m.
The original maturity date was January 2020, but since the balance sheet date an option to extend the maturity date to January 2021 was granted.
The facility incorporates a further option to extend the facility to January 2022.
At the year end there were no drawings under the part of the facility available for cash drawings, and 29.7m of the part available for guarantees was utilised.
On 31 August 2015 the group signed a Term Loan available for cash drawings up to 200m and $157m, with a maturity date of December 2018.
At the year end 198.6m 130m and $102m was drawn.
The cost of borrowing under the groups bank facilities at the year end was 1.44%.
The committed borrowing facilities are subject to guarantees by Rentokil Initial 1927 plc.

The main financial risks faced by the group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates, and credit risks relating to the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions.
The management of these risks is set out below.
Capital risk The group is committed to maintaining a debt equity structure which allows continued access to a broad range of financing sources and sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities as they present themselves, without onerous financing terms and conditions.
The groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Capital consists of ordinary shares, retained earnings and non-controlling interests in the group.
Management monitors the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
Debt credit rating The groups debt is rated by Standard & Poors as BBB with a negative outlook.
The group targets a rating of BBB or above for debt issuance over the medium term.
A rating of BBBor above is considered an investment grade rating.
All of the groups 50m Euribor 0.48% bond, maturing 13 March 2018: 500m 3.375% bond, maturing 24 September 2019: and 350m 3.25% bond, maturing 7 October 2021, issued under its Medium-Term Note Programme see Note C2 for details, contain a coupon step-up increasing the coupon payable by 1.25% in the event that the group is downgraded to BB or below sub-investment grade.
Financial covenants The group has an RCF and a Term Loan see Note C2 for details.
The groups RCF and Term Loan contain covenants requiring that EBITDA:Interest should be at least 4.0:1.0 and that Net Debt:Adjusted EBITDA should be no greater than 3.5:1.0 at each semi-annual reporting date.
Change of control The groups Medium-Term Notes may be recalled by their investors at par in the event of a change of control of the group.
They may also be recalled within 120 days if the groups debt is downgraded below investment grade, or if the rating is withdrawn and the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or to the issuer or the Trustee, that the rating action occurred either wholly or in part due to the change of control.
Liquidity risk The group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due.
To achieve this, and in accordance with the liquidity ratio requirements of Standard & Poors, significant maturities are financed at least 12 months in advance, either through existing cash balances, forecast cash flows or new debt issuance.
Management models financing requirements at least 12 months ahead and aims to maintain average headroom of at least 150m and minimum headroom of at least 100m.
At 31 December 2015, the groups earliest maturity was the 300m bond due March 2016.
The group had available funds held centrally to meet this of 125m, and 377m of undrawn available committed headroom under its RCF and Term Loan giving combined headroom of 502m 2014: 460m combined available funds and headroom.
Market risk Interest rate risk The group has limited sensitivity to interest rate movements as the majority of floating-rate borrowings are swapped to fixed rates, and modest cash balances are forecast for 2016.
A hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro and sterling interest rates would reduce the market value of the groups bond liabilities by 32m at 31 December 2015.
The income statement impact is nil as changes in interest rates do not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.
The group had outstanding debt issues at 31 December 2015 with a fair market value of 1,016.4m.
This exceeds the book value of 972.3m as a result of reductions in interest rates in the UK and Europe and improved investor credit appetite.
There are no circumstances where the group would be forced to pay the fair market value.
The group could however decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early and the fair market value is indicative of the price that would be required to do so.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 122 Notes to the Accounts Foreign exchange risk The groups worldwide operations generate profits and cash flows in foreign currencies.
Sales and purchases are typically denominated in the same currency and the groups cross-border procurement is considered insignificant.
Sterling procurement and central costs mean that foreign currencies constitute more than 100% of group adjusted profit before interest, tax and amortisation APBITA at approximately 113%.
The groups primary exposure is the exchange rate, with euro APBITA making up 62% of group APBITA.
The next most significant currency group is US dollars forming approximately 20% of group APBITA.
Emerging market currencies contribute approximately 12% of APBITA and other currencies, including the Australian dollar and Nordic currencies, contribute approximately 19%.
Following the acquisition of Steritech, it is anticipated that the US dollar exposure will become similar in proportion to the euro.
At 31 December 2015 the groups net debt was approximately 57% euro 2014: 80% reflecting that it is the groups principal cash flow exposure and the low cost of euro funding : and 44% US dollars 2014: 20% reflecting the size of the US market and the groups strong growth and investment in this region.
The translation of the interest element of euro and US dollar debt provides a partial income statement offset to the translation of earnings.
The group calculates the impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates.
The groups principal foreign currency exposure is to euro.
A 10% movement in would result in a 13.3m increase decrease 2014: 17.6m in adjusted operating profit, offset by a 1.9m decrease increase 2014: 2.4m in interest payable.
For US dollars, a 10% movement in $ would result in a 4.2m increase decrease 2014: 3.8m in adjusted operating profit, offset by a 0.9m decrease increase 2014: 0.8m in interest payable.
Where possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in preference to selling currency in the market.
Credit risk The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Sales are typically low-value, high-volume, spreading the risk across a number of customers.
Policies are in place to ensure that credit sales are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure to any single counterparty.
The group monitors the creditworthiness of its derivative counterparties using a combination of credit ratings and other market indicators.
The groups core bank group of nine counterparties were all rated Aor above by Standard & Poors.
In some territories, particularly in emerging markets, the group has exposure to some lower-rated banks who conduct limited local cash management.
At 31 December 2015 the group had a total of 35.3m deposited with banks rated below Aby Standard & Poors of which 25.0m was covered by the German Governments Bankverband.
The highest concentration with any single bank not covered by a government guarantee was 2.2m.
The group operates in some territories where there is increased exposure to trade credit risks and in those cases the group puts in place appropriate additional measures to manage its credit exposure.
Treasury risk The Company utilises financial instruments to manage known financial exposures in line with policies agreed by the Board and outlined above, and does not enter into any speculative derivative contracts.
Other investments Other investments include deposits placed with counterparty banks receiving interest at a rate of 1.0% 2014: 1.0% per annum.
Other investments held at year end comprised term deposits maturing in more than three months from the date that the deposit was placed.
95.0m of other investments held at 31 December 2015 mature ahead of the repayment of the 300m bond payable in March 2016.
Fixed-rate cash deposits include short-term deposits of 95.0m held centrally 2014: 48.7m.
Fixed-rate cash deposits also include 1.5m 2014: 1.4m invested with counterparty banks which are held by the groups insurance operations in accordance with local insurance regulations.
These deposits are used to meet insurance liabilities as they fall due.
The weighted average effective interest rate earned is 1.0% 2014: 1.0% and the weighted average rate was fixed for 1.0 years 2014: 1.0 years.
Financial assets are denominated in the following currencies: 2015 2014 m m Pounds sterling 96.5 50.1 Euro 0.1 0.1 Other 2.8 1.3 99.4 51.5 None of the financial assets are either past due or impaired in 2015 or 2014.

Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to derivatives marked as cash flow hedge in the following table in accordance with IAS 39.
Where nohedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have been marked as non-hedge.
Any ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedge is taken directly to finance costs.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges or those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship.
Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to 54.4m of the 500m 2019 bond using cross-currency interest rate swaps which match the terms ofthe bond: to NOK 105m of intercompany loans using cross-currency interest rate swaps matching the terms of the loans: and to the 50m bond maturing in March 2018 using an interest rate swap maturing at the same date as the bond to fix the interest cash flows.
The purpose of these hedges is to eliminate the risk to the cash flow due to changes in the and NOK exchange rate and to changes in interest rates.
The group raised a three-year Term Loan with a floating interest rate on 31 August 2015, maturing in December 2018.
On 30 September 2015, 198.6m was drawn and the interest cash flow has been swapped to fixed using vanilla swaps: cash flow hedge accounting has been applied.
The balance in comprehensive income in regards to cash flow hedge accounting was 0.2m gain 2014: 0.1m loss.

Interest receivable Interest income is recognised on a time-apportioned basis using the effective interest method.
When a receivable is impaired the group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income.
Interest income on impaired loans is recognised either as cash is collected or on a cost-recovery basis as conditions warrant.
