AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 149 Financial Statements 2 Operating profit Operating profit includes the following significant items: Research and development expense In 2013, research and development included a reversal of the intangible asset impairment charge of $285m, booked in 2011 for Lynparza olaparib.
Selling, general and administrative costs In 2015, selling, general and administrative costs includes a credit of $378m 2014: charge of $529m resulting from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of the diabetes alliance with BMS.
These adjustments reflect revised estimates for future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, revised estimates for future royalties payable.
In 2015, selling, general and administrative costs also include a total of $313m of legal provisions relating to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions in relation to several marketed products.
In July 2014, the US Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations that affected the recognition of the annual Branded Pharmaceutical Fee, imposed by the health care reform legislation in 2010.
As a result, entities covered by the legislation now accrue for the obligation as each sale occurs.
AstraZeneca recorded a catch-up charge of $226m in 2014 to reflect this new basis, $113m of which was recorded in selling, general and administrative costs and $113m as a deduction from revenue.
In 2013, selling, general and administrative costs included an intangible asset impairment charge of $1,620m against Bydureon following revised estimates for future sales performance.

Excluding these effects, the reported tax rate for the year was 22%.
The cash tax paid for the year was $1,354m which was 44% of profit before tax.
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements.
The 2015 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to a $186m tax benefit following agreement of US federal tax liabilities of open years to 2008, netreductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $259m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2014 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to a reduction in provisions for tax contingencies, including a benefit of $117m arising from the inter-governmental agreement of a transfer pricing matter, partially offset by tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2013 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies partially offset by tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2015, 2014 and 2013 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double tax relief if distributed as dividends.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $6,957m at 31December 2015 2014: $6,128m: 2013: $6,196m.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
In 2015, the UK Government substantively enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax to 18% by 2020.
Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 27.

The 2014 and 2013 items relate to the reduction in the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 23% to the rate of tax of 20% effective from 1 April 2015.
2 Other items in 2015 included the impact of internal transfers of intellectual property tax charge of $181m and the release of certain tax contingencies following the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations tax credit of $256m.
Other items in 2014 included the impact of internal transfers of intellectual property including recognition of deferred tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination tax charge of $304m, and the release of certain tax contingencies following the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations tax credits of $297m.
3 Further detail explaining the adjustments in respect of prior periods is set out above.
AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK.
The impact of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Groups overall tax charge is noted above.
Profits arising from our manufacturing operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax incentive grant continuing until 2031.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 153 Financial Statements 6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
AstraZenecas biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
All of these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
These individual functional areas are not managed separately.
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of our business.
It is considered that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
In addition to the CEO, CFO, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, the SET comprises nine Executive Vice-Presidents representing IMED, MedImmune, Global Medicines Development, North America, Europe, International, GPPS, Operations & Information Services, and Human Resources.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SEThave responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole.
Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation.
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Early Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee.
Geographic areas The following tables show information by geographic area and, for Total Revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries.
The figures show the Total Revenue, operating profit and profit before tax made by companies located in that area country, together with segment assets, segment assets acquired, net operating assets, and property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies: export sales and the related profit are included in the area country where the legal entity resides and from which those sales were made.

The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Groups pre-tax cash flows over 10 years which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets, our knowledge ofcompetitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10-year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use.
No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist.
The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects.
For each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2015, 2014 and 2013 to reflect the impact ofrisks relevant to that group of assets, the time value of money and tax effects.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 10% 2014: 10%: 2013: 10%.
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 31December 2015 and 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied.
The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

Impairment charges and reversals In 2015 and 2014, impairment charges relate to the termination, or reassessment of the likelihood of success, of several individual projects, none of which had significant capitalised values.
In 2013, AstraZeneca commenced enrolment of the first patient in the first of several Phase III clinical programmes for Lynparza olaparib.
As a result of the initiation of this programme, an impairment charge of $285m, taken in 2011, was reversed and the full historic carrying value of the asset restored to the balance sheet.
There are several indications currently under development for Lynparza olaparib and, at the date of the reversal of the impairment, the recoverable value of the intangible asset relating to Lynparza olaparib determined using value in use calculations as detailed below, was estimated to be at least $650m above its carrying value.
The 2013 impairment charge of product, marketing and distribution rights included a charge of $1,758m against the intangible asset for Bydureon, acquired as part of the 2012 collaboration with BMS on Amylin products, following revised estimates for future sales performance that were below AstraZenecas commercial expectations at that time of entering into the collaboration.
Impairment charges also included $136m following AstraZenecas decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 159 Financial Statements 9 Intangible assets continued The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of R&D activities, were determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products expected post-tax cash flows over aperiod reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2015, 2014 and 2013 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 13% 2014: 13%: 2013: 13%.
By their nature, the value in use calculations are sensitive to the underlying methods, assumptions and estimates.
Consistent with prior years, as part of the impairment review process, management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions may cause the carrying amount of the intangible assets to exceed the recoverable amount.
At 31December 2015, the Group held intangible assets for products in development of $8,732m 2014: $6,598m: 2013: $5,457m, for which the most sensitive assumption is the probability of technical success, and intangible assets for launched products of $13,504m 2014: $13,915m: 2013: $9,969m, for which the most sensitive assumptions are the projected market share of the therapeutic area and expected pricing.
In addition, we consider the sensitivity of our 2015 impairment conclusions to possible changes to the post tax discount rate and noted that a change of 1% would have no effect on the level of impairment recorded in 2015.
Given their nature, impairment adjustments triggered by future events that have yet to occur may be material.
In addition, there is a significant risk that impairments recognised in any one period may be subject to material adjustments in future periods.

Equity securities and bonds available for sale, and equity securities held for trading, are held at fair value.
The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, cost is considered to approximate to fair value.
Fixed deposits are held at amortised cost with carrying value being areasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.
None of the financial assets or liabilities have been reclassified in the year.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments, contained within other investments and carried at fair value, by valuation method.
Thedifferent levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ieasprices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash flow accounting models using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows.

The resulting modified royalty structure, which includes fixed minimum and maximum payments in years until 2020, has resulted in the Company recognising liabilities, and corresponding prepayments, for the discounted value of total minimum payments.
The current portion of the prepayment is $260m 2014: $323m: 2013: $350m and is reported in amounts due within one year see Note 15.
Non-current other receivables also include prepayments in relation to our research collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics.

3 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,327m 2014: $1,453m: 2013: $1,608m held at amortised cost.
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value: this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
Allother loans are held at amortised cost.
Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to carrying values.
A gain of $10m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to increased credit risk.
A gain of $48m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $288m.

Revaluations of contingent consideration are recognised in selling, general and administrative costs and include a decrease of $378m in 2015 2014: an increase of $529m based on revised milestone probabilities, and revenue and royalty forecasts, relating to the acquisition of BMSs share of the Global Diabetes Alliance.

Management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions including the likelihood of achieving successful trial results, obtaining regulatory approval, the projected market share of the therapeutic area and expected pricing for launched products may cause the calculated fair value of the above contingent consideration to vary materially in future years.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 165 Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where AstraZenecas contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US, Sweden and Germany, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over one, three or five years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through separate,  funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZenecas credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles 97% of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2015 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany.
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Groups core business.
The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Group would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles.
This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities.
To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield.
At present, this puts a different, lower value on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK With regard to the Groups UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements summarised below and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
Role of Trustees UK The UK Pension Fund is managed by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustee Directors are composed of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director.
The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund see below.
Funding requirements UK UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently ie to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
On a triennial basis the Trustee and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Fund is fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure.
The last funding valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2013.
Anupdated funding valuation is due as at 31 March 2016.
In addition, AstraZeneca makes contributions to a separate account which is held outside the UK Pension Fund.
The assets held in this account will be payable to the AstraZeneca Pension Fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy.
At 31 December 2015, 315m $467m of assets held in this separate account are included within other investments see Note 11.
The structure of this separate account is a custody account held by AstraZeneca with HSBC.
There is a charge in favour of the Pension Fund Trustee over the assets held in this custody account.
Under the current funding plan, a lump sum contribution of 196m $305m was made towards the deficit in January 2015, with a further contribution of 51m $76m due before 31 March 2016.
Contributions are made by transferring assets from the custody account described above.
The Company and the UK Pension Fund are currently exploring revised funding plans and extended target dates for full funding.
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2013 were as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.55% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010, pension increases at 3.2% per annum and investment returns at 4.86% per annum.
The resulting valuation of the Funds liabilities on that basis were 4,887m $7,241m compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2013 of 4,394m $6,510m.
166 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to AstraZeneca by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the fund.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC14 IAS19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Regulation UK The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.
Rest of Group The IAS19 positions as at 31December 2015 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans.
These plans account for 90% of the Groups defined benefit obligations outside the UK.
The US and Sweden pension funds are managed by fiduciary bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds.
These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2015, when plan obligations were $1,794m and plan assets were $1,566m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2015, when plan obligations were estimated toamount to $1,423m and plan assets were $1,045m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2015.
In accordance with practice in Germany, the plan has a low level of funding: plan obligations amounted to $345m and plan assets were $19m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions during the year ending 31December 2016 for the four main countries will be $173m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2015, some 3,433 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 10,582 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2015 was $23m 2014: $20m: 2013: $16m.
Plan assets were $293m and plan obligations were $318m at 31 December 2015.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2015.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2015 2014 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.0% 2.1% 3.1% 2.0% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.0% 3.2% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% 0.8% 3.0% 0.8% Discount rate 3.8% 3.8% 3.5% 3.0% 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2015 and members expected to retire in 2035 2014: 2014 and 2034 respectively.
Life expectancy assumption for a male member retiring at age 65 Country 2015 2035 2014 2034 UK 23.2 24.5 23.7 25.3 US 22.9 24.4 23.1 24.7 Sweden 20.5 22.4 20.5 22.4 Germany 18.7 21.5 18.7 21.5 The UK life expectancy has fallen over the year due to a higher-than-expected number of pensioner-age deaths in the UK over 2014 15, compared to the prior year assumptions.
This has created the expectation of a less rapid rate of longevity improvement in future years, which has been reflected by the Company by adopting the CMI 2015 Mortality Projections Model with a 1% long-term improvement rate in 2015.

In 2015, AstraZeneca decided to no longer convert assets held in the Investment Account section into the defined benefit section, as members reached retirement.
As a result, settlements within the year include $447m relating to the Investment Account being removed from both the UK assets and liabilities with a net impact of $nil on the overall deficit.
Past service cost in 2015 includes a credit to operating income of $21m arising from the reduction of the pre-65 maximum annual cost of medical coverage in the US retiree health plans.
Group costs in respect of defined contribution schemes during the year were $302m 2014: $238m.
Past service cost relates predominantly to enhanced pensions on early retirement in the UK and Sweden.

2 Of the $313m increase, $207m is covered by the longevity swap.
3 Of the $314m decrease, $214m is covered by the longevity swap.
The sensitivity to the financial assumptions shown above has been estimated taking into account the approximate duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of the plan membership.
The sensitivity to the life expectancy assumption has been estimated based on the distribution of the plan cash flows.

172 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Financial Statements 24 Acquisitions of business operations 2015 Acquisitions ZS Pharma On 17 December, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of ZS Pharma, a biopharmaceutical company based in San Mateo, California.
ZSPharma uses its proprietary ion-trap technology to develop novel treatments for hyperkalaemia, a serious condition of elevated potassium in the bloodstream, typically associated with chronic kidney disease CKD and chronic heart failure CHF.
The acquisition gives AstraZeneca access to the potassium-binding compound ZS-9, a potential best-in-class treatment for hyperkalaemia, which is under regulatory review by the US Food and Drug Administration with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of 26May 2016.
Asubmission for European Marketing Application Authorisation was made late in 2015.
ZS Pharma represents a strong fit with AstraZenecas pipeline and portfolio in Cardiovascular and Metabolic disease, one of the Companys three main therapy areas.
AstraZenecas strategy focuses on reducing morbidity, mortality and organ damage by addressing multiple risk factors across cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
ZS-9 complements the Companys increasing focus on CKD and CHF, including the investigational medicine roxadustat, which is currently in Phase III development for patients with anaemia associated with CKD, as well as its leading diabetes portfolio.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca has acquired 100% of the share capital of ZS Pharma for $90 per share in an all-cash transaction, or approximately $2.7bn in aggregate transaction value.
ZS Pharma has around 200 employees across three sites in California, Texas and Colorado.
The combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to research and development and manufacturing, requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Goodwill is principally attributable to the commercial synergies AstraZeneca expects to be able to realise upon launch of ZS-9, the value of the specialist knowhow inherent in the acquired workforce and the accounting for deferred taxes.
Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
ZS Pharmas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 17 December 2015.
From the period from acquisition to 31December 2015, ZS Pharmas revenues and loss were immaterial.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2015, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2015 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $2,702m.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1January 2015 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
Given the proximity of the completion of the transaction to the date the Financial Statements were approved, the finalisation of the accounting entries for this transaction has yet to be completed.

The acquisition provided AstraZeneca with 100% ownership of the intellectual property and global rights for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of the diabetes business, including Onglyza saxagliptin, Kombiglyze XR saxagliptin and metformin HCl extended release, Komboglyze saxagliptin and metformin HCl, Farxiga dapagliflozin, marketed as Forxiga outside the US, Byetta exenatide, Bydureon exenatide extended release for injectable suspension, Myalept metreleptin and Symlin pramlintide acetate.
The transaction consolidated worldwide ownership of the diabetes business within AstraZeneca, leveraging its primary and specialty care capabilities and its geographical reach, especially in emerging markets.
The transaction included the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the asset purchase of the additional intellectual property and global rights not already owned by AstraZeneca, for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze and Farxiga, including associated BMS employees.
This combination of intangible product rights and manufacturing assets with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the global manufacturing and selling and marketing operations, required that the acquisition be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS3.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $2.7bn was paid on 1February 2014, with further payments of up to $1.4bn being payable for future regulatory, launch and sales-related milestones as well as various sales-related royalty payments up until 2025.
The amount of royalties payable under the agreement is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and the range of outcomes cannot be reliably estimated.
The maximum amount payable in each year is with reference to net sales.
AstraZeneca also agreed to make payments up to $225m when certain additional assets are transferred.
Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision-tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of future revenues.
In accordance with IFRS3, the fair value of contingent consideration, including future royalties, was recognised immediately as a liability.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a Swedish krona functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the US dollar denominated contingent consideration.
To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Groups underlying US dollar net investments.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
In addition to the acquired interests, AstraZeneca entered into certain agreements with BMS to maintain the manufacturing and supply chain of the full portfolio of diabetes products and to deliver specified clinical trials with an agreed number of R&D and manufacturing employees dedicated to diabetes remaining with BMS to progress the diabetes portfolio and support the transition for these areas.
Payments by AstraZeneca to BMS in relation to these arrangements are expensed as incurred.
No amounts were recognised in the initial acquisition accounting in relation to these arrangements but were separated, at fair value, from the business combination accounting.
The terms of the agreement partially reflected settlement of the launch and sales-related milestones under the pre-existing Onglyza and Farxiga collaboration agreements, which were terminated in relation to the acquisition.
The expected value of those pre-existing milestones was $0.3bn and was recognised as a separate component of consideration and excluded from the business combination accounting.
Subsequently, these separate intangible assets have been recognised.
Goodwill of $1,530m arising on the transaction is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these are the synergies AstraZeneca expects to be able to generate through more efficient manufacturing processes and the incremental value accessible through strategic and operational independence upon taking full control of the alliance.
Goodwill of $1.5bn is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value of receivables acquired as part of the acquisition approximated the gross contractual amounts receivable.
There were no significant amounts which were not expected to be collected.
The results from the additional acquired interests in the diabetes alliance were consolidated into the Groups results from 1February 2014, which added revenue of $895m in the period to 31 December 2014.
Due to the highly integrated nature of the diabetes alliance, and the fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the additional acquired interest are not separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,174m.
As detailed above, it is impracticable to disclose a pro forma profit after tax.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2014 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
Almirall On 31 October 2014, the Group completed the agreement with Almirall to transfer the rights to Almiralls respiratory franchise to AstraZeneca.
The transaction provided AstraZeneca with 100% of the rights for the development and commercialisation of Almiralls existing proprietary respiratory business, including rights to revenues from Almiralls existing collaborations, as well as its pipeline of investigational novel therapies.
The franchise includes Eklira aclidinium : Duaklir Genuair, the combination of aclidinium with formoterol which had been filed for registration in the EU and developed in the US EU approval received in November 2014 : LAS100977 abediterol, a once-daily long-acting betaagonist LABA 2 in Phase II: an M3 antagonist betaagonist MABA platform in pre-clinical development LAS191351, LAS194871 and Phase I LAS190792 : 2 and multiple pre-clinical programmes.
Almirall Sofotec, an Almirall subsidiary focused on the development of innovative proprietary devices, also transferred to AstraZeneca.
In addition, Almirall employees dedicated to the respiratory business, including Almirall Sofotec employees, transferred to AstraZeneca.
174 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Financial Statements 24 Acquisitions of business operations continued Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $878m was paid in November 2014, with further payments of up to $1.22bn being payable for future development, launch, and sales-related milestones.
AstraZeneca also agreed to make various sales-related payments.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a pounds sterling functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the contingent consideration.
To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge.
Almiralls pipeline of novel respiratory assets and its device capabilities further strengthen AstraZenecas Respiratory portfolio, which includes Symbicort and Pulmicort, as well as the investigational medicines in development.
The addition of aclidinium and the combination of aclidinium with formoterol, both in proprietary Genuair device, allows AstraZeneca to offer patients a choice between dry powder inhaler and metereddose inhaler devices across a range of molecules and combinations.
The combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the selling and marketing operations, requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS3.
Goodwill of $311m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the premium attributable to the significant competitive advantage associated with AstraZenecas complementary portfolio and that attributable to a highly skilled workforce.
Goodwill of $0.3bn is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Almiralls respiratory franchise results were consolidated into the Groups results from 31 October 2014.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2014, Almiralls respiratory franchise revenues were $13m.
Due to the highly integrated nature of the respiratory franchise, and the fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the acquired interest are not separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,198m.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1January 2014 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
Definiens On 25 November 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Definiens Group, a privately-held German company focused on imaging and data analysis technology, known as Tissue Phenomics, which dramatically improves the identification of biomarkers in tumour tissue.
Definiens technology provides detailed cell-by-cell readouts from target structures on tissue slides and allows the correlation of this information with data derived from other sources, generating new knowledge and supporting better decisions in research, diagnostics and therapy.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Definiens shares for an upfront consideration of $150m and contingent consideration of up to $150m based on reaching three predetermined development milestones.
Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision-tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
Definiens results were consolidated into the Groups results from 25 November 2014.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2014, Definiens revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenues, and its loss after tax was immaterial.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been unchanged and the change in profit after tax would have been immaterial.

2013 acquisitions Pearl Therapeutics On 27 June 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics.
Pearl Therapeutics is based in Redwood City, California, and is focused on the development of inhaled small molecule therapeutics for respiratory disease.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Pearl Therapeutics shares for an upfront consideration of $569m.
In addition, consideration of up to $450m is payable if specified development and regulatory milestones in respect of any triple combination therapies and selected future products that AstraZeneca develops using Pearl Therapeutics technology platform are achieved.
Sales-related payments of up to a further $140m are payable if pre-agreed cumulative sales thresholds are exceeded.
Goodwill of $44m was recorded for the acquisition and is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the synergistic benefit generated by acquiring Pearl Therapeutics workforce, whose skills and knowhow are critical to the best and most efficient completion of the ongoing development programmes.
Pearl Therapeutics results were consolidated into the Groups results from 27 June 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2013, Pearl Therapeutics revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $49m.
Omthera Pharmaceuticals On 18July 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Omthera is a specialty pharmaceutical company based in Princeton, New Jersey, focused on the development and commercialisation of new therapies for abnormal levels of lipids in the blood, referred to as dyslipidaemia.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Omtheras shares for an upfront consideration of $323m with up to $120m in future development and approval milestones.
Omtheras results were consolidated into the Groups results from 18July 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2013, Omtheras revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $10m.
Amplimmune On 4 October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Amplimmune, a privately-held, Maryland, US-based biologics company focused on developing novel therapeutics in cancer immunology.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Amplimmunes shares for an initial consideration of $225m and deferred consideration of up to $275m based on reaching predetermined development milestones.
The acquisition bolsters AstraZenecas Oncology pipeline by obtaining multiple early-stage assets for its immune-mediated cancer therapy IMT-C portfolio, including AMP-514, an anti-programmed cell death 1 PD-1 monoclonal antibody MAb.
Other Amplimmune assets include multiple preclinical molecules targeting the B7 pathways.
Goodwill of $33m arising on the acquisition is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified, but include Amplimmunes very early programmes of potential interest for oncology, immunology and infectious diseases, as well as research tools and animal models.
Amplimmunes results were consolidated into the Groups results from 4October 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2013, Amplimmunes revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $5m.
176 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Financial Statements 24 Acquisitions of business operations continued Spirogen On 15October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Spirogen, a privately-held biotech company focused on antibody drug conjugate technology for use in oncology.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Spirogens shares for an initial consideration of $200m and deferred consideration of up to $240m based on reaching predetermined development milestones.
Existing out-licensing agreements and associated revenue streams were excluded from this acquisition.
AstraZeneca also entered into a collaboration agreement with ADC Therapeutics to jointly develop two of ADC Therapeutics antibody-drug conjugate programmes in preclinical development.
AstraZeneca also made an equity investment in ADC Therapeutics, which has an existing licensing agreement with Spirogen.
Spirogens results were consolidated into the Groups results from 15October 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2013, Spirogens revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was immaterial.

This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1January 2013 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from itsoperations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, currency options, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options or as part of a risk management strategy.
The Group is not a net seller of options, and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note22, debt Note17 and cash Note16.
For the foreseeable future, theBoard will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
The Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables.
These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IAS 39.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 177 Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The Boards distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend and, subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
The Groups net debt position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has increased from a net debt position of $3,223m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $7,762m at 31December 2015, primarily as a result of increased outflows from investing activities, including acquisitions.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-2 by Moodys and A-2 by Standard and Poors.
The Groups long-term credit rating is A3 stable outlook by Moodys and Astable outlook by Standard and Poors.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $6,240m, fixed deposits of $65m, less overdrafts of $189m at 31 December 2015, the Group has committed bank facilities of $3bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31December 2015, the Group has issued $1,327m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $12,782m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities of $3bn mature in April 2020 and were undrawn at 31December 2015.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Groups financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows: Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative Crossderivative and other Finance and other financial Interest currency financial loans Bonds leases payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 993 1,217 34 10,370 12,614 70 16 86 12,528 In one to two years 1,482 33 1,044 2,559 70 16 86 2,473 In two to three years 393 31 660 1,084 51 16 67 1,017 In three to four years 2,143 18 285 2,446 51 16 67 2,379 In four to five years 290 3 230 523 51 15 66 457 In more than five years 10,497 1,010 11,507 77 229 306 11,201 993 16,022 119 13,599 30,733 370 308 678 30,055 Effect of interest 1 6,872 17 6,890 370 97 467 6,423 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 132 885 753 193 24 169 922 31 December 2013 992 9,282 102 12,714 23,090 193 187 380 22,710 Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative Crossderivative and other Finance and other financial Interest currency financial loans Bonds leases payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 1,488 1,490 45 11,909 14,932 52 16 68 14,864 In one to two years 401 45 1,720 2,166 52 16 68 2,098 In two to three years 2,151 31 936 3,118 52 16 68 3,050 In three to four years 298 8 924 1,230 16 19 35 1,195 In four to five years 1,298 1 1,323 2,622 16 325 341 2,281 In more than five years 10,135 7,002 17,137 62 62 17,075 1,488 15,773 130 23,814 41,205 250 392 642 40,563 Effect of interest 2 6,461 22 6,485 250 83 333 6,152 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 63 3,937 4,000 161 5 156 4,156 31 December 2014 1,486 9,249 108 19,877 30,720 161 304 465 30,255 178 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative Crossderivative and other Finance and other financial Interest currency financial loans Bonds leases payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 851 568 66 11,701 13,186 54 17 71 13,115 In one to two years 2,318 41 1,522 3,881 54 17 71 3,810 In two to three years 1,865 22 1,110 2,997 19 26 45 2,952 In three to four years 1,444 10 1,277 2,731 15 330 345 2,386 In four to five years 2,025 2 2,187 4,214 15 15 4,199 In more than five years 14,192 5,313 19,505 44 44 19,461 851 22,412 141 23,110 46,514 201 390 591 45,923 Effect of interest 2 8,194 46 8,242 201 67 268 7,974 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 109 3,990 4,099 126 3 123 4,222 31 December 2015 849 14,109 95 19,120 34,173 126 320 446 33,727 Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts, with the exception of $6,411m of contingent consideration held within other payables at fair value see Note 18.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune and entered into in 2015 in order to finance the acquisition of ZS Pharma has been held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.6bn, converting the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates, partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates and partially converting the 1.75% callable bond maturing in 2018 to floating rates.
The interest rate swap on the 2018 bond was entered into in 2015.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2014 or 2013.
At 31 December 2015, swaps with a notional value of $1.35bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $0.29bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 144.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31December 2015, 31December 2014 and 31December 2013, is set out below.
In the case of current and noncurrent financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 179 Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 60% of Group external sales in 2015 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
As at 31 December 2015, 3.4% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pound sterling and 5.4% of interestbearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
During 2013, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert the remaining un-hedged $250m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt.
This instrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Groups Japanese yen net assets.
In 2014, $125m of the Japanese yen cross-currency swap was fide-designated from the net investment hedge in order to maintain hedge effectiveness.
Also in 2013, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $151m into fixed Chinese renminbi debt maturing in 2018.
Thisinstrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Groups Chinese renminbi net assets.
Fairvalue movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness would be taken to profit.
Foreign currency risk arises where the Group has intercompany funding and investments in certain subsidiaries operating in countries with exchange controls.
The most significant risk in this respect is Venezuela, where the Group has approximately $98m equivalent of local currency cash, on which there have been delays in obtaining approval for remittance outside the country.
The official exchange rate for essential goods and services is VEF 6.3 $ as published by CENCOEX the National Foreign Trade Center.
However, alternative exchange rates exist and these include the SICAD Supplementary Foreign Currency Administration System rate and the SIMADI Sistema Marginal fide Divisas rate, which was introduced in 2015.
At 31December 2015, the SICAD rate was VEF 13.5 $ 31December 2014: VEF 12.0 $ and the SIMADI rate was VEF 199.7 $.
For the period to 31December 2015, the Group used the SICAD rate for the consolidation of the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries.
The Group believes that the SICAD rate represents the most appropriate rate for consolidation as it reflects their best expectation of the rate at which profits will be remitted.
Factors such as future uncertainty and significant delays experienced in remitting cash at the CENCOEX rate, as well as management actions in dealing with the government to settle a portion of the overdue receivables at the SICAD rate were taken into account.
If the Group were to use the SIMADI rate for the consolidation of the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries, the Group would be exposed to a potential income statement devaluation loss of $163m on its total intercompany balances with the subsidiaries in Venezuela and the local currency cash would be reduced to $7m on consolidation.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31December 2015, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31December 2015, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $30m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31December 2015, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
180 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes anallowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 84% of US sales 2014: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75%: 2013: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 77%.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2015 2014 2013 $m $m $m Not past due 4,388 4,316 5,059 Past due 0-90 days 189 354 330 Past due 90-180 days 21 75 78 Past due 180 days 35 17 47 4,633 4,762 5,514 2015 2014 2013 $m $m $m Movements in provisions for trade receivables At 1 January 54 64 64 Income statement 2 2 5 Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements 4 8 5 At 31 December 52 54 64 The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers.
Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 181 Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2015 was $4,389m invested in five AAA-rated liquidity funds.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
No more than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
At 31December 2015, the Group had investments of $1,050m 2014: $300m: 2013: $nil in short-term repurchase agreements, which are fully collateralised investments.
In the event of any default, ownership of the collateral would revert to the Group and would be readily convertible to cash.
The value of the collateral held at 31December 2015 was $1,098m 2014: $316m: 2013: $nil.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31December 2015 was $451m 2014: $457m: 2013: $326m.
26 Employee costs and share plans for employees Employee costs The average number of people, to the nearest hundred, employed by the Group is set out in the table below.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and marketrelated packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
182 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Financial Statements 26 Employee costs and share plans for employees continued Bonus plans The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance.
The Company also offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares Ordinary Shares.
Employees may invest up to 1,800 over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12-month period.
In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which was made in 2011.
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved All-Employee Share Plan.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
TheRemuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years.
The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET.
Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Sweden In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash.
There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 93 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $211m 2014: $178m: 2013: $156m.
The plans are equity settled.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations, including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31December 2015.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Risk section from page 212, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities The Groups expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Groups research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are not separated from overall operating and development costs.
There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2013, 2014 or 2015.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination.
In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc. and or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties PRPs or defendants at approximately 15 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes together, US Environmental Consequences.
Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC SMC, which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at 33 sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences.
AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US.
These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Groups business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Groups R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
With respect to such estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2015 in the aggregate of $67m 2014: $84m: 2013: $87m, mainly relating to the US.
Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation.
Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions.
The extent of such possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: 1 the nature and extent of claims that may be asserted in the future: 2 whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims: 3 the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known: 4 the potential for recoveries from or allocation of liability to third parties: and 5 the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation process can take.
Notwithstanding and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to be, in aggregate, between $71m and $119m 2014: $50m and $80m: 2013: $50m and $90m, which relates mainly to the US.
