The following companies are substantial shareholders in the Company and therefore a related party of the Company in each case, for the purposes of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The number of shares held on 18 February 2016 was as below: Shareholder No.
of shares % of voting rights Invesco Asset Management 53,674,295 8.08 Veritas Asset Management LLP 41,859,611 6.30 BlackRock Inc 37,899,583 5.70 Woodford Investment Management LLP 36,810,693 5.54 34 Group composition and non-controlling interests The Groups subsidiaries are listed in note 8 and note 19 of the parent company financial statements on pages 169 and 172 to 176.
This includes Axelos Limited and Entrust Limited which both have 49% non-controlling interests, and FERA which has a 25% non-controlling interest, none of whose contribution was material to the Groups financial performance, financial position or cash flow in both 2015 and 2014.
The Group holds a majority of the voting rights in all of these subsidiaries and the Directors have determined that, other than the entity commented on below, in each case the Group exercises fide facto control.
On 23 September 2014, the Secretary of State for the Department for Energy and Climate Change granted Smart DCC Ltd DCC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, a licence to establish and manage the smart metering communications infrastructure, governed by the Smart Energy Code.
Each year the Group reassess whether it has control over DCC as required under IFRS 10.
The Groups ability to control the relevant activities of DCC is restricted by DCCs operating licence.
The power that the Group has over DCCs relevant activities by virtue of owning it is limited given the restrictions in the license.
That power is held by the board of DCC where the Group has minority representation in compliance with the licence.
The Group has therefore not consolidated DCC within its Group accounts.
The disclosure of related party transactions with DCC is included in note 33 to these financial statements.
35 Post balance sheet event Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group disposed of 80.1% of the shares in a health business, Capita Medical Reporting Limited for a cash consideration of 1 and 20m deferred consideration.
The remaining 19.9% will be recorded as a financial asset as the Group does not retain any significant influence over the business.
