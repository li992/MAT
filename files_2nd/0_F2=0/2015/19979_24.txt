Strategic report Governance Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 121 11 Company financial statements continued 11.10 Pensions 11.10.1 CARE scheme The Company operates a dened benefit pension scheme CARE and a cash balance scheme.
The CARE scheme is called the Wm Morrison 1967 Pension Scheme and provides benets dened on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The Retirement saver plan RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a dened proportion of an employees annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with ination.
The latest full actuarial valuations have been carried out as at 5 April 2013 for the CARE Scheme and the RSP.
The results of these valuations have been used and updated for FRS 17 Retirement benets purposes for the period to 1 February 2015 by a qualied independent actuary.
The Group has previously entered into a pension funding partnership structure under which it has contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP valued at 90m as at 31 January 2013 to the Groups two CARE Schemes, of which 30m as at 31 January 2013 related to theMorrison CARE Scheme.
The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP reduce the respective deficits on a funding basis and an accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Schemes qualify as assets for FRS 17 purposes.
As partners in the SLP, the CARE Schemes are entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP twice a year for 20 years.
The SLP made a cash contribution of 6.6m 2.2m during the year ending 1 February 2015 and will make annual contributions of 6.6m 2.2m in respect of the MorrisonCARE Scheme for a further 18 years.
11.10.2 Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes dened benefit obligation are shown below.
Financial 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP Rate of increase in salaries 3.10% 2.30% 3.50% 2.70% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.10% to 3.10% 1.80% to 2.30% 2.30% to 3.50% 2.10% to 2.50% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 3.10% 3.10% 4.50% 4.40% Ination assumption RPI CPI 3.10% 2.30% 3.10% 2.30% 3.50% 2.70% 3.50% 2.70% Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP Male 24.2 n a 24.7 n a Female 25.8 n a 25.6 n a The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP Male 22.0 n a 22.3 n a Female 23.4 n a 23.2 n a Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for ageneration to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year-old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year-old today.
The projection used as at 1 February 2015 is the CMI 2012 projection table and incorporates a long term rate of improvement in longevity of 1.5% pa.
This compares to a projection of 80% 60% males females of the long cohort projection as at 2 February 2014.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities an appropriate mortality table that reects the longevity assumption is used.
The current mortality table used is 110% S1PFA 110% S1PFA-Heavy YOB 2014: S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 Financial statements 122 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 11 Company financial statements continued 11.10 Pensions continued The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2014 2014 CARE RSP Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.40% 7.40% Bonds 4.50% n a Gilts 3.40% n a Liability driven investments 3.40% n a Scottish Limited Partnership 4.65% n a Cash 1.10% n a The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
Due to changes in UK accounting standards which apply to the Company from 1 February 2015 the expected return on scheme assets assumptions isno longer required.
11.10.3 Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash ow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Equities 364 87 339 39 Bonds 288 228 Gilts 2 Liability driven investments 421 218 Scottish Limited Partnership 32 29 Cash 1 1 Total market value of assets 1,106 87 817 39 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,095 83 805 37 Net pension asset 11 4 12 2 Related deferred tax liability 2 1 3 Net pension asset after deferred tax 9 3 92 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 817 39 745 Expected return on scheme assets 44 4 41 Actuarial gain 239 7 19 Employer contributions 21 39 18 Employee contributions 12 5 Benets paid 16 4 11 Recognition of RSP scheme assets at end of period 39 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 1,106 87 817 39 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 123 11 Company financial statements continued 11.10 Pensions continued The movement in the present value of the dened benefit obligation during the period was as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Dened benefit obligation at the beginning of the period 805 37 717 Current service cost 24 37 16 Employee contributions 1 2 5 Other finance income 36 2 35 Actuarial loss 245 9 43 Benets paid 16 4 11 Recognition of RSP scheme assets at end of period 37 Dened benefit obligation at the end of the period 1,095 83 805 37 11.10.4 Sensitivities Listed below is the impact on the liabilities of changing key assumptions whilst holding other assumptions constant: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Discount factor 0.1% 28 2 20 Longevity 1 year 44 n a 25 n a 11.10.5 profit and loss account impact The following amounts have been charged in arriving at operating profit in respect of pension costs: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Current service cost 24 37 16 The amounts for current service cost and pensions credit have been charged in the following profit and loss account lines: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Cost of sales 19 30 13 Administrative expenses 5 7 3 24 37 16 The following amounts have been included in other finance income: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 44 4 41 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 36 2 35 82 6 Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 Financial statements 124 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 11 Company financial statements continued 11.10 Pensions continued 11.10.6 Amounts recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses The amounts included in the Statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL were: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 239 7 19 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 7 7 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 245 16 36 Recognition of the RSP in the balance sheet at the end of the period 2 Actuarial loss recognised in the STRGL 6 2 24 2 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Cumulative gross actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 152 2 190 2 Taxation on cumulative actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 38 Cumulative net actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 152 2 152 2 The actual return on scheme assets can therefore be summarised as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Expected return on scheme assets 44 4 41 n a Actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL reecting the difference between expected and actual returnon assets 239 7 19 n a Actual return on scheme assets 283 11 60 n a The expected return on scheme assets was determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
