Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Notes to the Parent Company financial statements at 31 December 2015 1.
Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
They have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The Company financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors for issue on 24 February 2016.
In these financial statements, the Company has adopted FRS 101 for the first time.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Financial Reporting Standard 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
The amendments to FRS 101 2013 14 Cycle issued in July 2015 have been adopted early.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Jersey Law 1991 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In the transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied IFRS 1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101.
There were no GAAP differences as a result of the transition to FRS 101 and so no restatements were required.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a Cash Flow Statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets, intangible assets and investment properties: related party disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: disclosures in respect of capital management: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: an additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy, the correction of error, or the reclassification of items in the financial statements: and disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of UBM plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in respect of group settled share-based payments: certain disclosures required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets in respect of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets: disclosures required by IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in respect of the cash flows of discontinued operations: certain disclosures required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations in respect of business combinations undertaken by the Company in the current and prior periods including the comparative period reconciliation for goodwill: and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement regarding financial instrument disclosures have not been provided apart from those which are relevant for the financial instruments which are held at fair value and are not either held as part of trading portfolio or derivatives.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS 101 balance sheet at 1 January 2015 for the purposes of the transition to FRS 101.
Significant accounting policies Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions arising from operating activities are translated from local currency into pounds sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the period end exchange rate.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency gains or losses are credited or charged to the profit and loss account as they arise.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company reviews investments for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The Company assesses whether such indicators exist at each reporting date.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount of the investment is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments Financial instruments in the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
Financial liabilities in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost borrowings, amounts owed to subsidiaries and other creditors.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, and in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, after taking account of directly attributable transaction costs.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2015 153 Financial Statements Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued at 31 December 2015 2.
Significant accounting policies continued All bank and other loans are initially recognised at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the loans.
After initial recognition, bank and other loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost and any difference between the proceeds and redemption value is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for taxable gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period on which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all items except freehold land.
Depreciation rates are calculated so that assets are written down to the residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease General plant, machinery and equipment 5-20 years Computer equipment 3-5 years An item of tangible fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the item is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Share-based payments Where a Parent Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payment, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, the Company has recognised an addition to investments in subsidiaries of the aggregate amount of these contributions that accrued in the year of 4.0m 2014: 1.9m with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders funds.
Full details of share-based payments transactions are provided in Note 7.3 of the Group financial statements.
Operating leases Payments excluding costs for services and insurance and receipts made under operating leases are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the profit and loss account as an integral part of the total lease expense or income.
