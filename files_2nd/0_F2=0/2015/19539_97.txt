Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Net debt and capital structure 12 Cash flow and net debt This note analyses our operational cash generation, shows the movement in our net debt in the year, and explains what is included within our cash balances and borrowings at the year-end.
Cash generated from operations is the starting point of our cash flow statement on page 109.
This section outlines the adjustments for any non-cash accounting items to reconcile our accounting profit for the year to the amount of physical cash we generated from our operations.
Net debt represents the amount of cash held less borrowings, overdrafts, finance lease payments due and cash held on behalf of customers.
Borrowings are mostly made up of fixed-term external debt which the Group has taken out in order to finance acquisitions in the past.

This arises as a consequence of providing payment transaction processing and electronic fund transfer services.
The balance represents cash in transit from third parties to Sage Customers.
Accordingly, a liability for the same amount is included in trade and other payables on the balance sheet and is classified within net debt.
12.3 Cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts Accounting policy For the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated statement of cash flows and the Consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity period of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are an integral part of a subsidiarys cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents where they have a legal right of set-off and there is an intention to settle net, against positive cash balances, otherwise bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings.

The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as the Board-approved Group treasury policy limits the value that can be invested with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The Group policy is to place cash and cash equivalents with counterparties which are well established banks with high credit ratings where available.
In some jurisdictions there is limited availability of such counterparties.
At 30 September 2015, 83% of the cash and cash equivalents balance was deposited with financial institutions rated at least A3 by Moodys Investors Service.
The investment instruments utilised are money market funds, money market term deposits and bank deposits.
140 The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 12.4 Borrowings Accounting policy Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of borrowing on an effective interest basis.
