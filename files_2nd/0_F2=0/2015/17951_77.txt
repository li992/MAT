Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 24 Financial instruments and risk management continued IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the Income Statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
For the purposes of this sensitivity analysis, financial assets and liabilities with fixed interest rates are not included.
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change except where rates are less than 100 basis points.
In these instances it is assumed that the interest rates increase by 100 basis points and decrease to zero for the purpose of performing the sensitivity analysis.
The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year-end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being 65 million lower 2014: 35 million lower.
A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, or less where applicable, would result in pre-tax profit being 40 million higher 2014: 20 million higher.
The effect of these interest rate changes on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is not material in either year.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The process for monitoring and managing credit risk once sales to customers have been made varies depending on local practice in the countries concerned.
Certain territories have bank guarantees, other guarantees and credit insurance provided in the Groups favour in respect of Group trade receivables, the issuance and terms of which are dependent on local practices in the countries concerned.
All derivatives are subject to ISDA agreements or equivalent documentation.
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from the related counterparties.
Generally the Group aims to transact with counterparties with strong investment grade credit ratings.
However, the Group recognises that due to the need to operate over a large geographic footprint, this will not always be possible.
Counterparty credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
The credit ratings of all counterparties are reviewed regularly.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient counterparty credit capacity of requisite quality to undertake all anticipated transactions throughout its geographic footprint, while at the same time ensuring that there is no geographic concentration in the location of counterparties.
With the following exceptions, the maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets at the balance sheet date is reflected by the carrying values included in the Group Balance Sheet.
The Group has issued guarantees to third parties, part of which has been recognised on the Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The unrecognised portion of these guaranteed amounts was nil 2014: 28 million.
During 2014, the Group entered into a guarantee arrangement in respect of the borrowings of the noncontrolling interest in relation to the capital injection made to the Groups Algerian business see note 26 c. The maximum exposure under the arrangement would be 3 million 2014: 4 million.
In addition, the Group has entered into short-term risk participation agreements in relation to certain leaf supply arrangements and the maximum exposure under these would be 105 million 2014: 106 million.
The impact of own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and other obligations held at fair value is not material.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on equity investments held by the Group, which are included in available-for-sale investments on the Group Balance Sheet, but the quantum of such is not material.
Hedge accounting In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is repeated periodically to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain highly effective.
Fair value estimation The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than one year, other than derivatives, are assumed to approximate their book values.
For other financial instruments which are measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, the basis for fair values is described below.

Level 2 financial instruments are not traded in an active market, but the fair values are based on quoted market prices, broker dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
The Groups level 2 financial instruments include OTC derivatives.
The fair values of level 3 financial instruments have been determined using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
The Groups level 3 financial instruments primarily consist of an equity investment in an unquoted entity which is valued using the discounted cash flows of estimated future dividends.
The valuation assumes the following: future dividends grow by 3.5% 2014: 2.0% and a 100 basis points decrease in the growth rate would result in the valuation being 1 million lower 2014: 6 million lower : and discount rate of 8.3% 2014: 6.5% and a 100 basis points decrease in the discount rate would result in the valuation being 14 million higher 2014: 10 million higher.
