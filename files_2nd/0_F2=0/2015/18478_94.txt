Notes to the Group financial statements 156 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 continued 32.
Post-employment benefit arrangements and related risks continued d Risks in connection with pension arrangements Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical benefits arrangements, the Group is exposed to a number of risks that are inherent in such plans and arrangements.
There are, however, no unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and no significant concentrations of risk.
The risks can be summarised as follows: asset value volatility, with the associated impact on the assets held in connection with the funding of pension obligations and the related cash flows: changes in bond yields, with any reduction resulting in an increase in the present value of pension obligations, mitigated by an increase in the value of plan assets: inflation, as pension obligations are generally linked to inflation and the prevailing rate of inflation experienced for medical benefits is typically higher than other inflation measures in the UK: and life expectancy, as pension and medical benefits are generally provided for the life of beneficiaries and their dependants.
Post-employment benefit assets and obligations An overview of the Groups post-employment benefit arrangements is given in note 32.
The disclosures required by IAS 19 revised, which relate to the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements and post-employment medical benefits obligations only, are set out below.

Post-employment benefit assets and obligations continued c Actuarial assumptions and sensitivities The accounting valuations at 31 March 2015 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 revised.
The assumptions for the real discount rate, salary increases and mortality, used to calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligations, all have a significant effect on the accounting valuation.
Changes to these assumptions in the light of prevailing conditions may have a significant impact on future valuations.
Indications of the sensitivity of the amounts reported at 31 March 2015 to changes in the real discount rate, life expectancy and medical costs are included below.
The methods and types of assumptions used are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 March 2014 and the absolute sensitivity numbers are stated on a basis consistent with the methodology used in determining the accounting valuation as at 31 March 2015.
The methodology evaluates the effect of a change in each assumption on the relevant obligations, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
i Principal financial actuarial assumptions 2015 2014 % % Discount rate 3.3 4.3 Inflation rate based on the UK Retail Prices Index the RPI 2.9 3.3 Inflation rate based on the UK Consumer Prices Index the CPI 1.9 2.3 Increase in salaries 3.4 3.8 Increase for pensions in payment element based on the RPI where cap is 5% 2.8 3.0 Increase for pensions in payment element based on the CPI where cap is 2.5% 1.5 1.7 Increase for pensions in payment element based on the CPI where cap is 3% 1.7 1.9 Increase for pensions in deferment 1.9 2.3 Inflation in medical costs 5.9 6.8 The principal financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation.
The discount rate is based on the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term to the defined benefit obligations.
In the case of the Experian Pension Scheme, the obligations are primarily in sterling and have a maturity of some 18 years.
If the real discount rate increased decreased by 0.1%, the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2015 would decrease increase by approximately US$19m and the annual current service cost would remain unchanged.
The rates of increase for pensions in payment reflect the separate arrangements applying to different groups of Experians pensioners.
ii Mortality assumptions average life expectancy on retirement at age 65 in normal health 2015 2014 years years For a male currently aged 65 23.3 23.2 For a female currently aged 65 25.1 25.0 For a male currently aged 50 24.6 24.6 For a female currently aged 50 26.5 26.9 The valuation assumes that mortality will be in line with standard tables adjusted to reflect the expected experience of the Experian Pension Scheme membership, based on analysis carried out for the 2013 actuarial valuation.
A specific allowance for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy is also incorporated.
An increase in assumed life expectancy of 0.1 years would increase the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2015 by approximately US$4m.
iii Post-retirement healthcare The valuation in respect of post-retirement healthcare benefits assumes a rate of increase for medical costs.
If this rate increased decreased by 1.0% per annum, the obligation at 31 March 2015 would increase decrease by US$1m and the finance expense would remain unchanged.
