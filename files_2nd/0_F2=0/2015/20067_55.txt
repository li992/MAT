Notes to the consolidated financial statements 87 18. retirement benefit plans Background The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit plans.
The groups main plans are in the UK and the largest by membership is the BT Pension Scheme BTPS which is a defined benefit plan that was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
After that date new entrants in the UK have been able to join a defined contribution plan, currently the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract based arrangement.
Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension arrangement under which the benefits are linked to contributions paid, the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the form in which individuals choose to take their benefits.
Contributions are paid into an independently administered fund.
The income statement charge in respect of defined contribution plans represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a fixed percentage of employees pay.
The company has no exposure to investment and other experience risks.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the plan rules dependent on factors such as age, years of service and pensionable pay and is not dependent upon actual contributions made by the company or members.
The income statement service cost in respect of defined benefit plans represents the increase in the defined benefit liability arising from pension benefits earned by active members in the current period.
The company is exposed to investment and other experience risks and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions, expected investment income and assets held.

b The actuarial gain or loss arises from changes in the assumptions used to value the defined benefit liabilities at the end of the year compared with the assumptions used at the start of the year.
Thisincludes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and demographic assumptions such as life expectancy.
c The actuarial loss or gain arising from experience adjustments on defined benefit liabilities represents the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared with the assumptions made at the start of the year.
Such differences might arise, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement, actual salary increases being different from those assumed or actual benefit increases being higher than the inflation assumption.
indb 88 5 19 2015 1:07:24 AM Notes to the consolidated financial statements 89 18. retirement benefit plans continued BTpS At 31 March 2015 there were 306,500 members of the BTPS.
Members belong to one of three sections depending upon the date they first joined the scheme.
Section A is for members who joined before 1 December 1971, Section B is for members who joined the scheme between 1December 1971 and 31 March 1986 and Section C is for members who joined the scheme on or after 1 April 1986 but before the scheme closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
The membership is analysed below.
Number of Number of Number of Total At 31 March 2015 active members deferred members pensioners membership a Sections A and B 15,000 32,000 176,000 223,000 Section C 23,000 40,500 20,000 83,500 Total 38,000 72,500 196,000 306,500 At 31 March 2014 a Sections A and B 17,000 35,500 176,500 229,000 Section C 24,000 41,000 19,000 84,000 Total 41,000 76,500 195,500 313,000 a Section A and Section B memberships have been aggregated in this table as Section A members have typically elected to take Section B benefits at retirement.
Since 1 April 2009, when changes to member benefits and contribution rates were introduced, Section B and C members have accrued benefits based upon a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis and a normal pensionable age of 65.
On a CARE basis benefits are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of inflation or the individuals actual pay increase in each year to retirement.
Benefits earned for pensionable service prior to 1 April 2009 are based upon a members final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.
Under the scheme rules the determination of the rate of inflation for statutory minimum rates of revaluation and indexation of benefits is based upon either the Retail Prices Index RPI or the Consumer Prices Index CPI which apply to each category of member as shown below.

Management of the scheme BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by BT as an independent trustee to administer and manage the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed there are nine Trustee directors all of whom are appointed by BT.
The chairman of the Trustee is appointed after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the relevant trade unions who are also responsible for nominating four directors to act as representatives of the members.
Ofthe remaining four directors, two will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualified candidate, at least one of the Trustee directors is customarily a current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS.
Trustee directors are usually appointed for a three-year term but are then eligible for re-appointment.
BTpS assets Asset allocation The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
Theallocations set reflect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match liabilities.
Current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.
The BTPS also uses financial instruments to balance the asset allocation and to manage inflation risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Under IAS19 plan assets must be valued at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
For the main asset categories securities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices properties are valued on the basis of open market value unlisted equities are valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC guidelines unlisted fixed interest and index-linked instruments are valued using the latest market price or using discounted cash flow models that consider credit risk.

b Assets with a quoted price in an active market.
d Alternative asset classes include commodities, private equity and credit opportunities.
Longevity insurance On 4 July 2014, the Scheme entered into arrangements to hedge around 25% of the Schemes exposure to potential improvements in longevity.
These arrangements form part of the Schemes investment portfolio and will provide income to the Scheme in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected under the terms of the contract.
To facilitate the transaction, the Trustee set up a wholly owned insurance company.
The Scheme transferred longevity risk to this insurer, who has in turn reinsured this longevity risk with The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a U. S. based life insurance company.
These arrangements required no additional cash contributions from BT.
At 31 March 2015, the fair value of the insurance contract was negligible and has been included within cash and other assets.
Investment performance The Trustee reports on investment performance against a benchmark which is based on the asset mix and the market returns for each asset class.
BTPS performance against the benchmark for the periods to 30 June 2014 was as follows.
Over under Benchmark Actual BTPS performance Period ending 30 June 2014 % return % % 1 year 6.2 6.2 3 years 6.2 5.8 0.4 10 years 6.5 7.0 0.5 BTpS liabilities under IAS 19 Valuation methodology The liabilities of the BTPS are measured as the present value of the estimated future benefit cash flows to be paid by the Scheme, calculated using the projected unit credit method.
These calculations are performed for the company by a professionally qualified independent actuary.
The expected future benefit payments are based on a number of assumptions including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement.
The estimated duration of BTPS liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is around 15 years although the benefits payable by the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 80 years as shown in the graph below.
Whilst benefit payments are expected to increase over the earlier years, the value of the liabilities is expected to reduce.

Key assumptions IAS 19 The key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS under IAS 19 are shown below.
a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 At 31 March % % % % % % Rate used to discount liabilities 3.25 4.25 4.20 0.39 0.97 0.87 Inflation increase in RPI 2.85 3.25 3.30 b c c b c c Inflation increase in CPI 1.85 2.50 2.55 1.0 0.75 0.75 a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation and is shown as a comparator.
b Assumed to be 0.2% lower after 31 March 2017. c Assumed to be 0.45% lower after 31 March 2016.
Rate used to discount liabilities IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
The discount rate at 31March 2015 is based on a market-based AA corporate bond yield curve allowing for the future expected benefit payments from the BTPS.
Inflation increases in RPI and CPI Salary increases are assumed to be aligned with CPI inflation whilst benefits are assumed to increase by either RPI or CPI inflation as prescribed by the rules of the BTPS and summarised above.
The assumption for RPI has been assessed by reference to yields on long-term fixed and index-linked Government bonds and Bank of England published inflationary expectations.
CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI taking into account market forecasts and independent estimates of the long-term difference.
Longevity The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows.
2015 2014 Number of Number of At 31 March years years Male in lower pay bracket 26.0 26.0 Male in medium pay bracket 27.3 27.7 Male in higher pay bracket 28.7 Female in lower pay bracket 28.7 28.5 Female in higher pay bracket 29.0 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.0 1.0 The assumptions about life expectancy have regard to information published by the UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation.
However, due to the size of the membership of the BTPS it is considered appropriate for the adopted life expectancy assumptions to take into account the actual membership experience of the scheme.
Allowance is also made for future improvements in mortality.
The BTPS actuary undertakes formal reviews of the membership experience at every triennial valuation.

The table below provides an indication of the sensitivity of the IAS19 pension liabilities at 31 March 2015, and of the income statement charge for 2015 16, to changes in these assumptions.
There may also be a move in the assets from changes in conditions.
The total expected impact to liabilities and assets is illustrated as the sensitivity of the deficit.
For example, the life expectancy scenario incorporates the expected movement in the value of the longevity hedge.

BTpS funding Triennial funding valuation The triennial valuation is carried out for the Trustee by a professionally qualified independent actuary.
Thepurpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the Scheme has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
The latest funding valuation was performed as at 30 June 2014.
The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 30 June 2017.
The valuation methodology for funding purposes, which is based on prudent assumptions, is broadly as follows: assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and liabilities are measured on an actuarial funding basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The results of the two most recent triennial valuations are shown below.
June June 2014 2011 valuation valuation bn bn BTPS liabilities 47.2 40.8 Market value of BTPS assets 40.2 36.9 Funding deficit 7.0 3.9 Percentage of accrued benefits covered by BTPS assets at valuation date 85.2% 90.4% Percentage of accrued benefits on a solvency basis covered by the BTPS assets at the valuation date 63.0% 66.0% The funding deficit increased to 7.0bn at 30 June 2014.
While deficit contribution payments totalling 2.65bn and investment returns of 5.8% per year since the 2011 valuation contributed to higher assets at the 2014 valuation date, the low interest rate environment resulted in a higher value being placed on the Schemes liabilities which more than offset the improvements in the Schemes assets.
Key assumptions funding valuation These valuations were determined using the following prudent long-term assumptions.
a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year June 2014 June 2011 June 2014 June 2011 valuation valuation valuation valuation % % % % Average single equivalent discount rate 4.5 5.2 1.0 2.0 Average long-term increase in RPI 3.5 3.2 Average long-term increase in CPI 2.5 2.2 1.0 1.0 a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation and is shown as a comparator.
In line with developing market practice and reflecting a more sophisticated methodology, the discount rate at 30 June 2014 has been derived from prudent return expectations above a yield curve based on gilt and swap rates.
The discount rate reflects views of future returns at the valuation date.
This gives a prudent discount rate of 2.1% per year above the yield curve initially, trending down to 0.6% per year above the curve in the long-term.
The assumption is equivalent to using a flat discount rate of 4.5% per year.
indb 92 5 19 2015 1:07:24 AM Notes to the consolidated financial statements 93 18. retirement benefit plans continued The average life expectancy assumptions at the 2014 valuation date, for members 60 years of age, are as follows.

Future funding obligations and recovery plan Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the group is required to have a funding plan, determined at the conclusion of the triennial funding valuation, which is a legal agreement between BT and the Trustee and should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
In January 2015, the 2014 triennial funding valuation was finalised, agreed with the Trustee and certified by the Scheme Actuary.
The funding deficit at 30 June 2014 was 7.0bn.
Under the associated recovery plan BT made payments of 875m in March 2015 and 625m in April 2015.
BT will make future deficit payments in line with the table below.
Year to 31 March 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Deficit contribution m 250 250 688 699 711 724 670 670 670 495 495 495 495 495 289 The ordinary contribution rate to meet the benefits of current employed members increased from 13.5% to 16.0% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 1 April 2015 through to the next valuation date.
Other protections The 2014 funding agreement with the Trustee included additional features for BT to provide support to the Scheme.
These include: Feature Detail Shareholder In the event that shareholder distributions exceed an agreed threshold, BT will provide matching payments to the Scheme.
distributions The threshold allows for 15% per year dividend per share growth plus 300m per year of share buybacks on a cumulative basis.
BT will consult with the Trustee if it considers share buybacks in excess of 300m per year or making a special dividend.
These provisions apply from 29 January 2015 until 31 March 2019, or until the finalisation of the next valuation if earlier.
Material corporate In the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals net of acquisitions in any 12-month events period, BT will make additional contributions to the Scheme equal to one third of those net cash proceeds.
BT will consult with the Trustee if: it considers making acquisitions with a total cost of more than 1bn in any 12-month period: or it considers making disposals of more than 1bn: or it considers making a Class 1 transaction acquisition or disposal : or it is subject to a takeover offer.
BT will advise the Trustee should there be other material corporate events which may impact BTs covenant to the Scheme.
Negative pledge A negative pledge that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the Scheme in excess of a 1.5bn threshold, to cover both British Telecommunications plc and BT Group plc.
This provision applies until the deficit reduces to below 2.0bn at any subsequent funding valuation.
