Other intangible assets arising on acquisition represent customer relationships, customer contracts at the date of acquisition, patents and trade names.
In 2015, for impairment testing purposes goodwill has been allocated to 18 separate cash-generating units CGUs.
Of these, the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to four individual CGUs Suncoast, Keller Canada, HJ Foundations and Keller Limited is significant in comparison to the total carrying amount of goodwill and comprises 65% of the total.
The carrying amounts allocated to four further CGUs, taken together, comprise a further 23% of the total.
The relevant CGUs and the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to each are as set out below, together with the pre-tax discount rate and medium-term growth rate used in their value-in-use calculations: 2015 2015 2015 2014 2014 2014 Carrying Pre-tax Forecast Carrying Pre-tax Forecast value discount rate growth rate value discount rate growth rate Cash-generating unit Geographical segment m % % m % % Suncoast North America 29.1 12.7 2.0 27.7 13.4 3.0 Keller Canada North America 27.6 11.9 2.0 64.9 11.3 2.0 HJ Foundations North America 18.7 14.9 2.0 17.9 16.0 3.0 Keller Limited EMEA 12.1 11.9 2.0 12.1 12.4 2.0 Hayward Baker North America 9.7 13.4 2.0 9.0 16.7 3.0 Resource Piling Asia 7.7 12.2 2.0 7.9 11.9 2.0 Waterway Australia 6.9 14.6 1.0 7.4 15.7 1.0 Austral Australia 6.7 14.6 2.0 n a n a n a Other Various 15.5 13.6 134.0 160.5 The recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to each CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The calculations all use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a three-year period.
The Groups businesses operate in cyclical markets, some of which are expected to continue to face uncertain conditions over the next couple of years.
The most important factors in the value-in-use calculations, however, are the forecast revenues and operating margins during the forecast period and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.
The key assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are therefore the revenue and operating margins assumed throughout the forecast period.
The discount rates used in the value-in-use calculations are based on the weighted average cost of capital of companies comparable to the relevant CGUs, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the asset being tested.
Management considers all the forecast revenues, margins and profits to be reasonably achievable given recent performance and the historic trading results of the relevant CGUs.
Cash flows beyond 2018 have been extrapolated using a steady growth rate of between 1% and 2% shown in the table above, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the relevant CGUs operate.
KELLER GROUP PLC 86 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13 Intangible assets continued Management believes that, with the exception of Keller Canada, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts of the CGUs identified above are based would not cause any of their carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Based on the value-in-use calculation in 2015, the recoverable amount is C$165.1m 80.5m and therefore the Keller Canada goodwill has been impaired by C$60.9m 31.2m, with C$56.6m 27.6m of goodwill remaining on the balance sheet at 31 December 2015.
Therefore, in the event that the assumptions in the value-in-use calculation were to prove to be over optimistic, this would lead to a further impairment of goodwill.
The assumptions underlying the forecasts used in the value-in-use calculation are for a gradual recovery in the Canadian market in the medium term, albeit to a level lower than that expected at the time of acquisition, such that the compound annual revenue growth rate is 4% over the period under review and operating margins gradually recover to 8.5%.
A 1% reduction in assumed operating margins in each year would result in a further impairment of C$20.5m 10.0m.
Alternatively, a 1% increase in the discount rate would lead to a further impairment of C$15.5m 7.6m or a 5% reduction in forecast revenue in each year, at the assumed operating margins, would result in a further impairment of C$6.2m 3.0m.

Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Derivatives The fair value of interest rate and cross-currency swaps is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In 2015 and in 2014, the valuation methods of all of the Groups derivative financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised as Level 2.
Level 2 is defined as inputs, other than quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
KELLER GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Contingent consideration Fair value is calculated based on the amounts expected to be paid, determined by reference to forecasts of future performance of the acquired businesses discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the probability of contingent events and targets being achieved.
In 2015 and in 2014, the valuation methods of all of the Groups contingent consideration carried at fair value are categorised as Level 3.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Groups contingent consideration are forecast revenue growth rates 2015: -10%14%, forecast EBITDA margins 2015: 9%23% and pre-tax discount rates 2015: 15%22%.

The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration could be affected if the forecast revenue growth rates or forecast EBITDA margins are different to those stated above.
A higher forecast revenue growth rate or higher EBITDA margin may increase the value of the contingent consideration payable.
Trade and other payables and receivables and construction work in progress For payables and receivables with a remaining life of one year or less, the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other payables and receivables are discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

The Scheme can invest in a wide range of asset classes including equities, bonds, cash, property, alternatives including private equity, commodities, hedge funds, infrastructure, currency, high yield debt and derivatives and annuity policies.
