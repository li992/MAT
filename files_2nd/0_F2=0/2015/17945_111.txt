Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows the timing of cash outflows for derivative financial instruments entered into for the purpose of managing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with net debt, whether or not hedge accounting is applied, based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of crosscurrency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts inflows for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $15,706 million at 31 December 2015 2014 $14,615 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.

Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 28.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the application of hedge accounting and the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date.
These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Over-the-counter OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers.
These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available.
In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in managements best estimate of fair value.
These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative financial instruments continued Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors.
The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 28.
The following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
Derivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.
The sale agreement contained an embedded derivative the whole agreement has, consequently, been designated at fair value through profit or loss and shown within other derivatives held for trading, and falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The valuation depends on refinery throughput and future margins.

Derivative gains and losses Gains and losses relating to derivative contracts are included within sales and other operating revenues and within purchases in the income statement depending upon the nature of the activity and type of contract involved.
The contract types treated in this way include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, and relate to both currency and commodity trading activities.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
Also included within sales and other operating revenues are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all these items excluding gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases was a net gain of $5,508 million 2014 $6,154 million net gain and 2013 $587 million net gain.
This number does not include gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases or the change in value of transportation and storage contracts which are not recognized under IFRS, but does include the associated financially settled contracts.
The net amount for actual gains and losses relating to derivative contracts and all related items therefore differs significantly from the amount disclosed above.
Embedded derivatives The group has embedded derivatives relating to certain natural gas contracts.
The fair value gain on commodity price embedded derivatives included within distribution and administration expenses was $120 million 2014 gain of $430 million, 2013 gain of $459 million.
Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2015, the group held currency forwards, futures contracts and cylinders and cross-currency interest rate swaps that were being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast transactions and floating rate finance debt.
Note 28 outlines the groups approach to foreign currency exchange risk management.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to the income statement.
The amounts remaining in equity at 31 December 2015 in relation to these cash flow hedges consist of deferred losses of $55 million maturing in 2016, deferred losses of $15 million maturing in 2017 and deferred losses of $3 million maturing in 2018 and beyond.
Two of the contracts to acquire an 18.5% interest in Rosneft, which completed in March 2013, were designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge.
A cumulative charge of $651 million has been recognized in other comprehensive income, of which a charge of $2,061 million arose in 2013.
This loss will only be reclassified to the income statement if the investment in Rosneft is either sold or impaired.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2015, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The loss on the hedging derivative instruments recognized in the income statement in 2015 was $788 million 2014 $14 million loss and 2013 $1,240 million loss offset by a gain on the fair value of the finance debt of $833 million 2014 $8 million gain and 2013 $1,228 million gain.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps mature within one to eleven years, and have the same maturity terms as the debt that they are hedging.
They are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Norwegian Krone and Hong Kong dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt.
Note 28 outlines the groups approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management.
