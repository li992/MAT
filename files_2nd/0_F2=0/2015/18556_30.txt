Metal assays were capped where appropriate.
Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent or NSR cutoff grades and assuming reasonable metal recoveries.
Orisyvo, Lucerito, Candamea and Guachichil mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries for oxide and sulfide material.
Equivalent metal grades and conceptual pit optimisation are based on US$1,150 US$1,300 per ounce of gold for underground or open pit projects, respectively, US$15 per ounce of silver, US$0.78 per pound of zinc and US$0.75 per pound of lead.
2 Cutoff grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.
3 Portions of the Valdecaas deposit within the Minera Juanicipio property where Fresnillo plc holds a 56% interest.
Mineral resources quoted reflect Fresnillo plcs attributable 56% ownership.
4 Mineral resources statement prepared independently by SRK CA.
Mineral reserves are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution, mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative G&A costs, and variable NSR factors NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs.

3 Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade.
4 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access.
SRK has been provided with documents indicating a reasonable chance that these actions will be settled in favour of the mine.
5 Reserves have no additional dilution added to that inherent in the Selective Mining Unit SMU of 15m x 15m x 8m.
Reserves are converted from resources through the process of pit optimisation, pit design, production schedule and supported by a Minera Penmont cash flow model.
6 Reserves include planned dilution to a minimum mining width and to minable outlines.
Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of cut-off grades and metal equivalent grades are: Gold US$ oz 1,150.00, Silver US$ oz 15.00, Lead US$ lb 0.75 and Zinc US$ lb 0.78.
Full mining recovery assumed with a factor applied for pillars.
The reserves are valid as of 31 December 2015.
All topography is valid as of 31 October 2015.
The ore reserves were estimated by Fresnillo.
