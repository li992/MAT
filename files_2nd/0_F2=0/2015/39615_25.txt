These events of default include non-payment, insolvency and breach of covenant relating to interest excluding arrangement fees, adjusted net debt and EBITDA.
It is not anticipated that the GrouS LV DW ULVN RI breaching any of these obligations.
The covenants require the Group to maintain the leverage ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA below 3:1 and EBITDA to interest excluding arrangement fees above 3.5:1.
Adjusted net debt consists of net debt plus Letters of Credit contingent liabilities in respect of the UKPIL 5 insurance programme, where the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote and is adjusted for exchange rate movements during the year.
The Groups ratio of EBITDA to interest excluding arrangement fees at 29 March 2015 is 40.4:1 2013-14 31.4:1.
As a result, the Group is well within its covenant agreement at 29 March 2015.
The interest rate chargeable on the s QGLFDWHG EDQN loan facility would increase if more than one third of the facility was drawn and would increase if the Group's leverage ratio exceeded 1:1.
Under the loan agreement, the maximum interest rate chargeable would be LIBOR plus 1.45 per cent.
The 500 million bond becomes repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the bond agreement.
These events of default include non-payment and insolvency.
The blended interest rate on gross debt for the period to 27 March 2016 is forecast to be approximately three per cent.

Reported Reported 52 weeks ZHHNV 2015 2014 m m Profit before tax 400 1,664 At UK standard rate of corporation tax of 21% 2013-14 23% 84 383 Effect of higher taxes on overseas earnings 6 2 Tax over provided in prior years 7 5 Non-deductible expenses 19 10 Associates profit after tax charge included in Group pre-tax profit 1 1 Tax effect of property disposals 29 - Net increase in tax charge resulting from non-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 2 9 Effect of change in tax rates 2 12 Tax charge in the income statement 72 386 Current tax Substantially all of the current tax charge for the Group is in respect of GLS.
UK taxable profits in 2014-15 are almost fully covered by a combination of brought forward losses, capital allowance claims and a further statutory deduction in respect of shares awarded to employees under the Employee Free Shares scheme.
Accordingly, the current tax rate for the Group is 10 per cent.
Effective tax rate The effective tax rate on reported profit is 18 per cent, comprising current tax due on reported profits and deferred tax in relation to temporary differences.
This rate is below the UK statutory rate, principally because no tax charge has been recognised in relation to property disposals, as no tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the grounds that were the assets into which gains have been rolled to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise.
GLS pays tax in a number of territories, with the majority of its profits in the period to 29 March 2015 earned in territories where the tax rate is above the UK statutory tax rate.
Certain subsidiaries, notably GLS France, remain unable to recognise tax credits on losses made during the reporting period.
These factors contribute to GLS having a higher effective tax rate for the period than the UK statutory rate.

This increase in the reported liability is primarily as a result of the deferred tax impact of the increase in UK pension assets as described in note 8, which has been reflected in other comprehensive income.
GLS has deferred tax assets and liabilities in various jurisdictions which cannot be offset against one another.
The main balance relates to goodwill and intangibles liabilities in GLS Germany, for which the GURXS KDV DOUHDG WDNHQ WD[ GHGXFWLRQV At 29 March 2015, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of 68 million 2013-14 68 million comprising 61 million 2013-14 63 million relating to tax losses of 227 million 2013-14 238 million, mainly in GLS, that are available for offset against future profits if generated in the relevant companies and 7 million 2013-14 5 million in relation to 33 million 2013-14 23 million of UK capital losses carried forward.
The Group has not recognised these deferred tax assets on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain of its capacity to utilise them in the future.
The Group also has temporary differences in respect of 295 million 2013-14 307 million of capital losses, the tax effect of which is 59 million 2013-14 61 million in respect of assets previously qualifying for industrial buildings allowances.
Further temporary differences exist in relation to 308 million 2013-14 214 million of gains for which rollover relief has been claimed, the tax effect of which is 62 million 2013-14 43 million.
No tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the basis that, were the assets into which the gains have been rolled to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise.

Employee benefits pensions At 29 March 2015, a pension asset of 3,179 million has been recognised compared with 1,723 million at 30 March 2014.
This increase is primarily due to the return on liability hedging assets as explained further in this note.

The employer contribution cash flow rate forms part of the payroll expense and is paid into the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP RM section.
The contribution rate is set following each actuarial funding valuation, usually every three years.
These actuarial valuations are required to be carried out on assumptions determined by the Trustee and agreed by Royal Mail UK Defined Contribution Scheme The Group operates the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan, which was launched in April 2009 and is open to employees who joined the Company from 31 March 2008 following closure of the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP to new members.
Ongoing UK defined contribution scheme costs have increased from 25 million in 2013-14 to 38 million, mainly due to an increase in the average employers contribution rate from 3.8 per cent in 2013-14 to 5.4 per cent.

Employee benefits pensions continued UK Defined Benefit Schemes Royal Mail Group Limited had one of the largest defined benefit pension schemes in the UK based on membership and assets, called the RMPP.
On 1 April 2012 one ZHHN LQWR WKH -13 reporting year after the granting of State Aid approval by the European Commission to HM Government on 21 March 2012 almost all of the historic pension liabilities and pension assets of RMPP, built up until 31 March 2012, were transferred to a new HM Government pension scheme, the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme RMSPS.
On this date, RMPP was also sectionalised, with Royal Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited each responsible for their own sections from 1 April 2012 onwards.
The transfer left the Royal Mail section RM section of the RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis.

All further references in this note to the RMPP, relate to its RM section.
Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP The RMPP is funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds.
RMPP includes sections A, B and C, each with different terms and conditions: Section A is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined before 1 December 1971: Section B is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1 December 1971 and before 1 April 1987 or for members of Section A who chose to receive Section B benefits: and Section C is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1 April 1987 and before 1 April 2008.
Benefits provided are based on FDUHHU VDODU EORFNV IRU HDUV VHUYLFH UHYDOXHG DQQXDOO Following conclusion of the March 2012 actuarial valuation, the regular future service contribution rate for RMPP, expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay, remained at 17.1 per cent.
As the valuation showed the Plan to be in surplus, no deficit correction payments are currently being made by the Company.
The Group expects to contribute around 369 million to the RMPP in respect of normal cash service costs in 2015-16.
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP The Group also contributes to a smaller defined benefit scheme for executives, RMSEPP which closed in December 2012 to future accrual.

Deficit correction payments in 2014-15 were 10 million 2013-14 10 million.
A liability of 2 million 2013-14 1 million has been recognised for future payment of pension benefits to a past Director.
Pensions Reform In June 2013, the Company began a consultation with RMPP members on a proposal to ensure the RMPP could remain open to future accrual, subject to certain conditions, at least until the conclusion of the next periodic review in March 2018.
Subsequently, on 26 September 2013, the Company agreed with the RMPP Trustee to implement a Pensions Reform with effect from 1 April 2014.
The agreed changes due to the Pensions Reform were considered to be a Plan amendment which met the IAS 19 definition of a past service cost, and as such 1,350 million was recognised in the income statement of the Group for the comparative year ended 30 March 2014.

Employee benefits pensions continued The surplus in RMPP is assumed to be recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions.
Therefore, no IFRIC 14 adjustment is required.
The Directors do not believe that the current excess of pension scheme assets over the liabilities on an accounting basis will result in an excess of pension assets on a funding basis.
However, the Directors are required to account for the pension scheme based on their legal right to benefit from a surplus, using long-term actuarial assumptions current at the reporting date, as required by IFRS.
The actuarial cash funding surplus of 1,793 million at 31 March 2015 31 March 2014 surplus of 1,422 million allows the RMPP to remain open for the benefit of the members at least until March 2018, subject to certain conditions as part of the Pensions Reform agreement, without requiring either WKH &RPSDQ RU LQGLYLGXDOV WR PDNH XQDIIRUGDEOH LQFUHDVHV WR WKHLU FDVK FRQWULEXWLRQV The funding liabilities have increased more than the accounting liabilities since they are calculated by reference to gilt yields which have fallen to a greater extent than corporate bond yields on which the accounting liabilities are calculated.
As a result, the funding surplus has increased less than the accounting surplus.
The following disclosures relate to the major assumptions, sensitivities, surplus and gains losses in the RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit schemes.
a Major long-term assumptions used for accounting IAS 19 purposes - RMPP and RMSEPP The major assumptions used to calculate the accounting position of the pension schemes were as follows: Reported Reported at 29 March at 30 March 2015 2014 Retail Price Index RPI 3.1% 3.4% Consumer Price Index CPI 2.1% 2.4% Discount rate nominal 3.5% 4.5% 3 real nominal less RPI 0.4% 1.1% 4 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of increase for deferred pensions CPI CPI Rate of pension increases RMPP Sections A B CPI CPI 4 Rate of pension increases RMPP Section C RPI0.1% RPI-0.1% Rate of pension increases RMSEPP members transferred from Section A or B of RMPP CPI CPI 4 Rate of pension increases RMSEPP all other members RPI0.1% RPI-0.1% Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old male RMPP member 29 27 years 29 27 years Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old female RMPP member 32 30 years 32 30 years 3 The real discount rate used reflects the long average duration of the RMPP scheme of around 30 years 4 The rate of increase in salaries, and the rate of pension increase for Section C members who joined RMPP on or after April 1987 and RMSEPP all other members, is capped at five per cent, which results in the average long-term pension increase assumption being 10 basis points lower than the RPI long-term assumption Mortality The mortality assumptions for RMPP are based on the latest Self Administered Pension Scheme SAPS S1 mortality tables with appropriate scaling factors 106 per cent for male pensioners and 101 per cent for female pensioners.
Future improvements are based on the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term trend of 1.25 per cent per annum.

The liabilities projected to accrue to March 2017 have already been hedged predominantly through investment in gilts and derivatives interest rate and inflation rate swaps held in Unit Trust pooled investments providing economic exposure to gilts.
The impact of the Plans advance hedging of projected funding liabilities is to increase volatility in the pension surplus due to the return on the liability hedging assets not being matched by an increase in the accrued liabilities.
As the accrued liabilities get closer to the projected liabilities that have been hedged, this volatility will reduce.
The increase in the liability hedged assets is predominantly reflected in the Unit Trust values above which have increased from 1,864 million at 30 March 2014 to 4,166 million at 29 March 2015.
The notional value covered by the interest rate swaps full exposure to the relevant asset class incurred by entering into a derivative contract held in a specific managed portfolio for this purpose at 29 March 2015 is 2.5 billion at 30 March 2014 2.3 billion and the notional value covered by the inflation rate swaps at 29 March 2015 is 1.8 billion at 30 March 2014 1.5 billion.
The spread of investments continues to balance security and growth in order to pay the RMPP benefits when they become due.

Full disclosures are provided in this note even though the balance sheet amounts are not material in the context of the Groups total assets and liabilities.
The purpose of the Groups hedging programmes is to mitigate volatility in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates WKHUHE SURYLGLQJ FHUWDLQW IRU SODQQLQJ 7KHUH DUH QR VLJQLILFDQW FRQFHQWUDWLRQV RI FUHGLW ULVN $FFRXQWLQJ UXOHV UHTXLUH WKe Company to choose whether to designate cash flow hedge programmes or not subject to various tests.

The Group had the following designated cash flow hedge programmes during the current and previous reporting years: Hedging activities i The diesel fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast diesel fuel purchases.
ii The jet fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast jet fuel usage.
iii The air conveyance hedge programme uses US Dollar forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases.
iv Four capital programmes one of which completed during 2013-14, one of which completed during 2014-15 and two of which commenced in 2014-15 use Euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from Sterling Euro exchange rates for contracted capital expenditure on automation projects.

Hedging programmes continued v The electricity hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from electricity prices.
In addition the Group uses fixed rate prices contracts with suppliers to set future prices.
vi The gas hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from gas prices.
vii The interest rate hedge programme uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge the exposure arising from interest rates on borrowings under the s QGLFDWHG EDQN ORDQ IDFLOLWLHV.
The hedge programme finished when the interest rate swap contracts were sold following the repayment on 9 March 2015 of the floating rate term loans.
viii UKPIL trades in SDRs with overseas postal operators for delivering UK origin mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK.
The UKPIL overseas postal operators hedge programme uses US Dollar and Japanese Yen forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the forecast future net purchases of delivery services.
This hedge programme covers the exposure up until the purchases are incurred and recognised on the balance sheet.
The Group had undesignated cash flow hedge programmes for the transactional exposure created by intercompany loans with GLS and the exposure of UKPIL to overseas postal operator liabilities for the period after the purchases have been incurred and recognised on the balance sheet until the time when they are settled.
The derivative balances of these programmes are not material.
The Group uses the 500 million bond as a hedge of the net investment in GLS, against movements in the Sterling Euro exchange rate.
Foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net assets of GLS and of the 500 million bond to closing Sterling Euro exchange rates are deferred in equity.
These exchange differences would be released from equity to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale if GLS were sold.
During the year foreign currency exchange gains on the bond of 27 million 2013-14 nil million were deferred in equity.
There was no ineffectiveness in the hedge during the year.

Current transformation costs provisions of 53 million are expected to be utilised in 2015-16, with the remainder within two to three years.
Specific items The specific items provisions of 154 million at 29 March 2015 2013-14 87 million include 81 million 2013-14 62 million for potential industrial diseases claims relating to both current and former employees of the Group.
Royal Mail Groups liability in respect of former employees arose in 2010 as a result of a Court of Appeal judgement that held the Group liable for diseases claims brought by individuals who were employed in the General Post Office Telecommunications division and whose employment ceased prior to October 1981.
Consequently, a provision was first recognised in 2010-11.
The Group has derived its current provision by using estimates and ranges calculated by its actuary, which are based on current experience of claims, and an assessment of potential future claims, the majority of which are expected to be received over the next 25 to 30 years.
The Group has a rigorous process of ensuring that only valid claims are accepted.
3 million of this provision is expected to be utilised in 2015-16.
The remaining 73 million 2013-14 25 million mainly relates to IT systems costs associated with Post Office Limited separation, of which 9 million is expected to be utilised in 2015-16, and French Competition Authority investigation costs, of which 42 million is expected to be utilised in 2015-16.
An additional 13 million is in respect of a German property tax liability of 4 million, expected to be utilised in 2015-16, and employers National Insurance associated with the award of Employee Free Shares of 9 million, expected to be utilised within two to five years.
The 4 million reclassification relates to a historic provision in respect of legacy property costs and is therefore deemed to be a specific item.
A further 5 million was charged to specific items in the year in relation to this provision.
Of the total provision of 9 million, 1 million is expected to be utilised within two to five years and the remaining 8 million over a period greater than five years.
Other provisions charged as operating costs Other provisions of 43 million 2013-14 45 million mainly comprise onerous lease obligations, decommissioning costs and estimated exposures resulting from legal claims incurred in the normal course of business.
The majority of Other provision amounts are expected to be utilised in 2015-16, with 5 million onerous lease obligations expected to be utilised within two to three years.

In line with the Groups accounting policy see Significant accounting policies, this goodwill has been reviewed for impairment.
The carrying value of GLS, excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and liabilities, is 434 million 2013-14 492 million at 29 March 2015 and the operating profit before transformation costs items is 115 million 2013-14 106 million for the period note 2.
The carrying value of GLS 434 million represents a multiple of 3.8 2013-14 4.6 of operating profit before transformation costs.
The net realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review i. e. the fair value less costs of disposal, has been assessed with reference to earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector of 6.8.
On this basis, the net realisable value has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value.
The earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by more than 57 per cent to 2.9 to reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying value.
