Turnover and Net fees are described in note 1 d and e to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
In performing these tests, assumptions are made in respect of future growth rates and the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows of income-generating units.
These assumptions are set out in note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
PENSION ACCOUNTING Under IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits, the Group has recognised a pension deficit of 58.7 million 2014: 43.9 million.
A number of assumptions have been made in determining the pension deficit and these are described in note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF RECOVERABILITY OF TRADE RECEIVABLES As described in note 17, provisions for impairment of trade receivables have been made.
In reviewing the appropriateness of these provisions, consideration has been given to the ageing of the debt and the potential likelihood of default, taking into account current economic conditions.
ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING Following the acquisition of 80% of the shareholding of Veredus Corp. the Group has considered the specific requirements of IFRS 10 including the application of the substance principle: the fair value of deferred consideration consequently recognised: and the assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired.
These are set out in note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
4SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 OPERATING SEGMENTS IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result, the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Groups turnover by geographic origin and destination.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
NET FEES AND OPERATING PROFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS The Groups Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue in internal reports, rather than use turnover.
This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources.
The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in its internal management reporting.
The full detail of these items can be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 83.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 5.

Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The additions during the year of 35.9 million relate primarily to the acquisition of Veredus Corp. a pure-play IT staffing company based in Florida USA.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows: Assumption How determined Operating profit The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by the Groups Management Board which are compiled using expectations of fee growth, consultant productivity and operating costs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates.
Discount rates The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows range between 9.0% and 13.3% 2014: 13.0% reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the country risks specific to the relevant CGUs.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is generally based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC adjusted for the risk-free rate for 10-year bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities and where appropriate, the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the increased return required over and above a risk-free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
The medium-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with a minimum Growth rates average estimated growth rate of 5.0% 2014: 5.0%, reflecting a combination of both past experience and the macroeconomic environment, including GDP expectations driving fee growth.
The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of 2.0% 2014: 2.0%, reflecting a combination of GDP expectations and long-term wage inflation driving fee growth.
GDP growth is a key driver of our business, and is therefore a key consideration in developing long-term forecasts.
Wage inflation is also an important driver of net fees as net fees are derived directly from the salary level of candidates placed into employment.
Based on past experience a combination of these two factors is considered to be an appropriate basis for assessing long-term growth rates.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in the long-term growth rate from Year 2 onwards between 0% and 2% in absolute terms.
The sensitivity analysis shows no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the CGUs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: In s million 2015 2014 Asia Pacific 19.1 18.8 Continental Europe & Rest of World 86.2 58.7 United Kingdom & Ireland 93.1 93.1 198.4 170.6 Hays plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015|95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 14OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS In s million 2015 2014 Cost At 1 July 91.2 87.7 Exchange adjustments 1.1 1.4 Acquired 3.0 Additions 4.3 6.1 Disposals 4.2 1.2 At 30 June 93.2 91.2 Amortisation At 1 July 54.7 43.3 Exchange adjustments 0.8 0.8 Charge for the year 13.7 12.9 Disposals 4.2 0.7 At 30 June 63.4 54.7 Net book value At 30 June 29.8 36.5 At 1 July 36.5 44.4 Following the acquisition of Veredus Corp. during the year, an intangible asset of 3.0 million has been recognised in respect of the acquired Veredus brand.

INTEREST RATE RISK The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 30 June 2015 the Group had drawn down 100 million 2014: 110 million from its unsecured revolving credit facility.
In 2011 the Group entered into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge this risk.
The fair value of these derivatives at 30 June 2015 was nil 2014: 0.1 million.
The interest rate profile of bank loans and overdrafts is as follows: In s million 2015 2014 Floating rate sterling 100.5 110.7 The floating rate liabilities comprise bank loans and unsecured overdrafts bearing interest at rates based on local market rates.
COMMITTED FACILITIES The Group completed the refinancing of its five-year unsecured revolving credit facility on 23 April 2015.
The new arrangement includes a reduction in the core debt facility from 300 million to 210 million and an extension in maturity to April 2020.
The financial covenants remain unchanged and require the Groups interest cover ratio to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA to be no greater than 2.5:1.
The interest rate of the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 0.90% to 1.55%.
At 30 June 2015, 110 million of the committed facility was undrawn.
INTEREST RATES The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2015 2014 Bank borrowings 2.5% 2.8% For each 10 basis point fall or rise in the average LIBOR rate in the year there would be a reduction or increase in profit before tax by approximately 0.1 million.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Boards priorities for free cash flow are to fund the Groups investment and development, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver a sustainable dividend at a level that is affordable and appropriate.
The Board targets a dividend cover range of 2.0x to 3.0x, and remains committed to paying a sustainable and progressive dividend.
Further details can be found in the Financial Review on page 33.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents note 18, bank loans and overdrafts note 19 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 23 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group did not have a material income statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2015.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposure.
The Groups operating profit exposure to foreign currency translation is primarily in respect of the Euro and the Australian Dollar.
The sensitivity of a 1 cent change in the average exchange rates for the year in respect of the Euro and Australian Dollar would result in a 0.6 million and 0.2 million change in operating profit respectively.

Hays plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015|101 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes in the UK and in other countries including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The Groups principal schemes are operated within the UK where the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
UK DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEME The Groups principal defined contribution retirement benefit scheme is the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan which is operated for all qualifying employees and is funded via an employee salary sacrifice arrangement, and for qualifying employees additional employer contributions.
Employer contributions are in the range of 4% to 15% of pensionable salary depending on the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 6.2 million 2014: 5.9 million represents employers contributions payable to the money purchase arrangements.
Contributions of 0.5 million 2014: 0.5 million were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the money purchase arrangements are held separately from those of the Group.
UK DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES The Groups principal defined benefit schemes are the Hays Pension Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Scheme both in the UK.
The Hays Pension Scheme is a funded final salary defined benefit scheme providing pensions and death benefits to members.
The Hays Supplementary Scheme is an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The Schemes were closed to future accrual from 30 June 2012 with pensions calculated up until the point of closure.
The Schemes are governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Group and is subject to full actuarial valuation on a triennial basis.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2012 and quantified the deficit at c. 150 million.
A revised deficit funding schedule was agreed with effect from 1 July 2012 which maintained the annual contribution at 13.1 million, subject to a 3% per annum fixed uplift over a period reduced to just under 10 years.
During the year the Group made a contribution of 13.5 million to the Hays Pension Scheme 2014: 13.1 million in accordance with the agreed deficit funding schedule.
The cash contributions during the year mainly related to deficit funding payments.

The key assumptions used at 30 June 2015 are listed below.
2015 2014 Discount rate 3.8% 4.4% RPI inflation 3.3% 3.4% CPI inflation 2.3% 2.4% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.2% 3.3% Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.3% 2.4% The discount rate has been constructed as a gilt yield of 2.8% per annum 2014: 3.5% plus a credit spread on high-quality debt instruments of 1.0% per annum 2014: 0.9%.
The gilt yield of 2.8% is the flat yield equivalent to valuing the liabilities of the gilt curve published by the Bank of England.
The RPI inflation assumption has been set as gilt market implied RPI appropriate to the duration of the liabilities circa 23 years less a 0.2% per annum inflation risk premium.
This approach is consistent with last year.
The life expectancy assumptions have been calculated using Club Vita base tables and future improvements in line with the CMI 2011 model with a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% per annum and non peaked short-term future improvements.
On this basis a 65-year-old current pensioner has a life expectancy of 24.6 years and 25.9 years for males and females respectively.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the Schemes liabilities at the year end is: Change in Impact on assumption Schemes Discount rate 0.5% 83m RPI inflation 0.5% 52m Assumed life expectancy at age 65 rate of mortality 1 year 21m The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation to one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

PSP awards are discretionary and vesting is dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over either a three-year period or a one-year period with a two-year holding period.
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management Board participate in the DAB which promotes a stronger link between short-term and long-term performance through the deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a three-year period.

Net assets acquired after fair value adjustments were 10.0 million.
The deferred consideration is subject to a put call arrangement which provides Hays with an option to acquire the remaining 20% of the equity from the shareholders who have an equivalent right to sell the remaining 20% of the equity.
The option is first available for exercise in March 2018 at a pre-determined multiple of earnings, and is subject to a cap.
The maximum potential amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is 27.6 million.
Fair value adjustments to the net assets acquired relate mainly to the recognition of an intangible asset in respect of the acquired Veredus brand as described in note 14 to the financial statements.
The acquired business contributed 33.8 million turnover, 10.0 million net fees and 0.3 million operating profit to the Group results before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
This was in line with expectations with a good trading performance offset by the amortisation of the legacy brand, one off costs related to the transaction, and post-acquisition development of the business.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group turnover for the year would have increased by 25.9 million, net fees would have increased by 8.1 million and operating profit by 2.2 million.
