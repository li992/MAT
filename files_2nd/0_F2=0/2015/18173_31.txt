NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 1 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS The consolidated Financial Statements of Computacenter plc Parent Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 11 March 2016.
The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and FA Conophy.
Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded.
The Groups Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS as they apply to the Financial Statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company, using existing GAAP in each country of operation.
Adjustments are made on consolidation for differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group no longer retains control.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
Adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.

95 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Managements assessment of the impact and accepted best practice is ongoing.
Certain of these standards and interpretations will, when adopted, require addition to or amendment of disclosures in the accounts.
With the exception of IFRS 15, it is not anticipated that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups accounts.
Management is currently assessing the implication of IFRS 15 on the Group Financial Statements but has not yet formed a conclusion.
Critical judgements and estimates The preparation of Financial Statements requires Management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
Critical Estimates Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
The areas involving significant risk resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Impairment of intangible assets, goodwill and other non-current assets Determining whether goodwill, intangible assets and other non-current assets are impaired requires an estimation of their recoverable amount which is the higher of either the value in use to the cash-generating units CGU to which these assets belong or the fair value less costs of disposal.
The value in use calculation requires appropriate forecasts of future cash flows expected to arise for the CGU and the selection of suitable discount rates and future growth rates.
The Group reviews impairment of these assets at least on an annual basis, or more frequently if there is an indicator of impairment.
Further detail on the impairment testing of intangible assets, goodwill and non-current assets is disclosed in note 15.
Provisions Provisions are established by the Group based on Managements assessment of relevant information and advice available at the time of preparing the Financial Statements.
Outcomes are uncertain and dependent on future events.
Where outcomes differ from Managements expectations, differences from the amount initially provided will impact the income statement in the year the outcome is determined.
As disclosed in note 24, the Groups provisions principally relate to obligations arising from onerous lease property provisions, customer contract provisions, restructuring provisions and retirement benefit obligations.
Further details of specific estimates used in arriving at these provisions are provided in the note.
Providing for doubtful debts The Group provides services and equipment to business and public sector customers, mainly on credit terms.
Management know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers.
Estimates, based on our historical experience, are used in determining the level of debts that we believe will not be collected.
These estimates include such factors as the current state of the economy, particular industry issues and the individual credit risk assessed against each customer.
Refer to note 25 for further details on credit risk.
The value of the provision for doubtful debts is disclosed in note 18.
Taxation In arriving at the current and deferred tax liability the Group has taken account of tax issues that are subject to ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
Liabilities have been calculated based on Managements assessment of relevant information and advice.
Where outcomes differ from the amounts initially recorded, such differences impact current and deferred tax amounts in the year the outcome is determined.
Further details on the deferred tax balances held at 31 December 2015 are disclosed in note 9d.
Revenue recognition For a limited number of Services contracts, an estimate of the total contract costs and total contract revenues is required to determine the stage of completion.
The Group accounts for these contracts using the  units of work method, recognising revenue and direct costs as performance on the contract progresses through the recorded utilisation of our services.
This method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion of the contract and may involve estimates on the scope of services required for fulfilling the contractually defined obligations.
These significant estimates include total contract costs, total contract revenues, contract risks, including technical risks, and other judgements.
Under the  method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease in revenue recognised at a point in time.
When the outcome of the contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent that expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration.
Critical Judgements Judgements made by Management in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements: Exceptional items Management is required to exercise its judgement in the classification of certain items as exceptional and outside of the Groups adjusted results.
96 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Management have considered the materiality, infrequency and nature of the French Social Plan against the requirements and guidance provided by IAS 1, our Group accounting policies and recent press releases from the Financial Reporting Council FRC.
Management judged that classifying the scale and transformative nature of the restructuring programme in France and the subsequent expense related to the French Social Plan as an exceptional item in the income statement provides the best guidance as to the underlying profitability trends within the Group and to present the results of the Group in accordance with the policy above.
During 2015 the reversal of the unutilised portion of the onerous Services contracts provision was classified as an exceptional item as the original expense relating to the provision was classified as such in 2013.
Asset held for sale At the time of approving the 2014 year-end Annual Report and Accounts, Management made a judgement in deciding that the sale of its subsidiary, RDC, should not be accounted for as an asset held for sale under the Groups relevant accounting policy disclosed later in this note.
Management considered the timeline of events from the unsolicited enquiry from the purchaser near the end of the reporting year through to the rapid conclusion of the sale process on 2 February 2015, amongst other factors, when making the judgement.
Management had neither a programme for the disposal of the asset or a plan to market RDC for sale to any other party during 2014 or 2015.
The sale process began following the purchasers opportunistic approach in late 2014.
Management did not consider the sale of RDC probable at the end of 2014 reporting year, based on the stage of discussions with the purchaser.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold buildings 25-50 years Short leasehold improvements shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Fixtures and fittings Head office 5-15 years Other shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Office machinery, computer hardware 2-15 years Motor vehicles 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investment property Investment property is defined as land and or buildings held by the Group to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in the supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
The Group recognises any part of an owned or leased under a finance lease property that is leased to third-parties as investment property, unless it represents an insignificant portion of the property.
Investment property is measured initially at cost including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group elects to measure investment property at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any i. e. applying the same accounting policies including useful lives as for property, plant and equipment.
The fair values, which reflect the market conditions as at the balance sheet date, are disclosed in note 13.
Intangible assets Software and software licences Software and software licences include computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Currently software is amortised over four years.
97 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Software under development Costs that are incurred and that can be specifically attributed to the development phase of management information systems for internal use are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, once the asset becomes available for use.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are carried initially at fair value.
Following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative expenses as follows: Existing customer contracts 5 years Existing customer relationships 10 years Tools and technology 7 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 Revised using the purchase method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGU monitored by Management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where an asset does not have independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is assessed for the CGU to which it belongs.
Certain other corporate assets are unable to be allocated against specific CGUs.
These assets are tested across an aggregation of CGUs that utilise the asset.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the Group estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognised.
The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
As the Group has no assets carried at revalued amounts, such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Investment in associates The Groups interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
The Groups income statement reflects the share of the associates results after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised in the other comprehensive income of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any such change in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
Costs include those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
98 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financial assets Financial assets are recognised at their fair value which initially equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable transaction costs associated with the investment.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described in each category below: Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day credit terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise deposits held for a term of greater than three months from the date of deposit and which are not available to the Group on demand.
Subsequent to initial measurement, current asset investments are measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in each category below: Interest-bearing borrowings All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations affecting cash flows from forecasted transactions and unrecognised firm commitments.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instruments fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are addressed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting years for which they are designated.
Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.
Cash flow hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in administrative expenses.
99 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Amounts recognised within other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement, within administrative expenses, when the hedged transaction affects the income statement, such as when the hedged financial expense is recognised.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement within administrative expenses.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised within other comprehensive income remains within other comprehensive income until after the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects the income statement.
Any other gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to administrative expenses in the income statement.
Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the material overseas subsidiaries are Euro, US Dollar US$, South African Rand ZAR and Swiss Franc CHF.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date and their Income Statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Customer contract provisions Managed Services revenue includes revenue from Support Services and Managed Services contracts.
On a limited number of these contracts revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis which is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
If the performance of one of these limited number of contracts results in a margin that was less than anticipated at the time that it was agreed then the future financial performance of that contract will be reviewed in detail.
If, after further financial analysis, the full financial consequence of the contract can be reliably estimated, and it is determined that the contract is potentially loss-making, then the best estimate of the losses expected to be incurred until the end of the contract will be provided for.
The Group has elected to apply IAS 11 in its assessment of whether contracts are considered onerous and in subsequently estimating the provision as IAS 18 considers the requirements of IAS 11 are generally applicable to the recognition of revenue and the associated expenses for a transaction involving the rendering of services.
A contract that is accounted for under IAS 11 that is considered potentially onerous is assessed according to the recognition of expected losses in IAS 11 ahead of the onerous contract guidance in IAS 37 and considers total estimated costs i. e. directly attributable variable costs and fixed allocated costs as included in the assessment of whether the contract is onerous or not and in the measurement of the provision.
Restructuring provisions The Group recognises a restructuring provision when there is a programme planned and controlled by Management that materially changes the scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted.
Further to the Groups general provision recognition policy, a restructuring provision is only considered when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring identifying, as a minimum, the business or part of the business concerned: the principal locations affected: the location, function and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services: the expenditures that will be undertaken and when the plan will be implemented.
The Group will only recognise a specific restructuring provision once a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
100 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 The Group only includes incremental costs associated directly with the restructuring within the restructuring provisions such as employee termination benefits and consulting fees.
The Group specifically excludes from recognition in a restructuring provision any costs associated with ongoing activities such as the costs of training or relocating staff that are redeployed within the business rather than retrenched and costs for employees who continue to be employed in ongoing operations, regardless of the status of these operations post-restructure.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme available to all UK employees.
Contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
There are no material pension schemes within the Groups overseas operations.
The Group has an obligation to make a one-off payment to French employees upon retirement, the Indemnits fide Fin fide Carrire IFC.
French employment law requires that a company pays employees a one-time contribution when and only when the employee leaves the Company for retirement at the mandatory age.
This is a legal requirement for all businesses who incur the obligation upon departure, due to retirement, of an employee.
Typically the retirement benefit is based on length of service of the employee and his or her salary at retirement.
The amount is set via a legal minimum but the retirement premiums can be improved by the collective agreement or employment contract in some cases.
In Computacenter France, the payment is based on accrued service and ranges from 1 month of salary after 5 years service to 9.4 months of salary after 47 years of service.
If the employee leaves voluntarily at any point before retirement, all liability is extinguished and any accrued service is not transferred to any new employment.
Management continues to account for this obligation according to IAS 19 revised.
Due to the materiality of the obligation, Management considers no further disclosures are relevant at this time.
Taxation Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in the future against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Sales tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the relevant taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authorities are included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts and rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Supply Chain Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of goods.
101 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Professional Services Revenue is recognised under a contract following delivery of a service or with reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
Unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If the total estimated costs and revenues of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
A provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
Managed Services Managed Services revenue is recognised over the term of the contract as services are delivered.
Unearned Managed Services revenue is included within deferred income in the balance sheet.
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one year are deferred and recognised over the relevant period.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate and revenue thereon is measured at the fair value of the consideration received.
The related costs are recognised as they are incurred.
However, a portion of costs incurred in the initial phase of outsourcing contracts transition and or transformation costs may be deferred when they are specific to a given contract and or will generate future economic benefits, and are recoverable.
These costs are allocated to work-in-progress and any reimbursement by the client is recorded as a deduction from the costs incurred.
On a limited number of Managed Services contracts revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis which is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is restricted to the extent that it is probable that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Bid and set-up costs The Group operates in a highly competitive environment and is frequently involved in contract bids with multiple competitors with the outcome usually unknown until the contract is awarded and signed.
Any bid costs incurred by the Groups Central Bid Management Engines are not capitalised or charged to the contract, but instead directly charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as they are incurred.
These costs associated with bids are not separately identifiable nor can they be measured reliably as the Groups internal bid teams work across multiple bids at any one time.
Further, it cannot be assessed as probable that the contract will be obtained until the tender process has completed and the contract has been awarded.
Finance income Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Operating lease income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including Executive Directors of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 28.
In valuing equitysettled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
As the schemes do not include any market related performance conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share see note 10.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction from equity see note 27.
Own shares held Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
102 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Fair value measurement The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed, are summarised in note 25.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified separately as held for sale in the Balance Sheet when their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when: the sale is highly probable: the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition: Management have an approved programme to market and sell the asset or an approved plan for disposal: and Management is committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Liabilities directly associated with the assets classified as held for sale and expected to be included as part of the sale transaction are correspondingly also classified separately.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not subject to depreciation or amortisation.
The net assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is considered to be a component of the Group that has either been disposed of, or that is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate line of business or geographical area of operations.
Adjusted measures The Group uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group.
Adjusted revenue, adjusted Services revenue, adjusted Professional Services revenue, adjusted Supply Chain revenue, and adjusted administrative expenses excludes the revenue and administrative expenses from a disposed subsidiary, RDC, for both the current year and the comparative reporting year.
Adjusted operating profit or loss, adjusted profit or loss before tax, adjusted profit or loss for the year, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share are, as appropriate, each stated before: exceptional and other adjusting items including gain or loss on business disposals, amortisation of acquired intangibles, utilisation of deferred tax assets where initial recognition was as an exceptional item or a fair value adjustment on acquisition, and the related tax effect of these exceptional and other adjusting items, as Management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of the segment or the Group as a whole.
Each of these measures also excludes the results of RDC for both the current and comparative periods.
Additionally, adjusted operating profit or loss includes the interest paid on customer-specific financing CSF which Management considers to be a cost of sale.
A reconciliation between key adjusted and statutory measures is provided on page 40 of the Group Finance Directors review.
Further detail is also provided within note 3, segment information.
103 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 3 SEGMENT INFORMATION For Management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical segments, with each segment determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate statutory entities.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the below reportable operating segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its geographical segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profit or loss which is measured differently from statutory operating profit or loss in the consolidated Financial Statements as defined above.
Segmental performance for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 was as follows: Year ended 31 December 2015 UK Germany France Belgium Total 000 000 000 000 000 Revenue Adjusted Supply Chain revenue 875,041 820,196 335,024 33,686 2,063,947 Adjusted Services revenue Adjusted Professional Services revenue 137,390 107,416 16,101 1,645 262,552 Managed Services revenue 394,943 272,006 46,934 13,785 727,668 Total adjusted Services revenue 532,333 379,422 63,035 15,430 990,220 Total adjusted revenue 1,407,374 1,199,618 398,059 49,116 3,054,167 RDC Supply Chain revenue 3,158 3,158 Professional Services revenue 290 290 Total RDC revenue 3,448 3,448 Statutory revenue 1,410,822 1,199,618 398,059 49,116 3,057,615 Results Adjusted gross profit 216,445 147,346 32,083 6,258 402,132 Adjusted administrative expenses 157,110 119,937 33,715 4,263 315,025 Adjusted operating profit loss 59,335 27,409 1,632 1,995 87,107 Adjusted net interest 601 577 178 79 233 Adjusted profit loss before tax 59,936 26,832 1,810 1,916 86,874 Exceptional items: onerous contracts trading losses 1,123 1,123 onerous contracts provision for future losses 1,559 1,559 exceptional losses on redundancy and other restructuring costs 1,465 1,465 Total exceptional items 436 1,465 1,029 Exceptional gain on disposal of a subsidiary 42,155 42,155 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 361 1,116 76 1,553 RDC 320 320 Statutory profit loss before tax 102,050 26,152 3,275 1,840 126,767 104 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 The reconciliation for adjusted operating profit to statutory operating profit as disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement is as follows: UK Germany France Belgium Total 000 000 000 000 000 Adjusted operating profit loss 59,335 27,409 1,632 1,995 87,107 Add back interest on CSF 56 284 340 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 361 1,116 76 1,553 Exceptional items 436 1,465 1,029 RDC 320 320 Statutory operating profit loss 59,350 27,013 3,097 1,919 85,185 Other segment information Property, plant and equipment 34,037 14,286 7,210 1,599 57,132 Investment property 10,260 10,260 Intangible assets 63,173 16,520 56 1,784 81,533 Capital expenditure: Property, plant and equipment 5,904 5,224 1,307 868 13,303 Software 6,052 1,186 50 6 7,294 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 10,667 6,121 1,687 410 18,885 Depreciation of investment property 227 227 Amortisation of software 11,059 635 59 5 11,758 Share-based payments 4,095 542 33 4,670 105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 3 SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 UK Germany France Belgium Total 000 000 000 000 000 Revenue Adjusted Supply Chain revenue 878,145 774,913 393,406 34,580 2,081,044 Adjusted Services revenue Adjusted Professional Services revenue 125,610 108,950 19,752 2,113 256,425 Managed Services revenue 368,663 283,203 57,957 15,979 725,802 Total adjusted Services revenue 494,273 392,153 77,709 18,092 982,227 Total adjusted revenue 1,372,418 1,167,066 471,115 52,672 3,063,271 RDC Supply Chain revenue 41,197 41,197 Professional Services revenue 3,291 3,291 Total RDC revenue 44,488 44,488 Statutory revenue 1,416,906 1,167,066 471,115 52,672 3,107,759 Results Adjusted gross profit 209,555 151,682 31,757 6,120 399,114 Adjusted administrative expenses 148,827 124,906 40,592 4,057 318,382 Adjusted operating profit loss 60,728 26,776 8,835 2,063 80,732 Adjusted net interest 929 452 929 125 327 Adjusted profit loss before tax 61,657 27,228 9,764 1,938 81,059 Exceptional items: onerous contracts trading losses 3,824 3,824 onerous contracts provision for future losses 5,364 5,364 exceptional losses on redundancy and restructuring costs 9,128 9,128 Total exceptional items 1,540 9,128 7,588 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 551 1,232 85 1,868 RDC 4,815 4,815 Statutory profit loss before tax 65,921 27,536 18,892 1,853 76,418 Subsequent to the disposal of RDC, Management does not consider the results of RDC when reviewing the results of its Segments or Group as a whole.

An exceptional gain of 42.2 million was recognised on the disposal.
In line with our accounting policy, Management has elected under IAS 1 to report this gain as a separate line item on the face of the consolidated income statement due to the materiality, infrequency and nature of this gain.
As noted within the summary of significant accounting policies the adjusted results exclude this gain.
This election provides the best guidance to users of our external reporting as to the underlying profitability trends within the Group and to present the results of the Group in a way that is fair, balanced and understandable.
Computacenter France continued with its substantial restructuring exercise that began in 2014.
An additional cost of 1.5 million has been recognised as part of the Social Plan.
As the redundancy and restructuring costs were treated as an exceptional item on recognition, the further provision has also been treated as an exceptional item.
Within this balance Management has provided for legal expenses of 0.4 million directly related to individual legal challenges to termination settlements provided under the Social Plan.
The Groups remaining two onerous contracts continue to show operational improvements therefore Management has revised its estimates of the losses to be incurred.
On this basis the Group has released 0.4 million of the provision.
As the onerous contracts were treated as an exceptional item on recognition, the write back of the provision has also been released as an exceptional item.
108 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 2014: Included within the prior year are the following exceptional items: Computacenter France incurred an exceptional charge of 9.1 million relating to the estimated costs of a comprehensive restructuring plan with the Groups French business.
The substantial restructuring exercise aimed to reduce the cost base, improve the competitiveness and therefore improve the profitability of the Groups French business.
In line with our accounting policy, Management elected under IAS 1 to report this provision under the heading of Exceptional Items due to the materiality, infrequency and nature of the restructuring plan.
Excluding the costs related to the restructuring plan is consistent with treatment of similar costs in prior years and presents the adjusted profit before tax in a way that enables users to better assess the quality of the Groups underlying profitability.
The Groups three onerous contracts performed within the provisions previously taken, and one of these contracts came to an end as of 30 September 2014.
A related legal dispute with a sub-contractor on one of these contracts, that was previously provided for, was resolved.
Given these factors and ongoing operational improvements within the two remaining contracts, Management revised its estimates of the losses to be incurred.
On this basis the Group released 1.5 million of the provision.
As the onerous contracts were treated as an exceptional item on recognition, the write back of the provision was also released as an exceptional item.

10 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share EPS amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held.
To calculate diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.

The fair value of investment property amounted to 13.5 million at 31 December 2015.
The fair values for disclosure purposes have been determined using either the support of qualified independent external valuers or by internal valuers with the necessary recognised and relevant professional qualification, applying a combination of the present value of future cash flows and observable market values of comparable properties.

To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by Senior Management covering a three-year period and on long-term market growth rates of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent 2014: between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for all CGUs for 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 are: budgeted revenue, which is based on long-run market growth forecasts: budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections ranges from 11.0 to 15.0 per cent 2014: 11.0 to 15.0 per cent which represents the Groups pre-tax discount rate adjusted for the risk profiles of the individual CGUs.
Each CGU generates value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each of them.
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer relationships and tools and technology.
The expected useful lives are shown in note 2.
Other non-current assets When there is an indication of impairment within a CGU, the carrying value of the non-current assets are compared to their recoverable amount which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs of disposal or the value-in-use of the CGU calculated as described above.
In France, a shortfall from the financial budgets approved by Management, or adverse changes in the assumptions, such as a 0.5 per cent reduction in market growth rate or an increase in the discount rate of 0.5 per cent would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.

Computacenter plc is the ultimate parent entity of the Group.
Disposal of subsidiary On 2 February 2015, the Group announced that it had disposed of its wholly-owned IT disposal and recycling subsidiary, RDC.
The Group reached agreement with Arrow Electronics UK Holding Limited for the disposal of the entire issued share capital of RDC.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, RDC generated revenues of 3.5 million 2014: 22.8 million and statutory profit before tax of 0.3 million 2014: 4.8 million.
The net assets of RDC, including cash of 3.8 million, were disposed of for a gross consideration of 59.9 million in cash to the Group.
This generated an exceptional gain of 42.2 million.
The net assets of RDC at the date of disposal were as follows: 2015 000 Property, plant and equipment 4,115 Intangible assets software 1,121 Inventories 7,078 Trade and other receivables 4,330 Prepayments 361 Cash and short-term deposits 3,829 Trade and other payables 3,699 Income tax payable 327 Attributable goodwill 835 Total net assets 17,643 Gain on disposal 42,155 Total consideration, net of disposal costs 59,798 Net cash inflow arising on disposal: Consideration received in cash and cash equivalents 59,798 Less: cash and cash equivalents disposed of 3,829 55,969 For the full results of RDC for the year, refer to page 46 of this Annual Report and Accounts.
Update on acquisition made in 2011 On 21 July 2011, the Group acquired 80 per cent of Computacenter AG in Switzerland for an initial consideration of CHF 7.2 million, and agreed to purchase the remaining 20 per cent by mid-2015 for a maximum consideration of CHF 3.2 million dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance criteria during that period.
Due to the nature of the transaction, the Group had access to the benefits associated with the remaining 20 per cent of Damax.
Therefore the Group recorded this acquisition as a linked transaction, and accordingly consolidated 100 per cent of the results of Damax since the acquisition date and estimated the fair value of the deferred consideration payable.
During the year, Damax achieved the agreed performance criteria which triggered the maximum consideration payable of 3.2 million CHF by the Group.
The Group has paid the 3.2 million CHF during the year to the previous owner of the business.
Details of the book and fair values of the net assets acquired are disclosed in note 16 of the December 2011 Annual Report and Accounts.

22 FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS 2015 2014 000 000 Financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss Foreign exchange forward contracts 358 2,296 Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange forward contracts 940 251 1,298 2,045 Cash flow hedges Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income These amounts reflect the change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges which are used to hedge expected contract costs in South African Rand where sales on those contracts are in Sterling, based on highly probable forecast transactions.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss The Group also enters into other foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to reduce the foreign exchange risk of expected sales and purchases.
When these other contracts are not designated in hedge relationships they are measured at fair value through profit and loss within administrative expenses.
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency costs and changes in the foreign exchange forward rates.
Effectiveness of Hedging The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated for the expected highly probable forecast transactions to which hedge accounting has been applied.
No significant element of hedge ineffectiveness required recognition in the income statement.
The cash flow hedges of the forecasted costs were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised gain of 940,000 2014: loss of 251,000 with a deferred tax liability of 190,000 2014: asset of 54,000 relating to the hedging instruments is included in other comprehensive income.
The amounts retained in other comprehensive income of 947,000 are expected to mature and affect the income statement between 2016 and 2018.

Whilst there continues to be uncertainty around the future performance of these contracts and the exact timing of cash flows, this uncertainty continues to decrease due to the Groups experience in running these particular contracts.
Management remains comfortable with the level of the provision.
One of the three contracts ended during the final quarter of 2015 leaving only two provided for at 31 December 2015.
The initial contracted periods for both of these contracts are due to complete during 2016, with one completing in the first half of the year and the other in the second.
Property provisions Assumptions used to calculate the property provisions are based on the market value of the rental charges plus any contractual dilapidation expenses on empty properties and the Directors best estimates of the likely time before the relevant leases can be reassigned or sub-let, which ranges between one and fifteen years.
The provisions in relation to the UK properties are discounted at a rate based upon the Bank of England base rate.
Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.
Other provisions Included within other provisions are estimated costs associated with elements of the comprehensive transformation of the Groups French business.
These included costs relate specifically to a material change in the employment base across the French Business known as the Social Plan.
The nature of the costs previously provided for include termination payments and retraining and resettlement costs for redundant employees.
Management implementation of the plan is largely complete with the individuals included within the Social Plan no longer working for the French business and the majority of the overall cash flows of the costs provided for have been completed by the end of 2015.
The costs provided for during 2015 primarily include further entrants to the Social Plan who have been added during the year.
The majority of the future cash flows of the costs provided at year end are expected to occur during 2016.
The provision is based inter alia on assumptions concerning the duration of individual settlement payment programmes and the uptake of retraining and resettlement packages.
As disclosed last year, there remains some residual uncertainty relating to individual legal challenges to the implementation of the Social Plan.
These uncertainties arise both from technical arguments around whether the Social Plan process followed was procedurally correct and had pre-existing approval from the multiple, potentially interested, regulatory authorities and also from a challenge as to whether Computacenter France was damaging to the overall Group competitiveness and economic performance.
Having taken independent legal advice on this matter Management has applied judgements which it considers reasonable in establishing the required provision.
Management has provided for legal expenses of 0.4 million directly related to these individual legal challenges to termination settlements provided under the Social Plan.
Also included within other provisions is a provision against the Groups retirement benefit obligations in France under the Indemnits fide Fin fide Carrire IFC as described in note 2.
Economic outflows under the obligation only occur if eligible employees reach the statutory retirement age whilst still in employment.
The Group made no payments during 2015 under this obligation 2014: 16,000.
In estimating the provision required, Management is required to make a number of assumptions.
The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows, the turnover rate of employed personnel and rate of salary increases over the length of their projected employment.
The level of unrealised actuarial gains or losses are sensitive to changes in the discount rate, which is affected by market conditions and therefore subject to variation.
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2015 in respect of the Groups French retirement benefit obligations under the IFC was 3.3 million 2014: 3.4 million.
25 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Group Finance Directors review on pages 39 to 47. Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits.
The credit limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
The balance of trade receivables relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, current asset investment and forward currency contracts, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group manages its counterparty credit risk by placing cash on deposit across a panel of reputable banking institutions, with no more than 50.0 million deposited at any one time except for UK Government backed counterparties where the limit is 70.0 million.
Aside from the counterparty risk above, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, cash and short-term deposits and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, existing committed and uncommitted facilities and deposits are at floating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
If long-term borrowings were to be utilised in the future, the Groups policy would be to maintain these borrowings at fixed rates to limit the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
123 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 25 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
Effect on profit Change in before tax basis points 000 2015 Sterling 25 146 Euro 25 138 US Dollars 25 33 2014 Sterling 25 255 Euro 25 61 The impact of a reasonable possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the profit before tax of the same magnitude.
Fair values The carrying value of the Groups short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The fair value of all other financial instruments carried within the Groups Financial Statements is not materially different from their carrying amount.
Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2015 the Group held foreign exchange contracts as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected payments to suppliers.
The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The terms of these contracts are detailed below: 31 December 2015 Buy currency Sell currency Value of contracts Maturity dates Contract rates UK Euros Sterling 4,550,469 Jan 16 Jun 16 1.342 1.366 Sterling US Dollars 2,226,626 Jan 16 Mar 16 1.475 1.482 Sterling Euros 7,464,998 Jan 16 Feb 16 1.354 1.423 Sterling Swiss Francs 473,269 Jan 16 Jun 16 1.459 1.470 Sterling Hungarian Forint 656,637 Jan 16 428.028 US Dollars Sterling $31,721,780 Jan 16 Apr 16 1.475 1.553 Sterling Swedish Krona 647,151 Jan 16 12.462 Hungarian Forint Sterling HUF 488,000,000 Jan 16 Oct 17 428.155 430.009 SA Rand Sterling ZAR 247,766,652 Jan 16 Dec 17 19.465 23.062 US Dollars Euros $4,000,000 Jan 16 1.089 Germany US Dollars Euros $52,525,000 Jan 16 Apr 16 1.0635 1.3107 Hungarian Forint Euros HUF 651,000,000 Jan 16 Oct 16 321.00 323.58 31 December 2014 Buy currency Sell currency Value of contracts Maturity dates Contract rates UK Euros Sterling 2,039,624 Jan 15 1.2513 1.2678 Sterling US Dollars 2,747,873 Jan 15 Feb 15 1.5517 1.5756 Sterling Euros 8,371,469 Jan 15 Feb 16 1.2504 1.2786 US Dollars Sterling $38,241,444 Jan 15 Apr 15 1.5529 1.6342 Danish Kroner Sterling DKK 207,744 Jan 15 9.4749 Swiss Francs Sterling CHF 500,00 Apr 15 1.5384 HK Dollars Sterling HKD 400,000 Jan 15 12.0909 Hungarian Forint Sterling HUF 407,200,000 Jan 15 Jul 16 394.8716 398.0425 SA Rand Sterling ZAR 374,143,726 Jan 15 Dec 17 17.3776 21.5534 Germany US Dollars Euros $69,885,000 Jan 15 Jan 16 1.2163 1.3445 Hungarian Forint Euros HUF 1,103,500,000 Jan 15 Jan 18 321.00 323.58 France Hungarian Forint Euros HUF 628,969,730 Jan 15 Oct 15 309.7486 319.77 124 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 The gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the above contracts are detailed in note 22.
Exchange rate sensitivity The majority of the transactions in each of the Groups geographical segments are denominated in the functional currency of that segment.
There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists.
In these instances the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk.
At the end of the year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was a net asset of 1,298,000 2014: 2,045,000.
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Groups functional currency, reasonably foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of 10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Groups profit before tax or equity.
Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2015 Financial liabilities 90 1,583 2,340 2,171 6,184 Derivative financial instruments 574 338 10 922 Trade and other payables 581,855 581,855 90 584,012 2,678 2,181 588,961 On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2014 Financial liabilities 1,004 2,226 4,128 3,602 10,960 Derivative financial instruments 114 222 53 389 Trade and other payables 638,662 638,662 1,004 641,002 4,350 3,655 650,011 Fair value measurements recognised in the consolidated balance sheet Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Derivative financial instruments forward currency contracts At 31 December 2015 the Group had forward currency contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of a net asset of 1,298,000 31 December 2014: 2,045,000.
The realised gains from forward currency contracts in the year to 31 December 2015 of 747,000 2014: 4,405,000 loss, are offset by broadly equivalent realised losses on the related underlying transactions.
26 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
Consistent with the Groups aim to maximise return to shareholders, the Companys Dividend Policy is to maintain a dividend cover of between 2 to 2.5 times.
In 2015 the cover was 2.5 times, on an adjusted profit basis 2014: 2.5 times.
The Groups capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements.
The Group seeks to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash flow.
As a consequence, the UK has sourced an increasing proportion of its product business via distributors in order to reduce the working capital requirements of the business.
Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Groups exposure to exchange rates.
Each country finances its own working capital requirements, typically resulting in borrowings in France with cash on deposit in the UK and Germany.
During 2013, a notional cash pooling arrangement was introduced, which is still in place, which Group companies can access and allows the Group to pool its funds.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases, which are secured only on the assets that they 4 finance, or loans.
Whilst the outstanding amounts of this CSF are included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes 4 this CSF when managing the net funds of the business as this outstanding financing is matched by committed future revenues.
These financing facilities, which are committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Groups product resale and services activities.
125 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 26 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CONTINUED In certain circumstances, the Group deposits its funds in short-term investments that do not fulfil the criteria to be classified as cash and cash 4 equivalents.
The Group considers these deposits when managing the net funds of the business, and accordingly includes these deposits within net 4 funds excluding CSF.
4 Capital, defined as net funds, that the Group monitors is: 2015 2014 000 000 4 Net funds excluding CSF 126,675 128,509 CSF 5,887 9,312 4 Net funds 120,788 119,197 Each operating country manages its working capital in line with Group policies.
The key components of working capital, i. e. trade receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget process, in order to ensure efficient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital efficiently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour at an Account Manager and Account Director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level.
This is achieved by increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.
The Group regularly reviews the adequacy of its facilities against any foreseeable peak borrowing requirement.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had available 13.7 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities 2014: 16.1 million of uncommitted overdraft and factoring facilities.

Issued under the terms of the Computacenter Performance Share Plan 2006, as amended at the AGM held on 13 May 2011.
One-quarter of the shares will vest if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 5 per cent per annum.
One-half of the shares will vest if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 7.5 per cent and will vest in full if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 10 per cent.
If the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period is between 5 and 10 per cent, shares awarded will vest on a straight-line basis.
The performance period usually covers a period of three years from 1 January of the year the award is granted.
A limited number of PSP awards are granted with a performance period of two years.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the recent historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
