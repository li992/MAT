The principal accounting policies are set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the year.
The principal activity of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc the Company is to act as a holding company.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has not presented its own statement of total recognised gains and losses for the year as there are no separate gains or losses arising in the year.
Going concern The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the Business Review.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are all described in the Trading and Financial Reviews on pages 50 to 54.
The Group has significant financial resources and the Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group, including the repayment of 1.7billion to shareholders by 2021, and compared this to the level of committed loan facilities and cash resources over the medium term.
In making this assessment consideration has been given to the uncertainty inherent in future financial forecasts and where applicable reasonable sensitivities have been applied to the key factors affecting the financial performance of the Group.
Based on the financial performance of the Group, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the foreseeable future, notwithstanding its net current liability position of 610.8m 30 April 2014: 616.0m.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Pensions Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Share-based payments The Company operates three equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Dividends Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payout and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
