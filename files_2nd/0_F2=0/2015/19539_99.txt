14 Equity This note analyses the movements recorded through shareholders equity that are not explained elsewhere in the financial statements, being changes in the amount which shareholders have invested in the Group.
The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration package.
Share option schemes for our employees include The Sage Group Performance Share Plan for directors and senior executives and The Sage Group Savings-related Share Option Plan the SAYE Plan for all qualifying employees.
We incur a cost in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
This note also shows the dividends paid in the year and any dividends that are to be proposed and paid post year-end.
Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.
Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled or reissued.

77 14.2 Share-based payments Accounting policy Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest allowing for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes or the Monte Carlo pricing models, based on observable market prices.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
All outstanding Sage Performance Share Plans PSPs and certain Restricted Share Plans RSPs are subject to some non-market performance conditions.
These are organic revenue and EPS growth.
The element of the income statement charge relating to market performance conditions is fixed at the grant date.
At the end of the reporting period, the Group revises its estimates for the number of options expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plan was 9.1m 2014: 8.0m, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
This charge is shown by scheme below.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 8.9m 2014: 7.8m.

There have been no grants of executive share options under the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS since June 2008.
Long-term incentive awards are made under The Sage Group plc Performance Share Plan.
The performance targets governing the vesting of options were based on stretching EPS growth measured over a fixed three-year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options vested at the end of the period where the increase in EPS exceeded the Retail Prices Index RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options vested at that time where RPI was exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options vested on a straight-line basis.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The expected volatility was based on historical volatility over the previous four years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return was the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life of three years.

The Sage Group Performance Share Plan Annual grants of performance shares will normally be made to executive directors and senior executives across the Group after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
Under the Performance Share Plan 5,411,495 2014: 5,519,987 awards were made during the year.
Awards prior to 2013 Annual awards under the Plan were limited to shares worth up to 300% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors were limited to shares with a maximum value on award of 210% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance shares were subject to performance conditions on a sliding scale based on EPS.
25% of the award vested at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeded RPI by 9% an average of 3% per year : 100% of the award vested at that time only where RPI was exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, awards vested on a straight-line basis, and if those targets were not met there was no opportunity for re-testing.
Awards were then subject to a total shareholder return TSR multiplier whereby the level of vesting based on EPS achievement was adjusted according to TSR performance over the same three-year period compared with a group of international software and computer services companies.
The comparator group for awards made in 2012 comprised the following companies: Adobe Systems Cegid Logica Salesforce.
com ARM Holdings Dassault Systmes Micro Focus International SAP Blackbaud Exact Microsoft Software AG Cap Gemini Intuit Oracle If Sages TSR was ranked at lower quartile in the group, the multiplier was 0.75.
If Sages TSR was ranked at median in the group, the multiplier was 1.
If Sages TSR was ranked at upper quartile in the group, then the multiplier was 1.5.
Straight-line pro-rating applied between 0.75 and 1, and between 1 and 1.5, but the multiplier could not be higher or lower than these figures.
146 The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Awards from 2013 onwards These performance shares are subject to a service condition and three performance conditions.
Performance conditions are weighted one third on the achievement of an EPS target, and one third on the achievement of an organic revenue growth target.
The remaining one third is based on a TSR target.
The EPS vesting percentage is based on compound EPS growth.
Where compound EPS growth is between 6% and 12%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where compound EPS growth is between 12% and 15%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The organic revenue growth target is based on the Companys compound annual organic revenue growth.
Where growth is between 4% and 8% the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where the Companys compound organic revenue growth is between 8% and 10%, the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
In order for the organic revenue growth target proportion to vest, the underlying operating profit margin in the financial year of vesting must not be less than that of the underlying operating profit margin for the financial year in which the award is granted.
The final third of the award is the performance target relating to TSR which measures share price performance against a designated comparator group.
Where the Companys TSR is between median and upper quartile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7% and where the Companys TSR is between upper quartile and upper decile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The TSR vesting percentage may only exceed 26.7% Stretch level if performance against either the EPS target or the organic revenue growth target is also at Stretch level.
The comparator group for awards granted from 2013 onwards is the companies comprised in the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period, excluding financial services and extraction companies.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations, which were based on observable market prices at grant date.
All options granted under performance share awards have an exercise price of nil.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed award life.

Executive directors are not permitted to participate in the plan and shares are purchased in the market to satisfy vesting awards.
These awards only have service conditions and their fair values are equal to the share price on the date of grant, ranging from 465 527p.
The plan options granted in December 2013 have vested at 67.5% of the total award, based upon FY15 organic revenue growth.
These options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last two or three years, consistent with the award life.
