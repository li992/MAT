All pension benefits since that time are provided byway of a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2012 and updated to 31 December 2015 by a qualified actuary.
The Group is committed to a funding deficit recovery plan entered into following the 2012 valuation.
The triennial valuation of the scheme has been performed during 2015.
The company and trustees are in the process of agreeing a new deficit recovery plan.
The scheme is exposed to a number of risks the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: ifplan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset byan increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases inlife expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members widow and orphan benefits is reinsured by an external insurance company.
