These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
Shareholders are therefore advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
Please note that it is very unlikely that either the Company or the Companys Registrar, Computershare Investor Services 3 & ZRXOG PDNH XQVROLFLWHG WHOHSKRQH FDOOV WR VKDUHKROGHUV DQG WKDW DQ VXFK FDOOV ZRXOG UHODWH RQO WR RIILFLDO documentation already circulated to shareholders and never in respect of investment advice.
