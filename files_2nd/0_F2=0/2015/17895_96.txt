Financial risk management Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate uctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of xed rate debt relative to oating rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps.
The Groups interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2014 50% and a maximum of 90% 2014 90% of gross debt is maintained at xed interest rates.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had 83% 2014 81% of xed rate debt and 17% 2014 19% of oating ratedebt based on a gross debt of 4.0bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets 2014 3.3bn.
Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Less than Between one More than one year and two years two years m m m Cash and cash equivalents 2,537 Loans and overdrafts 681 681 681 The oating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the xed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either oating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2015, the Group had a total of $1.0bn 2014 $1.0bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 3.6 years 2014 4.6 years.
In respect of the xed rate debt, the weighted average period in respect of which interest is xed was 11.5 years 2014 10.1 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the oating rate debt was 3.5% 2014 4.1% on US dollars.
Thecost of the xed rate debt was 4.9% 2014 5.4%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average xed oating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost tothe Group by 7m 2014 6m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the uctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at oating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 7m 2014 9m.

Financial risk management continued Borrowing facilities The Groups objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 2bn 2014 2bn.
The RCF is contracted until2018 at 2bn and from 2018 to 2020 at 1.9bn.
The RCF was undrawn throughout the year.
The RCF also acts as a back stop to Commercial Paper issued by the Group.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had no Commercial Paper in issue 2014 nil.
Cash management Cash ow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by cash forecasts.
The Groups objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of its surplus cash.
It is deposited with financial institutions with the strongest credit ratings for short periods.
The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2015 of 2,537m 2014 2,308m was invested with 35 2014 30 financial institutions.
A credit limit is allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such as short-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process.
Currency risk The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and cash ows from movements in foreign currency exchangerates, mainly the US dollar, Euro, Saudi Riyal and Australian dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
All material rmtransactional exposures are hedged and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statements or balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
Credit risk The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables, a provision for bad debts has been calculated taking into account individual assessments based on past credit history and prior knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk, and no one counterparty constitutes more than 12% of the balance 2014 7%.
The ageing of trade receivables is detailed below: 2015 2014 Gross Provision Net Gross Provision Net m m m m m m Not past due and not impaired 807 807 611 611 Up to 180 days overdue and not impaired 376 376 266 266 Past 180 days overdue and not impaired 101 101 58 58 Past 180 days overdue and impaired 25 25 28 28 1,309 25 1,284 963 28 935 Movements on the provision for bad debts are as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 1 January 28 27 Created 8 15 Utilised 3 4 Released 9 11 Foreign exchange adjustments 1 1 At 31 December 25 28 BAE Systems Annual Report 2015 |
