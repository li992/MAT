Unsecured bank borrowings due after one year represent amounts drawn down under the Groups revolving credit facilities, net of unamortised issue costs expected to be charged to the income statement after 12 months from the balance sheet date.

Other borrowings represent amounts drawn down under the securitisations liquidity facility.
During the prior period the facilitys provider, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, had its short-term credit rating downgraded below the minimum prescribed in the facility agreement and as such the Group exercised its entitlement to draw the full amount of the facility and hold it in a designated bank account.
The corresponding balance of 120.0 million 2014: 120.0 million held in this bank account is included within cash and cash equivalents.
The amounts drawn down can only be used for the purpose of meeting the securitisations debt service obligations should there ever be insufficient funds available from operations to meet such payments.
As such these amounts are considered to be restricted cash.
Included within cash and cash equivalents is an amount of 1.6 million 2014: 1.4 million relating to a letter of credit with Royal Sun Alliance Insurance, an amount of 1.0 million 2014: 1.0 million relating to a letter of credit with Aviva, and an amount of 7.8 million 2014: 8.2 million relating to collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
These amounts are also considered to be restricted cash.
In addition, any other cash held in connection with the securitised business is governed by certain restrictions under the covenants associated with the securitisation note 19.
