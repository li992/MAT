Financial statements SECTION 2 OIL AND GAS ASSETS, DECOMMISSIONING PROVISIONS AND RELATED GOODWILL This section focuses on the assets in the Balance Sheet which form the core of Cairns business.
This section quantifies the financial impact of the operations for the year fully described in the Operational review on pages 26 to 31.
Included are details of the appraisal and exploration wells in Senegal, the farm-down of Catcher and the impairment reviews and tests performed on the Groups assets.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS IN THIS SECTION: IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF OIL AND GAS ASSETS With the continued decline in the oil price over the year, Cairn has tested its oil and gas assets for impairment.
The impairment tests resulted in impairment charges of US$43.0m against UK North Sea exploration and development assets.
For details of the indicators and the subsequent impairment tests conducted on those assets, see Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS SECTION: IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF INTANGIBLE EXPLORATION APPRAISAL ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENT ASSETS Where an indicator of impairment is identified on an intangible exploration appraisal asset or a development asset, an impairment test is conducted in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The test compares either the carrying value of the asset or the carrying value of the cash-generating unit CGU containing the asset, to the recoverable amount of that asset or CGU.
The recoverable amount of an asset represents its fair value less costs of disposal.
This is based on either a verifiable third-party arms-length transaction from which a fair value can be obtained or where there is no such transaction, the fair value less costs of disposal of an asset is calculated using discounted post-tax cash flow models over the field life of the asset.
The key assumptions used in the Groups discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of external factors.
These assumptions include: Short medium-term oil price based on a three-month average forward curve for three years from the Balance Sheet date: Long-term oil price of US$80 per boe 2014: US$90 per boe escalated at 2.0% 2014: 2.5% per annum: Reserve estimates of discovered resource 2P and 2C based on P50 reserve estimates: Production profiles based on Cairns internal estimates which are not materially different from those of the operators: Cost profiles for the development of the field and subsequent operating costs supplied by the operator and escalated at 2.0% 2014: 2.0% per annum: and Post-tax discount rates of 10% 2014: 10% for the Groups UK and Norwegian North Sea assets.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL The goodwill arising from past corporate transactions in the UK and Norwegian North Sea is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the underlying oil and gas assets in the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment.
As with the assets above, fair value less costs of disposal are based on discounted post-tax cash flow models where no recent third-party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established.
The key assumptions are therefore consistent with those for testing intangible exploration appraisal assets.
Where resource is prospective, fair value represents the expected net present value of the prospect, risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Given the inherent risk associated with exploration activities, valuations of prospective resource are highly subjective.
DECOMMISSIONING ESTIMATES Provisions for decommissioning are based on the latest estimates provided by operators, subject to review by Cairn and adjustment where deemed necessary.
Costs provided to date are an estimate of the cost that would be incurred to remove and decommission facilities that existed at the year end and to plug and abandon development wells drilled to that date.
Costs are escalated at 2.0% per annum and discounted at a risk-free rate of 2.0%.
118 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 2.1 INTANGIBLE EXPLORATION APPRAISAL ASSETS ACCOUNTING POLICY Cairn follows a  accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area, pre-award costs, are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment development producing assets, after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
Proceeds from the disposal of part or all of an exploration asset should be credited initially to that interest with any excess being credited to the Income Statement.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
An indicator that one of the Groups assets may be impaired is most likely to be one of the following: There are no further plans to conduct exploration activities in the area: Exploration drilling in the area has failed to discover commercial reserve volumes: Changes in the oil price or other market conditions indicate that discoveries may no longer be commercial: or Development proposals for appraisal assets in the pre-development stage indicate that it is unlikely that the carrying value of the exploration appraisal asset will be recovered in full.
In such circumstances the intangible exploration appraisal asset is allocated to any property, plant & equipment development producing assets within the same cash generating unit and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development producing assets within the cash-generating unit, the excess of the carrying amount of exploration appraisal asset over its recoverable amount are charged immediately to the Income Statement.

The SNE-2 and SNE-3 appraisal wells completed in Q1 2016.
The third well, the BEL-1 well, with exploration and appraisal targets, is ongoing.
Subsequent exploration and appraisal wells are subject to joint operator approval.
Further appraisal is required to determine the commerciality of the FAN-1 discovery and costs to date remain capitalised.
Capitalised costs of US$228.2m at 31 December 2015 include the cost of the 2014 SNE-1 and FAN-1 wells and 2015 year-to-date costs of the current drilling programme.
Disposals of US$20.5m in 2014 represent back costs received following the farm-down to ConocoPhillips, completed in January 2014.
Atlantic Margin Other Africa The Cap Boujdour well, offshore Morocco, completed in March 2015, failing to encounter commercial hydrocarbon volumes.
Costs incurred in the current year on this well and other close-out costs on the Foum Draa and Juby Maritime relinquished licences of US$56.2m 2014: US$100.1m were charged to the Income Statement.
Costs of US$31.1m remaining in exploration appraisal at the year end represent costs to date in Mauritania.
Atlantic Margin Greenland and Republic of Ireland The costs of US$24.9m remaining at the year end primarily relate to the Spanish Point appraisal prospect, offshore Republic of Ireland.
Cairn retains one licence in Greenland, containing the Pitu prospect.
Cairn is looking to farm-down its interest before committing to further exploration work and at the year end all costs associated with this licence have been impaired.
All other licences in Greenland have been or are currently in the process of relinquishment and all previously capitalised costs have been written off.
North West Europe UK and Norway UK and Norwegian North Sea Additions in the current year of US$32.3m 2014: US$108.8m relate to expenditure on exploration and appraisal wells drilled and ongoing licence costs.
Two wells were drilled during 2015, the successful Kraken West appraisal well in the UK North Sea and the unsuccessful Crossbill exploration well in the Norwegian North Sea.
Disposal proceeds of US$11.6m relate to the sale of a 10% working interest in the Catcher asset refer to Section 2.3 for further details.
Unsuccessful exploration costs charged to the Income Statement in the year were US$44.2m.
Costs of the Crossbill exploration well were US$12.7m.
A further US$23.7m related to the Bonneville satellite discovery in the Greater Catcher area, which, due to changes in UK tax legislation specific to oil and gas companies and the reduced oil price, is no longer commercial and will be relinquished.
Finally, costs of US$7.8m were expensed on licences where no further exploration activity is planned.
During 2014, two exploration wells were completed in the North Sea.
Neither the UK Aragon well nor the Norwegian Atlas well discovered hydrocarbons.
Unsuccessful exploration costs of US$50.0m were charged to the Income Statement together with US$2.2m relating to other licences.
Costs of US$25.2m were also charged to the 2014 Income Statement in respect of Skarfjell appraisal drilling.
The appraisal wells confirmed the estimated reserve volumes of the discovery without materially increasing the future economic value of the field and it was considered unlikely that the costs relating to the wells would be recovered in full.
DECC approval of the Catcher FDP was received in June 2014.
Costs of US$148.4m were transferred from Intangible exploration appraisal assets to Property, plant & equipment development producing assets during the prior year.
At the year end, Cairn reviewed its intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment.
Indicators were identified where the fall in the oil price may impact the future commerciality of exploration and appraisal assets.
Impairment tests identified impairment on the Groups intangible exploration assets, resulting in a charge of US$16.7m to the Income Statement 2014: US$24.2m.
The charge relates to the impairment of satellite fields within the Catcher development area.
Exploration costs remaining at the year end include the net book value of the Catcher exploration prospects, Laverda and Sunbeam, the Skarfjell discovery and associated satellite prospects and the Kraken West exploration costs.
Norwegian Barents Sea In 2014, Cairn farmed-in to Block PL393B in the Barents Sea.
Farm-in and other costs and the unsuccessful Ensis exploration well costs of US$17.4m were charged to the Income Statement in the prior year.
No costs remain capitalised at the year end.
120 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 2.2 PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENT PRODUCING ASSETS ACCOUNTING POLICY Costs All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development producing assets on a field-by-field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Costs of borrowings relating to the ongoing construction of development assets and facilities are capitalised during the development phase of the project.
Capitalisation ceases once the asset is ready to commence production.
Net proceeds from any disposal or part disposal of development producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Impairment Development producing assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at the Balance Sheet date.
Indicators of impairment for the Groups development producing assets include: Downward revisions of reserve estimates: Increases in cost estimates for development projects: or A decrease in the oil price or other negative changes in market conditions.
Impairment tests are carried out on each development producing asset at the Balance Sheet date where an indicator of impairment is identified.
The test compares the carrying value of an asset to its recoverable amount based on the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
Where the fair value less costs of disposal supports the carrying value of the asset, no value-in-use calculation is performed.
If it is not possible to calculate the fair value less costs of disposal of an individual asset, the fair value less costs of disposal is calculated for the cash-generating unit containing the asset and tested against the carrying value of the assets and liabilities in the cash-generating unit for impairment.
Where an asset can be tested independently for impairment, this test is performed prior to the inclusion of the asset into a cash-generating unit for further impairment tests.
If the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge is made.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the recoverable amount is higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.

Further additions include US$32.3m for the decommissioning asset recognised, US$127.7m of expenditure on the Kraken development project and other sole costs incurred.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 121 Financial statements SECTION 2 OIL AND GAS ASSETS, DECOMMISSIONING PROVISIONS AND RELATED GOODWILL CONTINUED 2.2 PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENT PRODUCING ASSETS CONTINUED In 2014 exploration and appraisal costs of US$148.4m relating to the Catcher fields included in the FDP were transferred to development producing assets.
Impairment tests were performed on the Groups development producing assets at the Balance Sheet date, resulting in an impairment charge of US$25.1m being recorded against the Catcher development asset.
The impairment results from continuing low oil price environment, leading to a reduction in the Groups short term oil price assumption and a downward revision to the Groups long term assumption.
Sensitivity analysis is provided in Section 2.7.
2.3 GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF OIL AND GAS ASSETS In January 2015, Cairn completed the farm-down of 10% of the Groups working interest in the Catcher development, satellite fields and surrounding exploration acreage to Dyas.
Under the terms of the deal, Dyas will fund Cairns exploration and development costs in respect of the licences up to a cap of US$182.0m, from an effective economic date of 1 January 2014.
On completion of the transaction, Cairn received cash proceeds of US$54.7m US$36.5m under the carry, US$18.2m as a refund of the 10% share of costs from 1 January 2014 and recognised the remaining carry as a receivable at its discounted, post-tax fair value of US$44.7m.
US$11.6m of the proceeds received were allocated to exploration assets and credited against previously capitalised exploration costs.
The remaining proceeds and carry receivable were allocated to development assets.
The disposal of 10% of the Groups working interest in the development asset with related working capital adjustments resulted in a gain on disposal of US$26.6m and a tax credit of US$4.6m.
2.4 PROVISIONS DECOMMISSIONING ACCOUNTING POLICY At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in plugging and abandoning wells, removing sub-sea installations and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant & equipment development producing assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the Depletion and decommissioning charge in the Income Statement, and the unwinding of discount of the provision is included within Finance costs.

Provisions represent the obligation arising based on work undertaken at the balance sheet date.
In the prior year exploration well abandonment costs as at 31 December 2014 of US$3.6m were included within provisions included in current liabilities.
The planned work has since been deferred beyond the end of 2016.
The decommissioning of the Groups development assets is forecast to occur between 2030 and 2039.

These commitments include Cairns share of the capital commitments of the joint operations themselves.
The capital commitments for Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets primarily relate to operations in Senegal and the UK and Norwegian North Sea.
The Capital commitments for Property, Plant & Equipment Development Producing Assets include US$572.7m relating to two lease commitments due within the next eight years.
The lease terms for these assets have not yet commenced.
The Group has no further material capital expenditure committed at the Balance Sheet date.
2.6 INTANGIBLE ASSETS GOODWILL ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill Cairn allocates the purchase consideration on the acquisition of a subsidiary to the assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the underlying cash-generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future years.
In testing for impairment, goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated from the date of acquisition to the group of cash-generating units representing the lowest level at which it will be monitored.
Cairns policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level before combining segments for reporting.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit, or group of cash-generating units, within the segment is based on its fair value less costs of disposal, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factor which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the result of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 123 Financial statements SECTION 2 OIL AND GAS ASSETS, DECOMMISSIONING PROVISIONS AND RELATED GOODWILL CONTINUED 2.7 IMPAIRMENT TESTING SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS NORTH WEST EUROPE OIL AND GAS ASSETS At 31 December 2015, impairment tests were conducted on the Groups North Sea exploration appraisal assets and development producing assets resulting in an impairment charge of US$25.1m.
An impairment test was also conducted on goodwill allocated to the North Sea operating segment though no further impairment was identified.
The recoverable amount for all assets is based on fair value less costs of disposal estimated using discounted cash flow modelling.
The key assumptions used in determining the fair value are often subjective, such as the future oil price assumption, or reliant upon the performance of operational partners for delivering development projects on time and within approved budgets.
Cairn has run sensitivities on its long-term oil price assumption of US$80, using alternate prices ranging from US$75 to US$60, and on the impact of a six month delay to the Groups development projects over the current first oil dates included in the impairment test models.
A six month delay to either project has no material impact on the impairment test at the current long term oil price assumption.
The impact of these changes on the carrying value of the Groups assets at the Balance Sheet date is summarised below: Decrease in long term oil price assumption to: US$75 US$70 US$65 US$60 US$m US$m US$m US$m Decrease in Property, plant & equipment development assets No delay to first oil production from either Catcher or Kraken 62.6 151.3 240.8 307.9 Delay of six months to Kraken: Catcher on schedule 62.4 151.2 246.7 321.1 Delay of six months to Catcher: Kraken on schedule 72.9 167.4 263.3 356.3 Delay of six month delay to both Catcher and Kraken 72.7 167.3 269.2 369.5 Decrease in Goodwill No delay to first oil production from either Catcher or Kraken 48.9 Delay of six months to Kraken: Catcher on schedule 46.4 Delay of six months to Catcher: Kraken on schedule 24.5 Delay of six month delay to both Catcher and Kraken 22.1 The Groups proved and probable and contingent reserve estimates are based on P50 probabilities.
P10 and P90 estimates are also produced but would not provide a reasonable estimate to be used in calculating the fair value of the Groups assets.
Cairns reserve estimates do not materially differ from those of the operators.
OTHER OIL AND GAS ASSETS At the year end, an impairment charge was recognised on certain intangible exploration assets in Greenland as noted in Section 2.1.
These assets are fully impaired in accordance with IFRS and the Groups accounting policies and therefore there is no meaningful sensitivity analysis to provide.
There are no reasonable changes in assumptions that would lead to a material impairment of any of the Groups remaining assets in the Atlantic Margin.
124 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information SECTION 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL Cairns liquid cash resources supported by the undrawn secured borrowing facility ensure the Group is fully funded to meet its current exploration and development programme despite the current restriction on the sale of shares in Cairn India Limited.
This section focuses on those assets, together with the working capital position of the Group at the year end.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS IN THIS SECTION: IMPAIRMENT OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSET The Groups 10% shareholding in Cairn India Limited, classified as a non-current available-for-sale financial asset, suffered a significant fall in value during 2015.
The size of the deficit was such that the mark-to-market valuation deficit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and classified as an available-for-sale reserve in equity, were recycled to the Income Statement as impairment.
The closing book value of the asset represents the quoted market price of the Groups residual holding.
Although Cairn is currently not able to sell its 9.8% stake, there is no restriction in the wider market where Cairn India Limited shares trade freely at this price.
KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS SECTION: There were no key estimations or assumptions in this section.
3.1 AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS ACCOUNTING POLICY The Groups available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares which are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cumulative gains or losses that arise on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale assets are recycled through the Income Statement.
At each reporting date, the fair value of the financial asset is compared to the value at the date of its initial recognition for signs of a prolonged or significant deficit in the valuation, which would indicate impairment.
Where impairment is identified, cumulative losses recognised in Other comprehensive income are recycled to the Income Statement.
In the event of a subsequent recovery in the valuation of the asset, there is no reversal of impairment: any such post-impairment gains are recognised as a surplus through Other comprehensive income.
Any further impairment losses will be recognised through the Income Statement.

These listed equity securities present the Group with an opportunity for return through dividend income or trading gains.
At 31 December 2015, the value of the investment in Cairn India Limited had fallen to US$384.0m.
The significant accumulated deficit during 2015 of US$318.6m 2014: US$194.3m the cumulative deficit from 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2014 was recycled to the Income Statement and recorded as impairment.
Cairn is currently restricted from selling its shares in Cairn India Limited.
In January 2014, the Company disposed of 12,048,836 shares in Cairn India Limited, a 0.6% interest, prior to the restriction being enforced.
The Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from the listed equity investments it holds in Cairn India Limited.
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets is recycled through the Income Statement.

Fair value The Group holds listed equity shares as a non-current available-for-sale financial asset.
The Group determines and discloses the fair value of these by reference to the quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for those shares at the measurement date.
At 31 December 2015 the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2015 2014 Assets measured at fair value Level 1 US$m US$m Available-for-sale financial assets Equity shares listed 384.0 702.6 384.0 702.6 128 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 3.6 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board of Cairn Energy PLC through the Treasury Sub-Committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
The Group is also exposed to market risk arising from equity price fluctuations on available-for-sale financial assets see Section 3.1 for details.
The Groups treasury function and Executive Team as appropriate are responsible for managing these risks, in accordance with the policies set by the Board.
Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, investment and funding requirements using a variety of techniques.
These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group have adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
There are no significant concentrations of risks unless otherwise stated.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
The primary financial assets and liabilities comprise cash, short and medium-term deposits, notice accounts, certificates of deposit, money market liquidity funds, listed equity shares Cairn India Limited only, intra-group loans and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives such as equity issues and other forms of non-investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk using both short and long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by debt and equity financing plans and active portfolio management.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in and delays of development projects.
The Groups forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
Details of the Groups debt facilities can be found in Section 3.2.
The Group is subject to quarterly forecast liquidity tests as part of the debt facility agreement.
The group has complied with the capital requirements of this test at all times during the year.
The Group runs various sensitivities on its liquidity position on a quarterly basis throughout the year.
Further details are noted in the viability statement provided on page 43.
The Group currently has surplus cash that is invested in a combination of money market liquidity funds, notice accounts and term deposits with a number of international and UK financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short and medium-term expenditure requirements.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, investments with banks and financial institutions and joint operations.
Joint operation partners are subject to a risk assessment using publicly available information and credit reference agencies, with follow-up due diligence and monitoring if required.
Investment credit risk for investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Group Treasury function in accordance with the Board-approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC.
These policies limit counterparty exposure and maturity and take account of published ratings, market measures and other market information.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate the risk of financial loss through counterparty failure.
It is Cairns policy to invest with banks or other financial institutions that firstly offer the greatest degree of security in the view of the Group, and, secondly the most competitive interest rates.
Repayment of principal is the overriding priority and this is achieved by diversification and shorter maturities to provide flexibility.
The Board continually re-assesses the Groups policy and updates as required.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had investments with 24 counterparties 2014: 22 to ensure no concentration of counterparty investment risk.
The maturity of these investments ranged from instant access to three months.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 129 Financial statements SECTION 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL CONTINUED 3.6 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts and payments have mostly been in US dollars and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US dollars.
The Group also aims where possible to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in functional currency that in most cases is US dollars, thereby matching the reporting currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group.
This minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant the Company and Group may from time to time opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to movements in the US$:GBP exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups monetary assets and liabilities.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

This section also includes details of employee benefits paid in the year and finance income and costs.
4.1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS OPERATING SEGMENTS Cairn holds a balanced portfolio of exploration and development assets focused in three geographical regions: North West Europe: the Atlantic Margin: and the Mediterranean.
The operations of the Group are organised on a country-by-country basis: countries form the Groups operating segments.
For management reporting purposes, operating segments are combined into regional business units.
Cairn monitors the results of each regional unit separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
The Groups Atlantic Margin exploration region contains two units.
Assets in Greenland and the Republic of Ireland are combined into one unit while the Groups African operating segments in Senegal, Morocco and Mauritania also form a separate unit.
There were no profit or loss items incurred during the year for Senegal or Mauritania.
The North West Europe regional unit holds the UK and Norway operating segments.
Currently the segment contains the Groups North Sea assets including the Skarfjell discovery in Norway and the UK Catcher and Kraken developments.
The results of the Mediterranean region are reported along with the Groups corporate assets within Other Cairn Energy Group.
Subsequent to the year end, the Group reorganised its Atlantic Margin and Mediterranean business units into two new units: Senegal and International.
This change is not reflected in the analysis provided in these financial statements.
GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: NON-CURRENT ASSETS Non-current assets for this purpose consist of intangible exploration appraisal assets: property, plant & equipment development producing assets: intangible assets goodwill: and other property, plant & equipment and intangible assets.

The primary inputs to the model are consistent with those of the other share award schemes, though vesting percentages for LTIPs can be above 100%.
For details on the vesting conditions attached to the LTIPs refer to the Directors Remuneration report on pages 81 to 104.
The other Cairn Energy PLC share awards during 2015 were valued using a Monte Carlo model with the exception of the SIP awards which were valued using a Black-Scholes model.
Awards in prior years were valued similarly.
Cairn Energy PLC share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year, subject to the normal employee dealing bans imposed at certain times by the Company.
The weighted average share price during the year was 1.653 2014: 1.877.
The main inputs to the models include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are based on the length of time after the vesting periods for awards in 2015, further details are below.
The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 81 to 104, over a 10-year period to the date of award.
The following assumptions and inputs apply: Lapse due to Risk-free rate withdrawals Scheme name Volatility per annum per annum 2010 Share Incentive Plan 29% 52% 0% 1.91% 5% 2009 Approved and Unapproved Plans 29% 52% 0.29% 2.71% 5% 2009 LTIP 29% 52% 0% 2.33% 2015 Employee Share Awards 5% Employee exercise trigger point assumptions For 2015 awards, the assumption used for the 2009 Approved and Unapproved awards is that employees will exercise half of the awards on the vesting date and the remaining half will be exercised equally each year over the following seven years.
This assumption is modified for the 2009 LTIP awards such that awards are assumed to be exercised 10% on the three-year anniversary of the award date and 22.5% each year thereafter up until the seventh anniversary date.
The assumption used for the valuation of the SIP is that employees will withdraw shares five years after the award date.

Analysis is provided of the Groups Income Statement charges and credits and deferred tax movements through the Balance Sheet.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS IN THIS SECTION: DEFERRED TAXATION In prior years, Cairn recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of UK North Sea oil and gas assets.
This deductible temporary difference represented eligible field allowances on the Kraken and Catcher assets and tax losses available to offset future taxable profits from those assets offset by other taxable temporary differences.
At each reporting date, Cairn reviews the carrying value of deferred tax assets to assess whether it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise unused tax losses and allowances which give rise to the asset.
Given the low oil price, Cairn no longer believes that it is probable that UK North Sea assets will generate the taxable profits necessary to allow the temporary differences reflected in the deferred tax asset to be utilised in full.
The Groups deferred tax asset remaining at 31 December 2015 of US$22.2m has therefore been reversed.
CONTINGENT LIABILITY INDIAN TAX Cairn has been resolutely defending the Groups tax position in India following the tax issue raised and subsequent demand notice issued by the Indian Taxation department.
Cairn has filed a notice of dispute with the Indian Government and international arbitration proceedings have commenced.
Based on the strengths of Cairns legal arguments, no provision is made in the financial statements for any claim made by the Indian Tax Department.
KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS SECTION: There were no key estimates or assumption in this section.
ACCOUNTING POLICY The total tax charge or credit represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax credit is based on the taxable loss for the year.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
In Norway, tax refunds may be claimed on exploration activities and related overhead costs: the tax refundable is included as a tax credit in the period in which the qualifying expenditure is incurred.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences that exist only where it is probable that taxable profits will be generated against which the carrying value of the deferred tax asset can be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint operations where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset or liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
5.1 TAX STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE The Groups tax strategy is fully aligned with its overarching business objectives and principles.
Cairn commits to managing its tax affairs in a transparent and responsible manner and ensuring that all statutory obligations and disclosure requirements are met.
Cairns aim is to comply with both the letter and spirit of the law in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate, to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid, at the right time, within the right jurisdiction.
As the Groups UK activities are focused on assets in development, with no saleable production at present, there are currently no taxable profits in the UK.
Taxable profits in other jurisdictions, where Cairns assets are in the early stages of the value creation cycle, are also minimal and as a result there were no cash payments of corporation taxes made during the year 2014: nil.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 139 Financial statements SECTION 5 TAXATION CONTINUED 5.1 TAX STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE CONTINUED Cairns policy is to not enter into any artificial tax avoidance schemes and to build and maintain strong collaborative working relationships with all relevant tax authorities, based on honesty, integrity and proactive cooperation.
The Group aims for certainty in relation to the tax treatment of all items: however, it is acknowledged that this will not always be possible, for example where transactions are complex or there is a lack of maturity in the tax regime in the relevant jurisdiction in which the Group are operating.
In such circumstances Cairn will seek external advice where appropriate and ensure that the approach adopted in any relevant tax return is supportable and includes full disclosure of the position taken.

Deferred tax liabilities on the Groups available-for-sale financial asset fully reversed in the year as the valuation of the Groups residual interest in Cairn India Limited declined.
As the deficit on the valuation of the financial asset was recycled to the Income Statement as impairment, the US$9.5m US$40.9m of deferred tax credits relating to the deficit were also recycled.

The UK main rate of corporation tax was 21% prior to 1 April 2015, and 20% from that date onwards.
The reduction in the tax rate from 21% to 20% has resulted in an average rate of corporation tax of 20.25% for the year ended 31 December 2015, as shown above.
The applicable UK statutory tax rate applying to North Sea oil and gas activities is 50%.
The applicable rate applying to the prior year was 62%.
The reduction in rate was effective from 1 January 2015.
The applicable Norwegian rate applying to oil and gas activities is 78%.

5.5 CONTINGENT LIABILITY INDIAN TAX ASSESSMENT Cairn UK Holdings Limited CUHL, a direct subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC, is in receipt of an assessment order from the Indian Income Tax Department IITD relating to the intra-group restructuring undertaken in 2006 prior to the IPO of CIL in India, which cites a retrospective amendment to Indian tax law introduced in 2012.
Cairn strongly contests the basis of this attempt to retrospectively tax the group for an internal restructuring.
The assessment order is in the amount of INR 102 billion approximately US$1.6bn plus interest back dated to 2007 totalling INR 188bn approximately US$2.8bn.
The total assets of CUHL have a current value of US$477.5m comprising principally the groups 9.8% shareholding in CIL and any recovery by the Indian authorities would be limited to such assets.
CUHL is pursuing its rights under Indian law to appeal the assessment, both in respect of the basis of taxation and the quantum assessed.
CUHLs 9.8% shareholding in CIL was originally attached by the IITD in January 2014 and CUHL continues to be restricted by the IITD from selling such shares.
Furthermore, Cairn has also commenced international arbitration proceedings against the Republic of India under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty the Treaty, on the basis that Indias actions have breached the Treaty by 1 expropriating Cairns property without adequate and just compensation, 2 denying fair and equitable treatment to Cairn in respect of its investments and 3 restricting Cairns right to freely transfer funds in connection with its investment.
Based on detailed legal advice, Cairn is confident that it will be successful in such arbitration.
Cairns claim will seek relief by way of indemnification in respect of the tax demand, plus full compensation for its losses including the loss of the value in the CIL shares.
