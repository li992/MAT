50 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements of the Company and subsidiary have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union.
a Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice the SORP for investment trusts issued by the AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with recommendations of the SORP.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the basis that approval as an investment trust company will continue to be met.
The Directors have made an assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, having taken into account the liquidity of the Companys investment portfolio and the Companys financial position in respect of its cash flows, borrowing facilities and investment commitments of which there are none of significance.
Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
IFRS 10 sets out the principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements and establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities.
In addition, IFRS 10 includes an exception from consolidation for entities which meet the definition of an investment entity, and requires such entities to recognise substantially all investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Company has made the significant accounting judgement that it does meet the criteria of an investment entity, as discussed in note 1 q.
Accordingly the Company is no longer required to prepare consolidated financial statements and so has prepared individual company accounts, with only individual company comparatives as required by IAS 1.
IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
The requirements in IFRS 12 are more comprehensive than the previously existing disclosure requirements.
The standard did not have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Company.
The Company's one subsidiary, BEST Securities Limited, has not been consolidated.
For further information please see note 9.
The functional currency of the Company is Pounds Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The financial statements are also presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
b Accounting developments The accounting policies adopted are consistent with the previous financial year, except that the following new standards have been adopted in the current year.
IFRS 10 and IFRS 12 as discussed in note 1 a Basis of preparation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts in the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future period if the revision affects both current and future periods.
There were no accounting estimates or significant judgements in the current period.
51 British Empire Trust plc Company Summary IFC Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report 02 17 Investment Review 18 31 Governance 32 45 Financial Statements 46 76 Shareholder Information 77 82 c Presentation of Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Company is registered as an investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006.
Additionally, net revenue is the measure which the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. d Changes to accounting principles The Company has applied, for the first time, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Under IFRS 10 the subsidiary has been classified as an investment entity.
As a result it is no longer consolidated and is instead held at fair value.
Impact on Statement of Comprehensive Income As a result of this change in treatment, the total return generated by the subsidiary is no longer presented on a line-by-line basis but combined and shown within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
This has resulted in the prior year figures shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income being presented for the Company, where previously consolidated figures were shown.
The impact of this change on the prior year figures by line item is: unrealised gains on investments held at fair value reduced by 1,762,000: and investment income increased by 1,762,000.
No other prior year figures for the primary financial statements have been affected.
e Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss and are described in the financial statements as investments held at fair value.
All investments are designated as held at fair value upon initial recognition and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
If a significant movement in fair value occurs subsequent to the close of trading up to midnight on the traded Stock Exchange on the year end date, valuation techniques will be applied to determine the fair value.
A significant event is any event that occurs after the last market price for a security, close of market or close of the foreign exchange, but before the Companys valuation time that materially affects the integrity of the closing prices for any security, instrument, currency or securities affected by that event so that they cannot be considered readily available market.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or investments for which the market is inactive, are established by using various valuation techniques in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation the IPEV guidelines.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost subject to any provision for impairment.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within gain on investment at fair value through profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses for fair value through profit or loss on investments are included within the changes in their fair value.
52 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued f Movements in fair value of investment Changes in fair value of investments are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a capital item.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as capital items.
All investments held are classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given.
After initial recognition, investments are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses on investments and impairment of investments recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and allocated to capital.
All investments for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy in note 17, described as follows, based on the lowest significant applicable input: Level 1 reflects financial instruments quoted in an active market.
Level 2 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
Level 3 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
For investments that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing the categorisation based on the lowest significant applicable input at the date of the event that caused the transfer.
g Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand, overdrafts and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts when applicable.
h Dividends payable to shareholders Dividends to shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are paid or approved in general meetings and are taken to the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Dividends declared and approved by the Company after the Balance Sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the Balance Sheet date.
i Foreign currency translation Transactions in currencies other than Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Items that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
j Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and have been allocated 30% 2014: 30% to revenue and 70% 2014: 70% to capital.
This complies with the SORP, which requires the finance costs of the Debenture Stock to be allocated between revenue and capital in the same proportions as the management fee.
k Debenture pricing 1 The 8 % Debenture Stock 2023 is valued at amortised cost under the effective interest method and secured by a floating charge over all assets of the 8 1 Company.
Costs in relation to arranging the debt finance of the 8 % Debenture Stock 2023 have been capitalised and are amortised over the term of 8 the finance.
Further details of the Debenture Stock are disclosed in notes 12 and 17. l Capital reserve Capital reserve other The following are taken to this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments.
amortisation of issue expenses: costs of share buybacks: exchange difference of a capital nature: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, allocated to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
Capital reserve investment holding gains The following are taken to this reserve: increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at the year end.
53 British Empire Trust plc Company Summary IFC Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report 02 17 Investment Review 18 31 Governance 32 45 Financial Statements 46 76 Shareholder Information 77 82 m Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the share premium on shares issued on the acquisition of Selective Assets Trust plc on 13 October 1995. n Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at fair value.
o Income Dividends received from UK registered companies are accounted for net of imputed tax credits.
Dividends from overseas companies are shown gross of any non-recoverable withholding taxes which are disclosed separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Dividends receivable on quoted equity shares are taken to revenue on an ex-dividend basis.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are brought into account when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time-apportioned basis.
Special dividends are taken to revenue or capital account depending on their nature.
In deciding whether a dividend should be regarded as a capital or revenue receipt, the Board reviews all relevant information as to the reasons for the sources of the dividend on a case by case basis.
All other income is accounted for on a time-apportioned accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
p Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the net revenue for the year and takes into account taxation deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Full provision for deferred taxation is made under the liability method, without discounting, on all timing differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that have arisen but not been reversed by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
q Significant accounting judgements As discussed in note 1 a Basis of preparation IFRS 10 includes an exemption from consolidation of subsidiaries for all entities that meet the definition of an investment entity, and instead measure them at fair value through profit or loss.
The primary criteria that must be met in order to meet the definition of an investment company is as follows: an entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: an entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis: and an entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment services.
The Board has agreed with the recommendation of the Audit Committee that the Company meets the definition of an investment entity as it satisfies each of the criteria above and that this accounting treatment better reflects the Companys activities as an investment trust.
The Companys principal activity as an investment trust and its investment approach is detailed in the Strategic Report.
The criteria and these conclusions are re-assessed by the Board annually.

56 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued At 30 September 2015 the Company had unrelieved management expenses of 40,457,000, 30 September 2014: 32,589,000 that are available to offset future taxable revenue.
A deferred tax asset of 8,091,000 has not been recognised because the Company is not expected to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in excess of the available deductible expenses and, accordingly, the Company is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus losses.
Deferred tax is not provided on capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments because the Trust meets and intends to continue for the foreseeable future to meet the conditions for approval as an Investment Trust company.
Unrecognised tax losses The Company has a tax loss of 40,896,000 2014: 32,589,000 carried forward at the Balance Sheet date which is available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits.
A potential deferred tax asset of 8,179,200 2014: 6,517,800 based on 20% tax rate has not been recognised in respect of this tax loss as there is uncertainty over whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which this tax loss can be offset.

Financial instruments and capital disclosures Risk management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Company is to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value.
The Companys financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances and borrowings.
The Company makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
The Company may also enter into derivative transactions which comprise forward foreign exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Companys investing activities and quoted options on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Board sets out its investment policies on page 34.
The Board and Investment Manager consider and review the risks inherent in managing the Companys assets which are detailed below.

Sterling Euro CAD$ US$ Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 30 September 2014 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 6,041 19,738 25,779 Other receivables 46 740 79 352 2,008 3,225 Cash and cash equivalents 5,852 141 1 5,994 Other payables 4,233 2,080 6,313 1 8 % Debenture Stock 2023 14,936 14,936 8 Provision for deferred tax 19 19 Currency exposure on net monetary items 7,249 740 220 18,010 2,009 13,730 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 116,423 227,409 84,331 194,967 190,124 813,254 Total net currency exposure 109,174 228,149 84,551 212,977 192,133 826,984 The value of the Companys assets and the total return earned by the Companys shareholders can be significantly affected by foreign exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets are denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling, the currency in which the Companys financial statements are prepared.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to Pounds Sterling upon receipt.
62 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Over the year, Sterling strengthened against two of the Companys principal investing currencies, the Canadian Dollar by 12.1% 2014: 8.84% and the Euro by 5.7% 2014: 7.28%, but weakened against the US Dollar by 6.6% 2014: strengthened by 0.11%.
A 5% rise or decline of Sterling against foreign currency denominated i. e. non Pound Sterling assets and liabilities held at the year end would have decreased increased the total return and net asset value by 27,073,000 2014: 35,891,000.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of investments in fixed-interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: the interest payable on variable rate borrowings: and the fair value of the Companys long-term debt.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short-term borrowings being used when required.
The Debenture Stock, issued by the Company as a planned level of gearing, pays a fixed rate of interest and is carried in the Companys Balance Sheet at amortised cost rather than at fair value.
Hence, movements in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the Companys share price and discount premium, which is not likely to be material.
Further information on the Debenture Stock is shown in note 12.
The exposure at 30 September of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates fixed interest rates At At 30 September 30 September 2015 2014 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 6,649 5,994 If the above level of cash was maintained for a year, a 1% increase decrease in LIBOR would increase decrease the revenue return and net assets by 66,000 2014: 60,000.

The maturity dates and the nominal interest rates on the investments held at fair value through profit or loss are shown in the Investment Portfolio on page 15.
The weighted average effective interest rate on these investments is 0% 2014: 0.15%.
The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 14,978,000 2014: 25,779,000.
A 1% increase decrease in relevant market interest rates would be expected to decrease increase the portfolios value by approximately 150,000 2014: 58,000, all other factors being equal.
The fair value of the Companys Debenture Stock at the year end was 19,275,000 2014: 18,525,000.
A 1% increase decrease in the applicable interest rates would be expected to decrease increase the fair values of the Debenture Stock by approximately 1,122,000 2014: 1,198,000, all other factors being equal.

The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the Investment Portfolio is set out on pages 14 and 15.
If the fair value of the Companys investments at the year end increased or decreased by 10%, then it would have had an effect on the Companys capital return and equity equal to 70,705,000 2014: 83,878,000.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be easily sold to meet funding commitments, if necessary.
Unlisted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
The risk is taken into account by the Directors when arriving at their valuation of these items.
The remaining contractual payments on the Companys financial liabilities at 30 September, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: In more than In more than In more than 1 year but 2 years but 3 years but In 1 year not more not more not more or less than 2 years than 3 years than 10 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 At 30 September 2015 1 8 % Debenture Stock 2023 1,219 1,219 1,219 20,788 24,445 8 Other payables 5,332 5,332 Deferred tax 6,551 1,219 1,219 20,788 29,777 In more than In more than In more than 1 year but 2 years but 3 years but In 1 year not more not more not more or less than 2 years than 3 years than 11 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 At 30 September 2014 1 8 % Debenture Stock 2023 1,219 1,219 1,219 22,007 25,664 8 Other payables 6,313 6,313 Deferred tax 19 19 7,551 1,219 1,219 22,007 31,996 Comprises the remaining interest payments to 2023, together with the principal to be repaid in 2023. Credit risk Credit risk is mitigated by diversifying the counterparties through whom the Investment Manager conducts investment transactions.
The credit standing of all counterparties is reviewed periodically with limits set on amounts due from any one counterparty.
The total credit exposure of the Company at the year end as shown on the Balance Sheet and Investment Portfolio was 25,748,000 2014: 34,998,000.
The total credit exposure represents the carrying value of fixed income, cash and receivable balances and totals 25,748,000 2014: 34,998,000, as detailed in the table on page 61.
64 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Except for the Companys Debenture Stock measured at amortised cost as shown below, the financial assets and financial liabilities of the Company are either carried in the Balance Sheet at their fair value investments, or the Balance Sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, cash at bank and due to brokers.

The fair value of the Companys unquoted investments is measured by the Directors using valuation methodologies in accordance with IPEVC guidelines and in accordance with the Company's accounting policies as set out on pages 50 to 53.
Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant assets as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data for the asset or liability.
The tables below set out fair value measurements of financial instruments as at the year end, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value: through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
These reviews include: the level of gearing, which takes account of the Companys position and the Investment Managers views on the market: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: a as a public company, the Company is required to have a minimum share capital of 50,000: and b in accordance with the provisions of sections 832 and 833 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company, as an investment company: i is only able to make a dividend distribution to the extent that the assets of the Company are equal to at least one and a half times its liabilities after the dividend payment has been made: and ii is required to make a dividend distribution each year such that it does not retain more than 15% of the income that it derives from shares and securities.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them at all times.
