Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less provision for bad debts.
A provision for bad debt is established when there isobjective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default ordelinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Receivables with a short-term duration are not discounted.
A loss on provision for bad debt is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
Amounts due from customers for contract work includes long-term contract balances and amounts due from contract customers, less attributable progress payments.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when itbecomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of long-term contract balances for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and the remainder is included as amounts due tolong-term contract customers within trade and other payables.
Losses are determined onthebasis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are updated regularly.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to Group performance, as cash received on customers account.
Amounts due from contract customers represent unbilled income and are stated at cost, plus attributable profit.
