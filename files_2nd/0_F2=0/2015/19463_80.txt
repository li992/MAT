24 Lease arrangements Accounting policy Assets held under leases which confer rights and obligations similar to those attaching to owned assets are classified as assets held under finance leases and capitalised within property, plant and equipment or software and the corresponding liability to pay rentals is shown net of interest in the statement of financial position as obligations under finance leases.
The capitalised value of the assets is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the periods of the leases or the useful lives of the assets concerned.
The interest element of the lease payments is allocated so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
The Group has exposures to sub-lease shortfalls in respect of certain property leases for periods up to 2024.
Provisions are recognised for net liabilities expected to arise on these exposures.
