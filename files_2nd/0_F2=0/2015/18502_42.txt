Fidessa has unrecognised tax losses of 0.5 million 2014: nil arising in subsidiaries that are at early stage development.
The tax losses may be available for use by offset against future taxable profits in the subsidiaries in which the losses arise.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these tax losses as the availability and timing of future profits in these subsidiaries cannot be determined with sufficient certainty.
There are temporary differences which arise in relation to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
Since Fidessa is able to control dividend distributions from these companies it is unlikely that further UK tax on repatriation of these earnings will be payable in the foreseeable future.
Consequently no deferred tax liability has been provided.
