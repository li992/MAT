barclays annualreport  I 271 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value The notes included in this section focus on assets and liabilities the Group holds and recognises at fair value.
Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an arms-length transaction with a willing counterparty, which may be an observable market price or, where there is no quoted price for the instrument, may be an estimate based on available market data.
Detail regarding the Groups approach to managing market risk can be found on pages 134 and 135.
