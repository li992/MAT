Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
On 22 December 2015, the Company entered into an intercompany derivative trade with a wholly owned subsidiary, Tullow Oil SPE limited SPE, paying consideration of $676.3 million in exchange for the right to receive all future receipts, and assumes all future obligations under SPEs existing and future oil derivative contracts with external counterparties.
The consideration paid is considered to be at fair value on the date of the transaction.
As at 31 December 2015, none of the Companys derivatives have been designated into hedging relationships at entity level.
As such, derivative fair value movements in the year have been recognised immediately in the income statement.

All of the Companys derivatives are Level 2 2014: n a.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
