Items related to Discontinued operations included within the Groups profit are detailed below: Gross Tax Net Year ended 30 June 2015 US$M US$M US$M Gain on loss of control of Manganese business 2,146 2,146 Impairment of South32 assets upon classification as held for distribution 1,897 148 1,749 Loss on demerger net of transaction costs 2,381 62 2,319 Derecognition of deferred tax assets 232 232 Repeal of Minerals Resource Rent Tax legislation 111 111 2,132 133 2,265 BHP Billiton Annual Report 2015 255 7 Financial Statementscontinued 29 Discontinued operations continued Gain on loss of control of Manganese business In contemplation of the demerger, the Group and Anglo American agreed to make certain changes to the agreement which governs their interests in the Manganese business.
The changes resulted in the Group and Anglo American agreeing to share joint control of the Manganese business.
On 2 March 2015, the Group ceased consolidation of the Manganese business and accounted for its 60 per cent interest as an equity accounted joint venture.
The remeasurement to fair value at that date gave rise to a gain of US$2,146 million.
There were no tax consequences arising from the remeasurement of the Manganese business.
Impairment of South32 assets upon classification as held for distribution As the fair value of South32 shares, determined by reference to the Australian Securities Exchange volume weighted average price over the first five days of trading, was less than the book value of the assets distributed, the Group considered whether any of the assets within South32 were impaired at the time they became held for distribution.
The Group recognised an impairment of US$1,358 million after tax benefit for its Manganese business due to the fall in the price of manganese and an impairment of US$391 million after tax benefit at the Wolvekrans Middelburg complex within Energy Coal South Africa due to a decline in export prices and a new rail agreement negatively impacting volumes.
Loss on demerger net of transaction costs The Group recognised the demerger in the financial statements as a dividend, reducing retained earnings by the fair value of South32s shares.
The US$1,795 million loss on demerger is the difference between the fair value of South32s shares and the book value of the assets distributed and the reclassification of reserves relating to South32 to the income statement.
Transaction costs of US$524 million after tax benefit comprised stamp duty, professional fees and separation and establishment costs.
Derecognition of deferred tax assets The Group derecognised deferred tax assets as a result of internal structuring transactions of South32 assets into the demerged entity.
Repeal of Minerals Resource Rent Tax legislation The legislation to repeal the Minerals Resource Rent Tax MRRT in Australia took effect on 30 September 2014.
As a result, the Group derecognised an MRRT deferred tax asset net of income tax consequences of which US$111 million related to South32 assets.
A corresponding taxation charge of US$111 million was recognised in the period.
There were no exceptional items related to Discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2014.
Items related to Discontinued operations included within the Groups profit for the year ended 30 June 2013 are detailed below: Gross Tax Net Year ended 30 June 2013 US$M US$M US$M Impairment of Worsley assets 2,190 559 1,631 Other impairments 35 35 2,225 559 1,666 Impairment of Worsley assets The Group recognised an impairment of assets at Worsley as a result of expected continued strength in the Australian dollar and weak alumina prices.
A total impairment charge of US$1,631 million after tax benefit was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2013.
Other impairments The Group reviewed the status of a minor capital project at the Cerro Matoso nickel operation, which resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of US$35 million after tax benefit in the year ended 30 June 2013.
