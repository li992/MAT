01 Strategic report 02 Corporate governance 03 Financial statements 04 Other information SECTION 4: FUNDING The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and equity.
The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging instruments: its exposure to market risks: and its capital management policies.
4.1 Borrowings Accounting policies Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
On 10 October 2013 the Group issued a convertible bond.
The unsecured instrument pays a coupon of 2.5% until 10 October 2018.
In accordance with IFRS, the equity and debt components of the bond are accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt component has been determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
As a result, 80.3 million was recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, 9.6 million, which represents the equity component, was credited to reserves.
The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value is amortised through the income statement from the date of issue.
Issue costs of 2.0 million were allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component is being amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity of 0.2 million are not amortised.
The table below analyses the Groups borrowings which comprise bank and other loans by when they fall due for payment: Group Company 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m Current In one year or less, or on demand 31.3 12.5 1.4 Non-current In more than one year but not more than two years 1.5 40.5 In more than two years but not more than five years 202.2 106.7 83.0 81.2 In more than five years 240.1 330.1 90.0 90.0 443.8 477.3 173.0 171.2 Total borrowings 475.1 489.8 174.4 171.2 In addition to the borrowings currently drawn as shown above, the Group has available undrawn facilities of 174.0 million 2014: 76.5 million.
A further overdraft facility of 10.0 million 2014: 10.0 million is also available.
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Groups fixed rate loans carried at 331.4 million 2014: 332.5 million and the convertible bond carried at 84.3 million 2014: 82.5.
The convertible bond and 90.0 million 2014: 90.0 million of the fixed rate loans are classified as level 1 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have a fair value of 218.4 million 2014: 194.5 million.
The IFRS 13 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
The remaining 241.4 million 2014: 242.5 million of the fixed rate loans are classified as level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of these fixed rate loans has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates.
The fair value of these loans is 226.4 million 2014: 224.0 million.
Properties with a carrying value of 993.6 million 2014: 651.9 million have been pledged as security against the Groups drawn down borrowings.
