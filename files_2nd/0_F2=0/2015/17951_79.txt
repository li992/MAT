The transaction was completed on 30 September 2015.
The purchase price is subject to the final agreement of adjustments for certain liabilities, and part of the consideration is contingent upon certain targets being met post-acquisition.
TDR is the leading independent cigarette manufacturer in Central Europe with a market leading position in Croatia and a position of scale in Bosnia and Serbia which will provide the Group with the opportunity to significantly grow its business in the region.
By combining its existing business in South East Europe together with TDR, the Group expects to benefit from highly skilled people, well established brands, local high quality operations and strong relationships with distributors and retailers in these markets.
As part of the transaction, the Group has committed to keeping TDRs manufacturing facility in Kanfanar, Croatia operational for at least five years following completion of the acquisition.
The provisional goodwill of 116 million on the acquisition of TDR, stated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction, arises as follows: Provisional values Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Intangible assets 2 159 161 Property, plant and equipment 69 26 95 Investments in associates 8 5 13 Deferred tax assets 3 3 Inventories 53 8 61 Trade and other receivables 101 101 Cash and cash equivalents 4 4 Borrowings 27 27 Deferred tax liabilities 32 32 Provisions 8 22 30 Trade and other payables 50 50 Net assets 155 144 299 Less: Non-controlling interests 2 2 Net assets acquired 297 Goodwill 116 Total consideration 413 Included in the fair value of consideration above is 9 million of contingent consideration.

The contribution of this business to the Groups results in 2015 was not material.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2015, the Groups results for the year would not have been materially different.
