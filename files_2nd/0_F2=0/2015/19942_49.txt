Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Anyimpairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the net amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In prior years the amortisation element of the deemed cost at 30 September 2004 was shown separately: inthe current year this has been deducted from gross cost.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit CGU, discounted to their present value using risk adjusted discount factors to give its value in use.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated exceeds itsvalue in use and are recognised in the income statement.
