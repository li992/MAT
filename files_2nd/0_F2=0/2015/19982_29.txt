The award was granted on 18 September 2015.
Given the short period between the grant date and the vesting date i. e. the IPO date on 16 October 2015, it has been considered that the fair value at grant date would not be materially different from the fair value at the vesting date.
Total expenses recognised in the Groups income statement are 12.6m.
Phantom share award Certain employees were granted a cash-settled award scheme which was settled in the year.
Total expenses recognised in the Groups income statement is 16.7m.

The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax charges and credits are recognised in the income statement unless they arise from a transaction recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity.

Diluted earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the financial period adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options.
The dilutive effect is calculated on the full exercise of all potentially dilutive Ordinary Share options granted by the Group,  options which the Group considers to have been earned.
When a loss is recognised during a financial period, a basic loss per share rather than a basic earnings per share will be recognised.
Thedilutive effects will not be considered in calculating the diluted loss per share as this would reduce the loss pershare.
The weighted average number of shares used to determine earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with the principle ofreverse acquisition accounting.
Underlying basic and diluted earnings per share are included as the Directors believe this provides a better reflection of the Groupsperformance.

137 Overview Worldpay Group plc Strategic report Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3 Non-current assets This section shows assets used by the Group to generate revenue and profits.
These assets include customer relationships, brands, computer software and goodwill.
The Groups physical assets are also shown in this section.
Note 3a Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, less any non-controlling interest.
Goodwill is carried at the cost established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is not amortised.
m Cost At 1 December 2014 1,215.7 Acquisition of SecureNet 44.7 Foreign exchange impact 0.5 At 31 December 2014 1,260.9 Adjustment to SecureNet goodwill 0.2 Foreign exchange impact 14.2 At 31 December 2015 1,275.3 Net Book Value At 31 December 2015 1,275.3 At 31 December 2014 1,260.9 Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation is performed at least annually and requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The corporate planning process includes the preparation of the annual budget as well as the Groups long-term strategic plan.
Thestrategic plan provides medium to long-term direction for the Group and is reviewed on an annual basis.
It includes a five-year outlook for the business including managements view on the future achievable growth in market share and the capital expenditure required to achieve it.
The cash flows included in the strategic plan are used for the value in use calculations.
Key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are: Average Average growth rate growth rate Terminal in sales in costs growth rate Discount rate 31 December 2015 5.3-16.9% 2.6-12.5% 2.0% 8.0-10.0% 31 December 2014 7.0-17.3% 3.3-18.2% 2.0% 10.6-11.5% The sensitivity of goodwill carrying values to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions has been performed.
No changes produce a significant movement in the carrying value of goodwill allocated to a CGU and therefore no sensitivity analysis is presented.
Should the value in use be lower than the carrying value, the resultant impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill, then to remaining assets of the CGU pro rata based on their carrying amount.
No asset is impaired below its own recoverable amount.
The impairment loss is recognised immediately in separately disclosed items in the income statement.
Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent periods.

These are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequently, they are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any.
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life.
The estimated useful economic lives and the amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with any changes being accounted for on a prospective basis.
The useful lives applied by the Group are: Customer relationships 3 to 20 years Brands 3 to 25 years Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets.
These costs include directly attributable employee costs.
However, any costs incurred in the research phase or as maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Computer software is amortised over its useful life which is three to ten years.

140 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3 Non-current assets continued Note 3c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment includes terminals, leasehold improvements and computers and office equipment.
Property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at cost.
Cost includes all expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent measurement of property, plant and equipment is at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that it will give rise to future benefits, i. e. maintenance expenditure is excluded but enhancement costs may be included.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated to its residual value over its useful life on a straight-line basis.
Estimates of the useful life and residual value, as well as the method of depreciation, are reviewed as a minimum at the end of each reporting period.
Any changes are classified as a change in accounting estimate and so are applied prospectively.
Depreciation rates for each category of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Terminals one to five years Leasehold improvements five to twenty years Computers and office equipment three to five years Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for use and ceases on disposal of the asset, classification as held for sale or the end of its useful life, whichever is the sooner.
The gain or loss on disposal is the difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying amount of the asset.

If such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of the asset or its cash-generating unit, if the asset does not generate largely independent cash flows, is estimated.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows from the asset or the cash-generating unit, discounted at the appropriate pre-tax rate.
The Group recognises any impairment loss resulting from these reviews in separately disclosed items in the income statement.
Impairment losses, except those arising on goodwill, may be reversed in subsequent periods.
However, the revised carrying value of the asset may not exceed the carrying value had the original impairment not arisen.
An exercise was undertaken to ascertain whether any of the Platform assets were impaired.
This review resulted in an impairment loss of nil 2014: 9.6m which has been included within separately disclosed items.

Note 4a Merchant float, scheme debtors and merchant creditors Merchant float, scheme debtors and merchant creditors represent intermediary balances arising in the merchant settlement process.
Merchant float represents surplus cash balances that the Group holds on behalf of its customers, when the incoming amount from the card schemes or networks precedes when the funding to customers falls due.
The funds are held in a fiduciary capacity.
They are excluded from the Group cash flow statement to provide greater clarity over the Groups own cash movements.
Scheme debtors consist primarily of: The Groups receivables from the card schemes or networks for transactions processed on behalf of customers, where it is a member of that particular scheme or network: The Groups receivables from the card schemes or networks for transactions where it has by exception funded customers in advance of receipt of card association funding: and Other net receivables from the schemes.
Merchant creditors consist primarily of: The Groups liability to customers for transactions that have been processed but not yet funded by the card schemes or networks, where it is a member of that particular scheme or network: The Groups liability to the customers for transactions for which it is holding funding from the members under the sponsorship agreement but has not funded customers on behalf of the members: and Merchant reserves and the fair value of the Groups guarantees of cardholder chargebacks.
These are amounts held as deposits from customers, either from inception of Worldpays working relationship with them, or accrued throughout the relationship due to payment issues arising or potential chargebacks.
Note 4b Inventory The Groups inventory consists of terminals held for sale of 0.4m 2014: 1.3m.
Inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is reassessed at each reporting date.
Cost is based on the weighted average cost of the items held in stock, calculated monthly.
Any write down to net realisable value is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs: similarly any reversal of this write down is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs.
When inventory is sold, its current carrying value is recognised as an expense in the period in which the associated revenue isrecognised.
Note 4c Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value in the period to which they relate.
They are held at amortised cost, less any provision for bad or doubtful debts.
Provisions for bad or doubtful debts are presented net with the related receivable on the balance sheet.

The maximum margin for Term Facility 1 is 2.00% and for Term Facility 2 is 2.50%.
On 10 November 2015, the Group issued 500m 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 2022, the proceeds of which were used to reduce Term Facility 1.
The issue extended the average term of the Groups debt, diversified its funding sources and fixed the interest rate on this portion of the debt.

Classification depends on the substance of the lease transaction rather than the legal form of the lease agreement.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership lie with the lessee, the lease is classified as a finance lease.
All other arrangements identified as leases are considered to be an operating lease.
Finance leases Where the Group is lessee of a finance lease, it recognises both the leased asset and a finance lease liability.
The asset is amortised or depreciated over its useful life or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.
The finance lease liability is unwound over the life of the lease at the rate implicit in the lease.
Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: 2015 2014 Present value Present value Future of minimum Future of minimum minimum lease lease minimum lease lease payments Interest payments payments Interest payments m m m m m m Less than one year 16.1 1.1 15.0 13.9 1.2 12.7 One to five years 14.8 0.6 14.2 16.2 0.7 15.5 30.9 1.7 29.2 30.1 1.9 28.2 The Group entered into leasing arrangements for certain tangible fixed assets in 2015.
The majority of finance leases have a lease term of five years.
For the current financial period the average effective borrowing rate was 5.2% 2014: 5.3%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date and all finance lease obligations are denominated in Sterling.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets.
Operating lease arrangements Operating lease income expense is taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
Any lease incentives are spread over the life of the lease.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had obligations to make non-cancellable operating lease payments as follows: 2015 2014 Land and Office Land and Office buildings equipment Vehicles buildings equipment Vehicles m m m m m m Within one year 8.5 0.4 6.1 0.5 Between one and five years 47.7 0.4 37.0 0.7 After five years 70.6 80.3 Total 126.8 0.8 123.4 1.2 150 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 5 Financing and equity continued Note 5e Financial instruments On initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are classified into the relevant category and recognised at fair value.
Their subsequent measurement, at either fair value or amortised cost, is dependent upon their initial classification.
Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Individual non-derivatives and their treatment are explained in their separate notes.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial asset, or the contractual rights expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Group operates net investment hedges, using foreign currency borrowings.
The effective portion of the foreign exchange gain orloss on retranslation of the hedging instrument is taken to the foreign currency translation reserve.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the hedged investment is disposed of then any balance held in reserves is recycled to the income statement.
In the current year, a loss of 8.2m 2014: 4.5m was taken to the foreign exchange reserve in relation to net investment hedging.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fairvalue at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the endof each reporting period.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in separately disclosed items in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Financial assets 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 m m Trade receivables 288.8 276.4 Other receivables 14.1 29.9 Own cash and cash equivalents 165.3 168.7 Financial assets Visa Europe shares see Note 5i 195.7 Amount due from former parent companies 1.5 663.9 476.5 Financial liabilities 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 m m Trade payables 133.8 126.8 Other liabilities 59.9 38.6 Finance leases 29.2 28.2 Borrowings 1,561.4 2,394.6 Financial liabilities CVR liabilities see Note 5i 140.9 Amount due to Employee Benefit Trust and former parent companies 8.7 1,925.2 2,596.9 151 Overview Worldpay Group plc Strategic report Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information Note 5e Financial instruments continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management The Group operates throughout the world, with major operations in the United Kingdom, Europe and the US.
Foreign currency risk is managed at a Group level, focusing on two distinct areas: Group assets and liabilities and customer transactions relating to the Groups payment business.
Where there is a difference in settlement currency, the time between receipt and settlement is generally limited to a small number of days and therefore the foreign exchange risk is substantially mitigated.

The Groups debt agreements include contractual interest rate floors.
Cash held at variable rates offsets risk arising from changing interest rates on the Groups borrowings.
An increase of 1.00% in float income arising from cash balances receiving floating rate interest.
The net impacts of the above would be increased costs of 8.6m 2014: 3.7m increase in costs.

153 Overview Worldpay Group plc Strategic report Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information Note 5e Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Credit risk arises from the failure of a merchant or partner bank or alternative payments provider to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms.
Further information is included in the Principal risks and uncertainties section of this report on page 61.
Liquidity risk management The Groups liquidity risk management focuses on two distinct areas: own cash and settlement cash for customers relating to the Groups payment business.
Own cash The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due.
This is achieved by holding significant cash balances and maintaining sufficient committed headroom.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had own cash balances of 165.3m 2014: 168.7m and available headroom under its revolving credit facility of 160.0m.
The revolving credit facility the Group used to have prior to the IPO had a limit of 75.0m, out of which 25.0m was available at the end of 2014.
Settlement cycle The Groups payment business has a short-term settlement cycle where card schemes predominantly Visa and MasterCard remit cash and the Group pays merchants from these remittances within three days.
The majority of funds are received prior to remittance to the merchant, resulting in significant cash balances relating to the settlement cycle.
The Group has an Intra-Day Agreement Facility of 1.4bn to ensure payments can be processed whilst awaiting cardscheme remittances.

These shares are a liability by nature and therefore are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet and are described in more detail in Note 5i.
On the same day, the Company sub-divided the remaining Ordinary Shares by reducing the nominal value from 1.00 per share to 0.03 per share.
On 16 October 2015, the Company issued 394,916,667 Ordinary Shares with a premium of 2.37 per share.
At 31 December 2015, all Ordinary Shares are fully paid up at par.
The holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to dividends and one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
Note 5g Capital resources The Groups capital consists of equity, comprising issued share capital, share premium, capital contribution and retained earnings.
The regulated entities within the Group are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital.
This ensures the Company has sufficient capital resources for the activities required to undertake payment services.
The capital employed in the Company, together with the reserves, ensure that a buffer to the minimum regulatory capital requirement is achieved.
154 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 5 Financing and equity continued Note 5h Other equity As part of the Group restructuring in preparation for the IPO, the Company effected a capital reduction which resulted in a transfer of 818.7m from share premium to retained earnings.
During the IPO process, 31.4m was received from the former parent companies to fund various share award schemes the Group granted.
Details of the two awards can be found in Note 2c.
When the share award schemes were granted, the Group purchased its own shares in order to hedge the cash outflow upon the exercise of the schemes.
As at year end, the Group held 9,866,475 of its own shares 23.7m.
Note 5i Visa Europe asset The Visa Europe asset represents the Groups approximate 5.9% interest in Visa Europe.
It is classified as a Fair Value through Profit and Loss FVTPL financial asset with the gain or loss on its fair value recognised in finance income in the Groups incomestatement.
Contingent Value Rights CVRs CVRs are a separate class of shares in the Company.
They are non-voting and are not convertible into Ordinary Shares.
Given the nature of the CVRs, they are classified as financial liabilities recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, with the gain or loss recognised in finance costs in the Groups income statement.
Further details of the CVRs are set out in Worldpays Prospectus dated 13 October 2015.
Proposed disposal of Visa Europe shares On 2 November 2015, we announced the proposed disposal of our interest in Visa Europe to Visa Inc.
The disposal, which is expected to complete in Q2 2016, is a result of Visa Inc. s agreement to purchase 100% of Visa Europe, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
Under the terms of the disposal, Worldpay will receive a mixture of cash and non-cash consideration currently estimated to be worth in aggregate up to 1.2bn.
This is made up of up-front consideration of approximately 544m cash and 375m of Series B Preferred stock in Visa Inc.
In addition, if the earnout pays out in full, Worldpay could receive in the region of 283m in earnout conditional upon achieving certain criteria relating to the incremental net revenue of Visa Europe during the earnout period.
The up-front consideration will be reduced by any finalsettlement of potential liabilities relating to ongoing interchange related litigation involving Visa Europe.
Potential losses from interchange litigation liabilities will be set against the Preferred stock which can be reduced to absorb those losses.
A Loss Sharing Agreement entered into by Worldpay, along with the ten other largest UK members of Visa Europe, provides a second level of protection to Visa Inc. capped at the value of the cash consideration received.
The Groups share of such liabilities arising from the UK interchange related litigation is capped at the Groups up-front consideration.
The holders of the CVRs will be entitled to 90% of the post-tax net proceeds of the disposal in accordance with the terms of the CVRs subject to the Companys right of retention mentioned above, with Worldpay retaining 10% of the net proceeds.
Following the disposal, Worldpay will continue to be a participant in the Visa payments system.
It is anticipated that Worldpay will no longer have representation on the Board of Visa Europe following completion of the disposal as a result of Visa Europe ceasing to be amember-owned association.
Accounting treatment Visa Europe asset As at 30 June 2015 and on IPO completion, the Visa Europe asset was recognised in the Groups balance sheet as a FVTPL financial asset with a fair value of nil.
In accordance with IAS 39, financial assets should be re-measured at each reporting date.
In performing the revaluation at 31 December 2015, the offer by Visa Inc. to purchase Visa Europe has been taken into account inthe subsequent measure of fair value, despite the fact that there remains some uncertainty around both the likelihood of completion of the deal which is still subject to anti-trust clearance, and the amount of pre-transaction operational liabilities which would reduce the up-front consideration received.
When measuring the fair value of those assets, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
155 Overview Worldpay Group plc Strategic report Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information Note 5i Visa Europe asset continued The Visa Europe asset is classified as Level 3 due to the lack of identical transactions with regularly available market prices.
In order to fair value the financial asset as at 31 December 2015, the Directors have considered a range of potential outcomes and calculated a weighted average, considering the likelihood of various factors, including the expected likelihood of the transaction completing, the likely value of the potential level of Visa Europe liabilities that the Group may be liable for and the timing of cash flows.
CVR liabilities The CVR liabilities were recognised at nil fair value on initial recognition.
At year end, they were re-measured at amortised cost based on a re-estimation of future cash flows, with any changes being recognised in the income statement.
Discounting The weighted average of the outcomes were discounted to reflect the time value of money.
Under IAS 39, the financial asset should be discounted using the market participants weighted average cost of capital WACC whereas the financial liabilities should be discounted using the Groups WACC.
In this instance, the difference between using the market participants WACC and the Groups WACC is not material.
Conclusion Based on the above, the following has been recognised in the Groups 2015 financial statements: Year ended 31 December 2015 m Balance sheet Financial assets Visa Europe shares 195.7 Financial liabilities CVR liabilities 140.9 Deferred tax liabilities 39.2 Net assets 15.6 Income statement Financial income Visa Europe shares 195.7 Finance costs CVR liabilities not tax deductible see Note 2g 140.9 Profit before tax 54.8 Taxation 39.2 Profit after tax 15.6 Sensitivity analysis Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the significant unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have the following effects: Financial Financial assets Visa liabilities Profit Europe shares CVR liabilities after tax m m m 5% change in the likelihood of the transaction completion 12.3 8.8 0.9 5% swing in the estimation of the impact of the loss-sharing agreement 19.6 14.1 1.6 156 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 6 Group comparison subsidiaries, acquisitions and disposals This section shows the Groups subsidiaries, details about subsidiaries the Group has acquired during the period and prior periods and details about any subsidiaries that have been disposed of during the period and prior periods.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Worldpay Group plc and entities controlled by it its subsidiaries.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of Worldpay Group plc and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
The period end assets and liabilities of the entities are consolidated with those of Worldpay Group plc and presented in the consolidated balance sheet.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the IFRS policies used by the Group and for any fair value adjustments required on consolidation.
All intra-Group balances, income and expenses and the effect of any intra-Group profits on the balance sheet are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Note 6a Investments in subsidiaries An entity is classified as a subsidiary of the Group when the Group has control over that entity, either through majority shareholding or other means.
Acquisitions Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value: it includes cash, other assets transferred and any contingent consideration due to the former owners of theacquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The identifiable assets acquired and theliabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value as at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and any non-controlling interest overthe fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed plus any existing interest in the business acquired.
If the consideration transferred is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the following reporting period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
Disposals When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

All significant subsidiary undertakings have 31 December as their financial year ends.
Worldpay Group plc had 30 November as its financial year end until it was changed to 31 December on 3 July 2015.
All the above companies have been included in the Group consolidation.
The Group also has a joint venture and an associate as disclosed in Note 6b.
159 Overview Worldpay Group plc Strategic report Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information Note 6b Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method whereby the interest in the joint ventures and associates is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
The profit or loss of the Group includes the Groups share of the profit or loss of the joint ventures and associates.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
