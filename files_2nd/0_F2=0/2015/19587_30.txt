The Company will continue to provide registered shareholders with a confirmation of the dividends paid by SiG plc and this should be included with any other dividend income received when calculating and reporting total dividend income received.
it is the shareholders responsibility to include all dividend income when calculating any tax liability.
This change was announced by the Chancellor, as part of the UK government budget in July 2015. if you have any tax queries, please contact a Financial Advisor.
