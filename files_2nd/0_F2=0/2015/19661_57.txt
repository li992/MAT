Share-based payments The Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE provides UK employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company following a three-year vesting period.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date.
The exercise price is determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under SAYE.
Under the Performance Share Plan unapproved share options as defined by HMRC, the exercise price is the nominal cost of the Companys shares.
From 2014, awards to Spectris plc executives are subject to performance criteria: 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of an adjusted earnings per share growth target EPS, 33.33% of the award subject to a total shareholder return target TSR and 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of an economic profit target.
Awards to Spectris plc executives in the years up to 2013 are subject to performance criteria: 50% of the award being based on fulfilment of EPS and 50% of the award subject to TSR.
Awards to Spectris plc senior managers are still subject to these performance criteria.
Awards made to executives and senior managers of the Groups operating companies in 2008 and 2009 have performance criteria subject to EPS in respect of 50% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 50% of the award.
For awards made subsequent to 2009, the performance criteria are EPS in respect of 33.33% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 66.67% of the award.
Operating company manager awards up to 2013 were entirely subject to operating company profit targets.
All Performance Share Plan awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the seven-year period following vesting.
Since 2011, Performance Share Plan options have also been granted to UK employees that are approved share options as defined by HMRC.
The performance criteria and vesting conditions are consistent with the unapproved options granted described above.
The approved share options are linked to the unapproved share options in order to benefit from the tax-exempt status of approved share option grants to a value not exceeding 30,000.
Should there be a gain on exercise under the approved options, such gain will cause a proportionate reduction in the number and value of the linked unapproved options.
Should there be no gain on exercise under the approved options, these options are then forfeited and the linked unapproved options may be exercised in full, to the extent their performance criteria are met.
From 2014, awards were made under the Restricted Shares Plan to selected employees.
Awards vest three years from grant and are cash-settled on vesting.
The Restricted Shares Plan is subject to the same rules as the Performance Share Plan but gives flexibility as to whether or not awards are subject to performance criteria.
Awards under the Restricted Shares Plan may be granted to an employee of the Group, but may not be granted to an Executive Director of Spectris plc.

Share-based payments continued Share-based payment expense Share options are valued using the stochastic option pricing model also known as the Monte Carlo model, with support from an independent remuneration consultant.
The TSR performance condition was included in the calculation of fair value under the Performance Share Plan.
For options granted in 2014 and 2015, the fair value of options granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Performance Share Plan Performance Share Plan SAYE unapproved approved Restricted Shares Plan 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Weighted average share price at date of grant 16.78 19.92 22.08 23.16 21.99 22.70 22.00 23.68 Weighted average exercise price 17.37 20.15 0.05 0.05 21.79 23.03 0.05 0.05 Expected volatility 27.2% 31.8% n a n a 27.72% 32.7% n a n a Expected life 3.44 yrs 3.45 yrs 3 yrs 3 yrs 3 yrs 3 yrs 3 yrs 3yrs Risk-free rate 0.88% 1.40% 0.84% 1.08% 0.84% 1.07% n a n a Expected dividends expressed as a yield 2.85% 2.2% 0% 0% 2.12% 1.9% 0% 0% Fair value per option 2.19 3.61 Weighted average fair values at date of grant : Equity-settled TSR condition 12.11 12.25 3.59 4.44 Equity-settled Profit condition 21.78 23.55 3.68 4.37 Equity-settled EPS condition 21.69 22.97 3.69 4.47 Equity-settled Economic profit condition 22.17 22.26 3.76 4.61 Cash-settled TSR condition 13.19 13.93 n a n a Cash-settled Profit condition 22.17 23.64 22.17 23.64 Cash-settled EPS condition 22.02 23.64 22.02 23.64 Weighted average fair values at 31 December : Cash-settled TSR condition 4.90 8.08 n a n a Cash-settled Profit condition 16.96 20.03 17.37 20.41 Cash-settled EPS condition 16.96 20.03 17.32 20.35 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected term.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for unapproved share options exercised under the Performance Share Plan in 2015 was 19.67 2014: 22.18.
The weighted average fair value of cash-settled options outstanding at 31 December 2015 is 17.32 2014: 20.35 for the EPS condition.
The Group recognised a total share-based payment charge of 1.5m 2014: 2.3m in the Consolidated Income Statement, of which 0.7m 2014: 2.2m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
