Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8 Long-term business economic volatility continued The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other long-term business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equities and properties are: Equities Properties 2015 2014 2015 2014 % % % % United Kingdom 5.4 6.6 3.9 5.1 Eurozone 4.3 5.7 2.8 4.2 The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the opening 10-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.
These are the same assumptions as are used in MCEV reporting to calculate the longer-term investment return for the Groups long-term business.
For fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risks: this includes an adjustment for credit risk on all eurozone sovereign debt.
Where such securities are classified as available for sale, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.
9 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated longer-term return, which is included in operating profit, and short-term fluctuations from this, which are disclosed outside operating profit but are included in profit before tax.
This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: 2015 2014 Non-long-term business m m Short-term fluctuations in investment return see b below 84 261 Economic assumption changes see g below 100 145 184 116 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation are as follows: 2015 2014 Non-long-term business m m Analysis of investment income: Net investment income 327 754 Foreign exchange gains losses and other charges 10 8 317 746 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 401 485 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit General insurance and health 166 181 1 Other operations 82 80 84 261 317 746 1 Represents short-term fluctuations on assets backing non-long-term business in Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
Actual income and longer-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.
For other operations, the longer-term return reflects assets backing non-long-term business held in Group centre investments.

The impact of realised and unrealised gains and losses on Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme which is designed to economically protect the total Groups capital against adverse equity and foreign exchange movements, is included in short-term fluctuations on other operations.
The adverse movement in short-term fluctuations during 2015 compared with 2014 is mainly due to an increase in risk-free rates reducing fixed income security market values.
d The total assets supporting the general insurance and health business, which contribute towards the longer-term return, are: 2015 2014 m m Debt securities 9,608 10,858 Equity securities 217 251 Properties 335 223 Cash and cash equivalents 969 1,300 1 Other 3,008 3,767 Assets supporting general insurance and health business 14,137 16,399 2 Assets supporting other non-long-term business 538 562 Total assets supporting non-long-term business 14,675 16,961 1 Includes the internal loan.
2 Represents assets backing non-long-term business in Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the longer-term investment return are: Longer-term rates of Longer-term rates of return Equities return Properties 2015 2014 2015 2014 % % % % United Kingdom 5.4 6.6 3.9 5.1 Eurozone 4.3 5.7 2.8 4.2 Canada 5.8 6.8 4.3 5.3 To calculate the longer-term investment return for its non-long-term business in 2014 and 2015, the Group has applied the same economic assumptions for equities and properties as are used under MCEV principles.
e The table below compares the actual return on investments attributable to the non-long-term business, after deducting investment management expenses and charges, with the aggregate longer-term return over a five-year period.
2011-2015 2010-2014 m m Actual return attributable to shareholders 2,527 2,760 Longer-term return credited to operating results 2,945 3,293 Excess of longer-term returns over actual returns 418 533 f The table below shows the sensitivity of the Groups non-long-term business operating profit before tax to changes in the longer-term rates of return: 2015 2014 Movement in investment return for By Change in m m Equities 1% higher lower Group operating profit before tax 3 3 Properties 1% higher lower Group operating profit before tax 2 1 g The economic assumption changes arise as a result of an increase in the expected future inflation rates used to calculate claims reserves for periodic payment orders and a decrease in the swap rates used to discount latent claim reserves and periodic payment orders.
As explained in accounting policy L, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 40.
