In January 2016 GSK made further payments of 100 million in relation to UK Corporation tax.
These amounts are for Corporation tax only and do not include the various other business taxes borne by GSK each year.
A significant component of the deferred tax credit for each of 2015 and prior periods arose in respect of the remeasurement of the contingent consideration in relation to the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture.
In 2015 the credit also included the unwind of deferred tax liabilities on the disposal of the Groups Oncology business to Novartis.
In 2014 the credit also included recognition of a deferred tax asset on capital losses anticipated to be utilised on completion of the Novartis transaction.
The following table reconciles the tax charge calculated at the UK statutory rate on the Group profit before tax with the actual tax charge for the year.

The impact of differences in overseas taxation rates arose from profits being earned in countries with tax rates higher than the UK statutory rate, the most significant of which in 2015 were the US, India, France and Germany.
This was partially offset by the increased benefit of intellectual property incentives from the UK Patent Box and Belgian Patent Income Deduction regimes.
Such regimes provide a reduced rate of corporate income tax on profits earned from qualifying patents.
The impact of overseas tax rates was further offset by permanent differences on disposals during 2015 which were subject to the UK Substantial Shareholdings Exemption from tax.
In 2014 the anticipated Oncology disposal resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets on capital losses subsequently utilised in 2015.
The reduction in the benefit provided by R&D credits reects the change in the UK regime to record the benefit within the R&D expense in the income statement.
Re-assessments of prior year estimates in 2015 include a benefit of 498 million from the resolution of a number of tax matters in various countries.
Future tax charges, and therefore our effective tax rate, may be affected by factors such as acquisitions, disposals, restructurings, the location of research and development activity, tax regime reforms and resolution of open matters as we continue to bring our tax affairs up to date around the world.

158 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 14 Taxation continued Issues relating to taxation The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets.
GSKs biggest risk with respect to taxation is that different tax authorities will seek to attribute further profit to activities being undertaken in their jurisdiction potentially resulting in double taxation.
While GSK applies OECD established principles in matching the profit generated by each legal entity to the risk borne and value being added by each part of the value chain, this is inherently subjective and can be challenged by tax authorities.
This gives rise to complexity and delay in resolving audits with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
In calculating the tax liability of the Group, GSK applies a risk based approach to determine the transactions most likely to be subject to challenge and the probability that the Group would be able to obtain compensatory adjustments under international tax treaties.
There continues to be a significant international focus on tax reform including the OECDs BEPS project, and European Commission initiatives such as the proposed Anti-BEPS Directive and the increased use of scal state aid investigations.
Together with domestic initiatives around the world, these may result in significant changes to established tax principles and an increase in tax authority disputes.
In turn, this could affect adversely our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.
The Group continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate.
The aggregate amount of unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 16 billion 2014 20 billion.
UK legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most overseas profits, subject to certain exceptions.
Provision for deferred tax liabilities of 180 million 2014 147 million has been made in respect of withholding taxation that would arise on the distribution of profits by certain overseas subsidiaries.
The unremitted profits on which deferred tax has not been provided is 1.5 billion 2014 1.6 billion.
Deferred tax on distribution of these profits has not been provided on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the remaining temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
