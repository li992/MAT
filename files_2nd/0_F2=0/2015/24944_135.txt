Notes on the Financial Statements continued 32 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities 32 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities Accounting policy Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously the offset criteria.
The disclosure below has been enhanced this year with the inclusion of Amounts not subject to enforceable netting arrangements resulting in a change in the basis of preparation from the prior period.
Prior period data have been represented accordingly.
The Amounts not set off in the balance sheet in the following table for derivatives and reverse repurchase repurchase, stock borrowing lending and similar agreements include transactions where: the counterparty has an offsetting exposure with HSBC and a master netting or similar arrangement is in place with a right of set off only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy, or the offset criteria are otherwise not satisfied: and cash and non-cash collateral has been received pledged in respect of the transactions described above.
For loans and advances to customers and customer accounts at amortised cost the amounts included in the table below typically relate to transactions entered into with corporate and commercial customers for working capital management purposes.
The Amounts not set off in the balance sheet relate to transactions where the customer has an offsetting exposure with HSBC and an agreement is in place with the right of offset but the offset criteria are otherwise not satisfied.
For risk management purposes, the net amounts of such exposures are subject to limits which are monitored and the relevant customer agreements are subject to review and updated, as necessary, to ensure that the legal right of offset remains appropriate.
