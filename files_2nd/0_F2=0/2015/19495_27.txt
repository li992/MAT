ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 102 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000.
Rotork plc is a company domiciled in England.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The accounting policies contained below in note 1 and the disclosures in notes 2 to 30 all relate to the Group financial statements.
The Company balance sheet, Accounting policies and applicable notes can be found following note 30.
Accounting policies The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Rotork plc have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items referred to in the derivative financial instruments accounting policy below.
New accounting standards and interpretations The following narrow scope amendments which were issued as part of the IFRS Annual improvement cycles have been applied from 1 January 2015: Amendment to IAS19 Defined benefit plans Employee contributions IFRS2 Share-based payment Definition of vesting condition IFRS3 Business combination Accounting for contingent consideration IFRS8 Operating segments Aggregation of operating segments and Reconciliation of the total of reportable assets IFRS13 Fair value measurement Short-term receivable and payables IAS24 Related party disclosure Key management personnel services Application of these standards and amendments has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Recent accounting developments IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers has been issued but is not yet effective and has not been adopted as application was not mandatory for the year.
The new standard requires the separation of performance obligations within contracts with customers and the contractual value to be allocated to the performance obligations.
Once a performance obligation is satisfied revenue should be recognised on that element of the contract.
The introduction of the standard is likely to have some impact on Rotork but this is unlikely to be material due to the relatively straightforward contractual terms and conditions with customers.
An assessment will be carried out to understand the impact of this standard prior to it becoming effective in January 2018.
IFRS9 Financial Instruments has been issued but is not yet effective and has not been adopted as application was not mandatory for the year.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the disclosures, net assets or results of the Group.
IFRS16 Leases was issued on 13 January 2016 and has a mandatory effective date of 1 January 2019.
The new standard will eliminate the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases and result in operating leases being treated as finance leases.
This will result in previously recognised operating leases being treated as property, plant and equipment and a finance lease creditor.
The introduction of the standard will increase the value of property, plant and equipment and the finance lease liability on the balance sheet but it is unlikely to have a material impact on the profit in any year.
An assessment will be carried out to understand the full impact of the standard prior to it becoming effective in January 2019.
The narrow scope amendments in the Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 cycle which are mandatory for periods commencing after 1 January 2016 will not have a material impact on the disclosures, net assets or results of the Group.
Going concern After carrying out a detailed review of the viability of the business, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In forming this view, the directors have considered trading and cash flow forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book with customers spread across different geographic areas and industries and the net cash position.
Strategic Report Directors Governance Financial Statements Company Information ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 103 Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2015.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services.
Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities.
Revenue from the sale of actuators, gearboxes and flow control products is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the contracted shipping terms.
Revenue from service work is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed are provisional for a 12 month period.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is allocated to cash-generating units CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 104 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 1.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets i Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of five years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles acquired.
The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired are as follows: Brands and trademarks 4 to 10 years Customer relationships 2 to 7 years Product design patents 4 to 8 years Order backlog 3 months to 1 year Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less than 50 years.
Other assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 10% to 33% Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
Leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Taxation Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Strategic Report Directors Governance Financial Statements Company Information ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 105 Inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term with an original maturity less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cashflows.
Equity Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Provisions i Warranties A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
ii Contingent consideration The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash at a future date, depends on uncertain future events.
The amounts recognised in the financial statements represent a fair value estimate at the balance sheet date of the amounts expected to be paid.
Employee benefits i Pension plans Where the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, contributions are made in accordance with qualified actuaries recommendations.
In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of the plans, these are recognised in equity.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payment transactions The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork plc at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant.
Details of the scheme are given in note 25.
The fair value of the right option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity.
The right option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled.
The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers.
These awards may vest after a period of three years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met.
Details of the grants are given in note 25.
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of nonmarket performance conditions not being met.
The Overseas Profit Linked Share Plan OPLSS and the Share Incentive Plan SIP are discretionary profit linked shares schemes based on the prior year profit of the participating Rotork companies.
The value of the award to each employee is based on salary and the length of service, the value of the awards can be up to 3,600.
Shares awarded under these schemes are issued by the trustee at the cost of purchase.
The costs of providing these plans are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period to which the employee has earned the award.
iii Long term service leave The Groups net obligation in respect of long term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv Other employee benefits The Group offers a number of discretionary bonus schemes to employees around the world.
The costs of these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 106 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 1.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward exchange contracts and swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
These are the only derivative financial instruments used by the Group.
In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue contracts for trading purposes.
Forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at fair value.
Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statementimmediately.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
i Impairment of intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortised over their useful lives which are based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue.
The useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure they continue to be appropriate.
Changes to the estimates used can result in significant variations in the carrying value.
The Group assesses the impairment of intangible assets subject to amortisation whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
Additionally, goodwill arising on acquisitions and indefinite lived assets are subject to impairment review.
The Group undertakes an impairment review annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review of intangible assets include the following: Significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results: Significant changes in the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business: or Significant negative industry or economic trends.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rate and growth rates.
Explanations of the estimates, judgements and sensitivities in respect of the current year impairment review are detailed in note 10. ii Valuation of acquired intangible assets Acquisitions may result in the recognition of customer relationships, brands and trademarks, product design patents and order backlogs.
These are valued using discounted cash flow models or a relief from royalty method.
In applying these methodologies certain key judgements and assumptions are made over discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates and tax rates where a group of companies is acquired.
Further details of the accounting policies are shown earlier in this note and the valuation of the acquired intangible assets are shown in note 11. iii Valuation of inventory The Group inventory is spread across all of the Groups global locations.
The provisions made to write down slow-moving and obsolete inventory are based on an assessment of market developments and on an analysis of historic and projected usage.
The calculation of the provisions requires application of judgement by management.
iv Retirement benefits The Groups financial statements include costs in relation to, and provisions for, retirement benefit obligations.
The costs and the present value of any pension value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, salary increases, inflation, the returns that the plan assets will generate and the discount rate to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses previous experience and impartial actuarial advice to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The estimates and the effects of variances in the key estimates are shown in note 24.

The reduction in the effective tax rate from 26.9% to 26.5% is primarily due the impact of the reduction of the UK rate of corporation tax substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the USA, China, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork plc controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
The value of temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax has not been recognised is 307,714,000 2014: 292,704,000.

Goodwill 2015 2014 Cost At 1 January 149,679 105,150 Acquisition through business combinations note 3 74,460 45,054 Other movements 743 Exchange adjustments 1,310 525 At 31 December 222,086 149,679 Provision for impairment At 1 January and 31 December Carrying amounts 222,086 149,679 Other movements represents a final purchase price adjustment in respect of YTC which was acquired in 2014.
Cash generating units Goodwill acquired through business combinations have been allocated to the lowest level of cash generating unit CGU and to the division in which it is reported.
Where the acquired entitys growth into new markets is through the Groups existing sales network and or where manufacturing of certain products is transferred to other businesses within a division the lowest level of CGU is considered to be at a divisional sub-group level.
During the year Fairchild, Soldo, YTC and Midland were combined to form an Instruments sub-group.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs.
These calculations use cash flow projections from management forecasts which are based on the budget and the three year plan.
The three year plan is a bottom up process which takes place as part of the annual budget process.
Once the budget for the next financial year is finalised, years 2 and 3 of the three year plan are prepared by each reporting entitys management reflecting their view of the local market, known projects and experience of past performance.
The annual budget and the three year plan are reviewed and approved by the Board each year.
The key assumptions in the annual impairment review which are common to all CGUs are set out below: i Long term growth rates In the period after the three year plan growth rates are forecast at 5% per annum for the first two years and 2% thereafter for each CGU.
The 5% rate reflects a realistic market forecast for the flow control market up until 2020.
The continued need for our customers to improve their infrastructure by automating valves gives confidence that the growth rate of our market will exceed the long term growth rate of 2% used in the impairment calculations.
ii Discount rates The discount rates presented above are pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital WACC for each of the CGUs.
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
Strategic Report Directors Governance Financial Statements Company Information ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 115 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable change in assumptions.
Using the key assumptions above and applying sensitivities to these assumptions below, Bifold and the Instruments sub-group would be the first CGUs to trigger a potential impairment.
Apart from these there is no reasonable change that would cause the carrying amount of any other CGU goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
The Instruments sub-group downside sensitivities have been assessed.
A decrease in the growth rate by 7% in each of the next five years or an increase in the discount rate by 3% to 15.5% would result in the headroom being reduced from 44,500,000 in the base case to zero.
It is anticipated that as the acquired businesses continue to leverage the sales network opportunities from being part of the Rotork Group the long term growth rate of the CGU should comfortably exceed the growth rates assumed in the impairment review.
Bifold downside sensitivities have also been assessed.
A growth rate of 2% per annum from year three of the three year plan would result in a reduction of the headroom from 39,200,000 in the base case to zero.
It is anticipated that as Bifold continues to develop its sales of recently launched products, brings more products to market over the next couple of years and at the same time develops the sales network opportunities from being part of the Group, the growth rates will exceed the long term growth rate of 2% used in the impairment review.
The amortisation charge is recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.

Pension schemes i Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates two defined benefit pension arrangements the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme UK Scheme and the Rotork Controls Inc. Pension Plan US Pension plan.
On retirement, leaving service or death the Schemes provide benefits based on final salary and length of service.
The UK Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective and contributions to pay for future accrual of benefits.
The UK Scheme is managed by a Trustee, with directors appointed in part by the Group and part from elections by members of the Scheme.
The Trustee has responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Schemes assets.
The Trustee delegates some of these functions to its professional advisers where appropriate.
The US Pension Plan is subject to the ERISA funding requirements.
A valuation of the Plan is carried out annually to ensure the Funding Objective is met under ERISA by contributing at least the Minimum Required Contribution.
As part of this process the Company must contribute to the Plan enough contributions to ensure at least the Minimum Contribution is deposited in the Trust to pay for the accrual of benefits.
The two defined benefit pension arrangements expose the Group to a number of risks: Investment risk.
The Schemes hold investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
The Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Schemes hold assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
A significant proportion of the benefits under the Schemes are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
In the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.
There were no plan amendments, curtailments or settlements during the period.

Pension schemes continued The split of the Schemes assets were as follows: 2015 2014 Fair value Fair value Equities 75,550 71,928 Bonds 60,111 59,748 Property 9,687 8,717 Cash 137 1,403 US deposit administration contract 11,646 9,990 Total 157,131 151,786 Actual return on the Schemes assets 1,910 14,242 The mortality assumptions used are the S1NXA year of birth tables with future improvements in mortality based on the CMI 2015 projections 2014: CMI 2012 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum 2014: 1.25%.
By way of example the respective mortality tables indicate the following life expectancy: 2015 2014 Life expectancy at age 65 Life expectancy at age 65 Current age Male Female Male Female 65 22.0 24.4 22.5 25.0 45 23.7 26.4 24.2 26.9 Sensitivity analysis on the Schemes liabilities Approximate effect on Adjustments to assumptions liabilities Discount rate Plus 0.5% pa 17,300 Minus 0.5% pa 19,300 Inflation Plus 0.5% pa 8,800 Minus 0.5% pa 8,400 Salary Increase Plus 0.5% pa 3,900 Minus 0.5% pa 3,700 Life Expectancy Decrease mortality rates by a factor of 10% 5,400 Increase mortality rates by a factor of 10% 4,900 The above sensitivities are approximate and only show the likely effect of an assumption being adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same.
For the life expectancy sensitivity we have increased decreased the mortality rates by a factor of 10%.
Broadly speaking this decreases increases the assumed life expectancy by slightly less than one year.
The sensitivity analysis shown above was determined using the same method as per the calculation of liabilities for the balance sheet disclosures, but using assumptions adjusted as detailed above.
Effect of the Schemes on the Groups future cashflows The Group is required to agree a Schedule of Contributions with the Trustees of the UK Scheme following a valuation which must be carried out at least once every three years.
The next valuation of the Scheme will have an effective date of 31 March 2016.
In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than expected the Group may be required to increase contributions above those set out in the existing Schedule of Contributions.
Conversely, if the position is better than expected, contributions may be reduced.
The Group estimates that cash contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes during 2016 will be 3,029,000 for regular payments 2015: 2,900,000 and 5,500,000 of additional payments in relation to past service 2015: 5,500,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 21 years.
ii Other pension plans The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon retirement.
Total expense relating to these plans in the year was 3,703,000 2014: 3,506,000.

b Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is a performance share plan under which shares are conditionally allocated to selected members of senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the Companys AGM on 18 May 2000, awards over shares are made to executive directors and senior managers each year.
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 128 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 25.
Share-based payments continued 2010 LTIP Following shareholder approval of the 2010 LTIP at the Companys AGM on 23 April 2010, awards of shares have been made annually to executive and senior managers.
Half of these awards vest under a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition and half under an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares transferred will be determined by the number of shares initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
The actual number of shares transferred will be 25% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
The EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is RPI 10% over the vesting period up to a maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI 25%.
The performance period for the 2012 awards which ended on 31 December 2014.
The TSR element of the award did not vest as the Company was in the 40th percentile relative to the comparator group.
The EPS growth was 28.0% over the performance period which exceeded RPI by 20.4%.
Messrs. PwC LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 37.0% vesting of this award.
The performance period for the 2013 awards ended on 31 December 2015.

Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The Treasury department maintains liquidity, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk, manages relations with the Groups bankers and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 80% to 95% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set around this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of nonpayment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group maintains an allowance for impairment in respect of noninsured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance.
As well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing and liquidity of funds.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2015 2014 Trade receivables 118,801 128,472 Other receivables 15,459 14,562 Cash and cash equivalents 48,968 46,816 Foreign exchange contracts 25 1,913 183,253 191,763 Other receivables consist principally of tax receivables and prepayments.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: Carrying amount 2015 2014 Sterling 17,591 15,207 US dollar 32,800 37,750 Euro 44,579 45,014 Other 23,831 30,501 118,801 128,472 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 130 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 26.
Financial instruments continued Provisions against trade receivables The aging of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment at the reporting date was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2015 2015 2014 2014 Not past due 81,557 11 86,682 93 Past due 030 days 18,186 96 21,910 105 Past due 3160 days 10,428 38 10,363 40 Past due 6190 days 3,197 208 3,184 275 Past due more than 91 days 10,917 5,131 8,680 1,834 124,285 5,484 130,819 2,347 b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses: it also maintains a 7m overdraft facility 2014: 7m on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 1.5%.
During 2015, the Group refinanced its loan facilities.
It extended its 20,000,000 committed 364 day facility to August 2016 at LIBOR plus 0.35%, and it entered into a 90,000,000 term facility which matures in August 2018 at LIBOR plus 0.8%, and a 60,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility which matures in August 2020 at LIBOR plus 0.85%.
At year end 119,000,000 of the committed facilities were drawn, resulting in 51,000,000 being available.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2015 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 119,743 120,301 50,483 30,037 39,023 758 Finance lease liabilities 325 334 262 70 2 Trade and other payables 71,336 71,336 71,336 Contingent consideration 11,775 11,775 1,628 10,147 Foreign exchange contracts 4,032 4,032 3,601 431 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 207,251 207,818 127,310 40,685 39,025 798 Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2014 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 21,512 21,757 20,304 254 327 872 Finance lease liabilities 25 27 16 10 1 Trade and other payables 75,353 75,353 75,353 Contingent consideration 5,493 5,493 5,493 Foreign exchange contracts 1,119 1,119 1,119 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 103,542 103,789 102,285 264 328 912 Where a counterparty experiences credit stress then the foreign exchange contracts may be settled on a net basis but standard practice is to settle on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is 175,777,000 2014: 144,706,000 and the gross inflow is 172,144,000 2014: 145,566,000.
Strategic Report Directors Governance Financial Statements Company Information ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 131 c Market risk Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, and may affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the business units functional currency.
The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other nonsterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures may also be hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Groups cash management some of the overseas subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their intragroup counterparty is in the UK.
The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary so the UK holds a foreign currency current asset or liability which is usually hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps.
At the balance sheet date only the forward part of the swap remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the intercompany loan and deposit balances as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2015 was a 4,007,000 liability 2014: 794,000 asset comprising an asset of 25,000 2014: 1,913,000 and a liability of 4,032,000 2014: 1,119,000.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2015 mature in 2016 and 2017.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 235,000 2014: 325,000 and a change of one cent in the value of US dollar against sterling would have had an impact of the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 400,000 2014: 550,000.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2015 2014 2015 2014 US dollar 1.53 1.65 1.47 1.55 Euro 1.38 1.24 1.36 1.28 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 132 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 26.
Financial instruments continued ii Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling, US dollar, euro and renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2015 2014 Fixed rate financial liabilities 604 512 Floating rate financial liabilities 119,504 21,065 120,108 21,577 The fixed and floating rate financial liabilities comprise finance leases, preference shares and bank loans.
The floating rate lease obligations bear interest at rates determined by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 1.98% or 1.99% excluding the zero rate debt 2014: 1.7% or 1.9%.
The weighted average period for which non zero interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is 1.6 years.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2015 2014 In one year or less 50,352 20,274 In more than one year but not more than two years 30,084 237 In more than two years but not more than five years 38,975 267 In more than five years 697 799 Total 120,108 21,577 d Capital risk management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure it maintains sufficient capital in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group has an asset-light business model and uses cash generated from operations to either invest organically or by acquisition.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic and market conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group defines capital as net funds and equity attributable to shareholders see note 17.
There are no externally imposed restrictions on the Groups capital structure.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: i Group net debt 2015 2014 Total borrowings 120,108 21,577 Cash and cash equivalents note 16 48,968 46,816 Group net debt funds 71,140 25,239 Strategic Report Directors Governance Financial Statements Company Information ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 133 ii Return on capital employed 2015 2014 Adjusted operating profit Operating profit 104,386 142,227 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 20,886 14,940 125,272 157,167 Capital employed Shareholders funds 407,802 376,795 Cash and cash equivalents note 16 48,968 46,816 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 120,108 21,577 Net debt cash 71,140 25,239 Pension deficit net of deferred tax 17,532 27,950 496,474 379,506 Average capital employed 437,990 330,237 Return on capital employed 28.6% 47.6% e Fair values The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet, were as follows: Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value 2015 2015 2014 2014 Loans and receivables Trade receivables 118,801 118,801 128,472 128,472 Other receivables 15,459 15,459 14,562 14,562 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 48,968 48,968 46,816 46,816 Designated cash flow hedges Foreign exchange contracts: Financial assets 25 25 1,913 1,913 Financial liabilities 4,032 4,032 1,119 1,119 Financial liabilities at amortised cost Bank loans 119,743 119,743 21,512 21,512 Trade and other payables 71,336 71,336 75,353 75,353 Contingent consideration 11,775 11,775 5,493 5,493 Preference shares 40 40 40 40 Finance lease liabilities 325 325 25 25 23,998 23,998 88,221 88,221 Fair value hierarchy The fair value of the Groups outstanding derivative financial assets and liabilities consisted of foreign exchange contracts and swaps and were estimated using year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the appropriate value dates, and gains and losses are taken to equity estimated using market foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
All derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The other financial instruments are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are valued as follows: i Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
ii Contingent consideration As all the contingent consideration is contractually due for payment within 14 months 2014: 12 months, the carrying amount is equal to the fair value.
