CBRE Limited, Chartered Surveyors the Property Valuer completed a valuation of Group investment properties at 31 December 2015 on an open market basis in accordance with the requirements of the Valuation Standards issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is deemed to equate to market value one asset was valued by Knight Frank LLP.
The Property Valuer, in valuing the portfolio, is acting independently and external to it.
Market value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amount for which each asset could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 1,319,555,000 2014 1,272,315,000.
The difference between the market value and the fair value at 31 December 2015 consists of accrued income relating to the pre-payment for rent-free periods recognised over the life of the lease totalling 7,860,435 2014 7,084,000 which is separately recorded in the accounts as a current asset.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 18 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent.
of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
52 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 239795 UKCPT pp50-pp62 25 04 2016 11:00 Page 53 In addition to the above, the property portfolio market value as at 31 December 2015 is based on the following: The Estimated Net Annual Rent for each property, which is based on the current rental value of each of the properties, which reflects the terms of the leases where the property, or part of the property, are let at the date of valuation.
If the property, or parts thereof, are vacant at the date of valuation, the rental value reflects the rent the valuer considers would be obtainable on an open market letting as at the date of valuation.
The valuer has assumed that all rent reviews are to be assessed by reference to estimated rental value.
Also there is the assumption that all tenants will meet their obligations under their leases, and are responsible for insurance, payment of business rates, and all repairs, whether directly or by means of a service charge.
The valuer has not made any adjustments to reflect any liability to taxation that may arise on disposal, nor any costs associated with disposals incurred by the owner however, normal acquisition costs are included in the valuation.
The valuer assumes an initial yield in the region of 3 to 7 per cent.
for the majority of the properties, with the reversionary yield being in the region of 4 to 7 per cent.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Manager advises of the presence of such materials.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs or maintenance to its investment properties.
The following disclosure is provided in relation to the adoption of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
All properties are deemed Level 3 for the purposes of fair value measurement and the current use of each property is considered the highest and best use.
The fair value of completed investment property is determined using a yield methodology.
Under this method, a propertys fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the assets life including an exit or terminal value.
As an accepted method within the income approach to valuation, this method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest.
To this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate capitalisation rate is applied to establish the present value of the cash inflows associated with the real property.
The duration of the cash flow and the specific timing of inflows and outflows are determined by events such as rent reviews, lease renewal and related lease up periods, re-letting, redevelopment, or refurbishment.
The appropriate duration is typically driven by market behaviour that is a characteristic of the class of property.
In the case of investment properties, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy, nonrecoverable expenses, collection losses, lease incentives, maintenance cost, agent and commission costs and other operating and management expenses.
The series of periodic net cash inflows, along with an estimate of the terminal value anticipated at the end of the projection period, is then discounted.
Set out below are the valuation techniques used for each property sector plus a description and quantification of the key unobservable inputs relating to each sector.

The bank loan was secured on a proportion of the property portfolio of the Group.
Under bank covenants related to the loan the Company was to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 50 per cent.
this is defined as the ratio of the loan compared to the aggregate of the open market property valuations plus any cash deposits : The qualifying adjusted net rental income for any calculation period any 3 month period is not less than 175 per cent.
of the projected finance costs for that period: No single tenant accounts for more than 30 per cent.
of the total net rental income: The five largest tenants do not account for more than 50 per cent.
of total net rental income: No single property accounts for more than 25 per cent.
of the gross secured asset value this is defined as the sum of the value of the properties as stated in the latest valuations plus any cash deposits.
The Company met all the covenant tests during the period the Company held the loan.
Interest rate exposure was hedged by the purchase of two interest rate swap contracts.
The hedge was achieved by matching the notional amount of the swaps with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
The hedge was repaid in April 2015 when the loan was repaid.
The sum paid in relation to the swap was 361,000. ii Barclays Facility The Group also had a seven year 150 million facility which was due to mature in May 2018, with Barclays Bank plc taken out in May 2011.
In April 2015, the loan was extended out to April 2020.
As at 31 December 2015 this entire loan was drawn down.
The bank loan is secured on the property portfolio held by UKCPEL.
Under bank covenants related to the loan UKCPEL is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent.
Interest cover at the relevant payment date is not less than 160 per cent.
UKCPEL met all covenant tests during the year.
Interest rate exposure was hedged by the purchase of three interest rate swap contracts.
These swaps were repaid in April 2015 at a cost of 7.04 million and replaced by one interest rate swap.
The notional amount of the swap and the swap term matches the loan principal and the loan term.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had in place one interest rate swap totalling 150 million with Barclays bank plc 2014: 150 million.
The interest rate swap effectively hedges the current drawn down loan with Barclays Bank plc.
Interest on the swap is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 1.30per cent.
per annum on the 150 million swap.
The fair value of the asset in respect of the interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2015 is 159,000 2014: Liability of 7.5 million which is based on the marked to market value.
Interest is payable by UKCPEL at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the market value of the property portfolio in UKCPEL expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage as well as any cash generated from the sale of one of these properties.
Up until April 2015 the following rates applied: If the LTV percentage is equal to or less than 25 per cent.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 25 per cent.
and does not exceed 35 per cent.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 35 per cent.
and does not exceed 40 per cent.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 40 per cent.
and does not exceed 45 per cent.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 45 per cent.
and does not exceed 60 per cent.
Following the refinancing in April 2015 the margin was fixed at 1.5 per cent.
per annum and this was the applicable margin as at 31 December 2015 2014- 1.70per cent..
In addition to the above UKPCPEL secured a 50million revolving credit facility RCF from Barclays at a margin of 1.50 per cent.
above LIBOR available for five years but cancellable at any time.
The RCF has a non-utilisation fee of 0.6 per cent.
per annum charged on the proportion of the RCF not utilised on a pro-rata basis.
At 31 December 2015 the RCF remained unutilised.
56 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 239795 UKCPT pp50-pp62 25 04 2016 11:00 Page 57 iii Cornerstone Facility In April 2015 the Group took out a twelve year 100 million loan which is due to mature in April 2027 with Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLP, a member of the MassMutual Financial Services Group.
The loan was taken out by UK Commercial Property Finance Holdings Limited UKCFH.
The bank loan is secured on the portfolio of eight properties held within the wider Group.
Under bank covenants related to the loan UKCFH is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 75 per cent.
Interest cover at the relevant payment date and also projected over the course of the proceeding 12 months is not less than 200 per cent.
UKCFH met all covenant tests during the year.
Interest is payable by UKCFH at a fixed rate equal to the aggregate of the equivalent 12 year gilt yield, fixed at the time of drawdown and a margin.
This resulted in a fixed rate of interest payable of 3.03 per cent.
There are no interest rate swaps in place relating to this facility.
Swap Instruments As at 31 December 2015 the Group had in place an interest rate swap instrument totalling 150 million which was deemed to be an effective hedge as per note 1 q.
The revaluation of this swap at the year end resulted in a gain on interest rate swaps of 1.0 million 2014: loss 1.3 million.
Of the total gain arising on interest rate swaps, 1.0 million related to effective hedge instruments 2014: loss 1.3 million which is credited through Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The valuation techniques applied to fair value the derivatives include the swap models including the CVA DVA swap models, using present value calculations.
The model incorporates various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and forward rates.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2015 amounted to an asset of 159,000 2014: Liability of 8.3 million.
Based on current yield curves and non-performance risk, 2.9 million of this value is a liability which relates to the next 12 months and is therefore classified as a current liability.
The remainder is classified as a long term asset.

Financial Instruments and Investment Properties The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
The Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations and loan facilities and swap instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
Fair value hierarchy The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of investment properties recognised in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy: 31 December 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Investment properties - - 1,311,695 1,311,695 31 December 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Investment properties - - 1,265,231 1,265,231 The lowest level of input is the underlying yield on each property which is an input not based on observable market data.

Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of investment properties is calculated using unobservable inputs as described in note 8.
The fair value of the derivative interest rate swap contract is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument.
The fair value of the bank loans are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using the current interest rates applicable to each loan.
Real Estate Risk The Group has identified the following risks associated with the real estate portfolio: The cost of any development schemes may increase if there are delays in the planning process.
The Group uses advisers who are experts in the specific planning requirements in the schemes location in order to reduce the risks that may arise in the planning process: A major tenant may become insolvent causing a significant loss of rental income and a reduction in the value of the associated property see also credit risk below.
To reduce this risk, the Group reviews the financial status of all prospective tenants and decides on the appropriate level of security required via rental deposits or guarantees: The exposure of the fair values of the portfolio to market and occupier fundamentals such as tenants financial position.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 59 239795 UKCPT pp50-pp62 25 04 2016 11:00 Page 60 Notes to the Accounts continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2015 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 75,786 - - 75,786 Rent receivable 1,163 - - 1,163 Other debtors 2,356 - - 2,356 79,305 - - 79,305 Financial Assets 2014 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 63,379 - - 63,379 Rent receivable 960 - - 960 Other debtors 2,232 - - 2,232 66,571 - - 66,571 In the event of default by a tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Investment Manager monitors such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2015 is 1,163,00 2014: 960,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 2,323,000 2014: 1,891,000 as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
All tenant deposits are in line with market practice.
There is no residual credit risk associated with the financial assets of the Group.
Other than those included in the provision for bad debts, no financial assets past due are impaired.
All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
55.4 million 2014: 41.2 million of the year end cash balance is held in the Standard Life Investments Liquidity Fund, which is a money market fund and has a triple A rating.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of a financial institution may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Investment Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution subject to restrictions under the loan facility.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
While commercial properties are not immediately realisable, the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Investment Manager investing in a diversified portfolio of prime real estate and placing cash in liquid deposits and accounts.
This is monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups bank loan entitles the lender to require early repayment, and in such circumstances the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
60 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 239795 UKCPT pp50-pp62 25 04 2016 11:00 Page 61 At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups liabilities was: Financial Liabilities 2015 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 1,803 5,423 292,390 299,616 Other creditors 22,324 - - 22,324 24,127 5,423 292,390 321,940 Financial Liabilities 2014 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 2,234 85,296 164,769 252,299 Other creditors 22,386 - - 22,386 24,620 85,296 164,769 274,685 The amounts in the table are based on contractual undiscounted payments.
Interest rate risk The cash balance as shown in the Balance Sheet, is its carrying amount and has a maturity of less than one year.
Interest is receivable on cash at a variable rate ranging from 0.2 per cent.
at the year end and deposits are re-priced at intervals of less than one year.

would have reduced the reported profit by 758,000 2014: decreased the reported profit by 634,000.
The effect on equity is nil excluding the impact of a charge in retained earnings as a result of a change in net profit.
As the Groups bank loans have been hedged by interest rate swaps or are at fixed rates, these loans are not subject to interest rate risk.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had in place a total of 150 million of interest rate swap instruments 2014: 230 million.
The values of these instruments are marked to market and will change if interest rates change.
It is estimated that an increase of 1 per cent.
in interest rates would result in the swap asset increasing by 6.0 million 2014: 5.2 million which would increase the reported other comprehensive income by the same amount.
in interest rates would result in the swap asset decreasing by 6.3 million 2014: 5.2 million which would decrease the reported other comprehensive income by the same amount.
The other financial assets and liabilities of Group are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Foreign Currency Risk There was no foreign currency risk as at 31 December 2015 or 31 December 2014 as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds Sterling.
Capital Management Policies The Group considers that capital comprises issued ordinary shares, net of shares held in treasury, and long-term borrowings.

UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 61 239795 UKCPT pp50-pp62 25 04 2016 11:00 Page 62 Notes to the Accounts continued The Group monitors capital primarily through regular financial reporting and also through a gearing policy.
Gearing is defined as gross borrowings divided by total assets less current liabilities.
The Groups gearing policy is set out in the Investment Policy section of the Report of the Directors.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements but does have banking covenants on which it monitors and reports on a quarterly basis.
Included in these covenants are requirements to monitor loan to value ratios which is calculated as the amount of outstanding debt divided by the market value of the properties secured.
The Groups Loan to value ratio is shown below.
The Group did not breach any of its loan covenants, nor did it default on any other of its obligations under its loan arrangements in the year to 31 December 2015.

of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of annualised total rental value was 2.8 per cent.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
