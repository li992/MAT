The fair value of the unquoted investments held by the Company are based on the published NAV of the underlying investments in AllBlue Limited and AllBlue Leveraged Feeder Limited.
Following the announcement from BlueCrest on 1 December 2015 that AllBlue Limited and AllBlue Leveraged Fund Limited were closed to redemptions, the unquoted financial assets transferred from level 2 to level 3, on the basis that the NAV is no longer observable due to the return of capital programme see Note 16.
In the prior year the significant input to the fair value was observable and no significant unobservable adjustments were made to the valuations and so the Company categorised all the unquoted investments as Level 2.
The quoted investments held by the Company, the ICS Funds, are in an active market with a directly observable price.
The Company therefore classifies the investment as Level 1 in accordance with the fair value hierarchy.
Details of the value of the classifications are listed in the table below.
Values are based on the fair value of the investments as at the reporting date: Fair Value as at Fair Value as at 31 Dec 2015 31 Dec 2014 GBP GBP Level 1 47,841,642 1,176,874 Level 2 - 773,542,038 Level 3 742,840,902 - Level 3 reconciliation The following table shows a reconciliation of all movements in the fair value of investments categorised within Level 3 between the beginning and the end of the reporting period: 2015 2014 GBP GBP Balance at beginning of year - - Transfer from Level 2 742,840,902 - Balance at end of year 742,840,902 - Page 66 v. 2.7
