A customers credit risk profile and ability to afford the proposed contract is initially evaluated both at the point of application, and subsequently should the customer fall into arrears.
A scorecard based on historic payment patterns of customers is used to assess the applicants potential default risk.
The scorecard incorporates data from the applicant, such as income and employment, and data from an external credit bureau.
The application assessment process involves verification of key aspects of the customer data.
Certain policy rules including customer age, proposed loan size and vehicle type are also assessed in the decisioning process, as well as affordability checks to ensure that, at the time of application, the customer can afford the loan repayments.
Arrears management is conducted by way of a combination of letters, inbound and outbound telephony, SMS, email and outsourced debt collection agency activities.
Contact is made with the customer to discuss the reasons for non-payment and specific strategies are employed to support the customer in returning to a good standing and retaining use of the vehicle.
These include appropriate forbearance arrangements, or where the contract has become unsustainable for the customer then an appropriate exit strategy is implemented.
ii Bank counterparties The groups maximum exposure to credit risk on bank counterparties as at 31 December 2015 was 32.4m 2014: 12.1m.
Counterparty credit risk arises as a result of cash deposits placed with banks and the use of derivative financial instruments with banks andother financial institutions which are used to hedge interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.
Counterparty credit risk is managed by the groups treasury committee and is governed by a board-approved counterparty policy which ensures that the groups cash deposits and derivative financial instruments are only made with high-quality counterparties with the level of permitted exposure to a counterparty firmly linked to the strength of its credit rating.
In addition, there is a maximum exposure limit for all institutions, regardless of credit rating.
This is linked to the groups regulatory capital base in line with the groups regulatory reporting requirements on large exposures to the PRA.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will have insufficient liquid resources available to fulfil its operational plans and or to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by the groups centralised treasury department through daily monitoring of expected cash flows in accordance with aboard-approved group funding and liquidity policy.
This process is monitored regularly by the treasury committee.
The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The group therefore maintains headroom on its committed borrowing facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months, after assuming that Vanquis Bank will fully funded itself through retail deposits and repay its intercompany loan from Provident Financial plc.
As at 31 December 2015, the groups committed borrowing facilities had a weighted average period to maturity of 2.6 years 2014: 3.1 years and the headroom on these committed facilities amounted to 222.3m 2014: 111.5m.
The group is less exposed than other mainstream lenders to liquidity risk as the loans issued by the home credit business are of short-term duration typically around one year, whereas the groups borrowings extend over a number of years.
As a PRA-regulated institution, Vanquis Bank is required to maintain a liquid assets buffer, and other liquid resources, in order to ensure that ithas sufficient liquid resources to fulfil its operational plans and meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
As at 31 December 2015, the liquid assets buffer, including other liquidity resources, held by Vanquis Bank amounted to 134.2m 2014: 121.4m.
In addition, from 1 October 2015 with a transitional period extending to 1 January 2018, the group and Vanquis Bank have been required tomeet the liquidity coverage ratio LCR.
The LCR requires institutions to match net liquidity outflows during a 30-day period with a buffer ofhigh quality liquid assets.
The group and Vanquis Bank developed systems and controls to monitor and forecast the LCR and have been submitting regulatory reports on the ratio since 1 January 2014.
Both the group and Vanquis Bank continue to meet the LCR requirements.
A maturity analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows of the groups bank and other borrowings, including derivative financial instruments settled on a net and gross basis, is shown below.
Financial statements 147 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial risk management continued The table below shows the future cash payable under current drawings.
This reflects both the interest payable and the repayment of the borrowing on maturity.
Due to the seasonal nature of the home credit business, drawings under the groups revolving bank facilities are typically drawn for only three months at any time despite having the ability to draw the borrowings for much longer under the committed borrowing facility.
In the table below, the cash flows of borrowings made under the groups syndicated revolving bank facility are required to be shown as being due within one year, despite the group having the ability to redraw these amounts until the contractual maturity of the underlying facility in May 2018.

The groups exposure to movements in interest rates is managed by the treasury committee and is governed by a board-approved interest rate hedging policy which forms part of the groups treasury policies.
The group seeks to limit the net exposure to changes in interest rates.
This is achieved through a combination of issuing fixed-rate debt andbythe use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
A 2% movement in the interest rate applied to borrowings during 2015 and 2014 would not have had a material impact on the groups profit before taxation or equity as the groups interest rate risk was substantially hedged.
d Foreign exchange rate risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk of a change in foreign currency exchange rates leading to a reduction in profits or equity.
The groups exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates is monitored monthly by the treasury committee and is governed by a boardapproved foreign exchange rate risk management policy which forms part of the groups treasury policies.
The groups exposures to foreign exchange rate risk during 2015 arose from: i the home credit operations in the Republic of Ireland which are hedged by matching euro-denominated net assets with euro-denominated borrowings or forward contracts as closely as practicable: ii the Vanquis Bank pilot operations in Poland, which was hedged by matching zloty-denominated net assets with zloty-denominated borrowings or forward contracts as closely as practicable: and iii the available for sale investment related to Vanquis Banks interest in Visa Europe which consists of upfront euro cash consideration, which has been hedged subsequent to the year end through matching the cash consideration with euro-denominated borrowings, and deferred consideration of preferred stock which is convertible into US dollar-denominated Class A common stock of Visa Inc on completion of the transaction.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of the valuation and timing of completion, the valuation of the common stock is not hedged.
As at 31 December 2015, a 2% movement in the sterling to euro exchange rate would have led to a 1.1m 2014: 1.1m movement in customer receivables with an opposite movement of 1.1m 2014: 1.1m in external borrowings.
Due to the natural hedging of matching eurodenominated assets with euro-denominated liabilities, there would have been a minimal impact on reported profits and equity 2014: nil.
As at 31 December 2015, a 2% movement in the sterling to euro exchange rate would have led to a 0.3m 2014: nil movement in the available for sale investment and a 0.3m impact on reported profits and equity 2014: nil.
A hedge matching the asset with euro-denominated borrowings was put in place subsequent to the year-end, which would have reduced the impact to a 0.2m 2014: nil movement in external borrowings and a 0.1m impact on reported profits and equity 2014: nil related to the unhedged deferred consideration.
As at 31 December 2015, a 2% movement in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate would have led to a 0.1m 2014: nil movement in the available for sale investment.
Due to the US dollar element relating to the unhedged deferred consideration, there would have been a 0.1m 2014: nil impact on reported profits and equity 2014: nil.
As at 31 December 2015, a 2% movement in the sterling to zloty exchange rate would have led to a nil 2014: 0.3m movement in customer receivables with an opposite movement of nil 2014: 0.3m in the borrowings.
Due to the net investment hedge in place, there would have been no impact on reported profits or equity in 2015 2014: nil.
The cumulative foreign exchange differences which have been recognised within other comprehensive income will be recycled to the income statement on liquidation of the Vanquis Bank pilot operation in Poland.
e Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse market movements caused by active trading positions taken in interest rates, foreign exchange markets, bonds and equities.
The groups corporate policies do not permit it to undertake position taking or trading books of this type and therefore it does not do so.
Financial statements 149 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Capital risk management The groups objective in respect of capital risk management is to maintain an efficient capital structure whilst satisfying the requirements of the groups banking covenants and the regulatory capital requirements set by the PRA.
The group primarily manages its capital base against two measures as described below: a Gearing In order to maintain an efficient capital structure, the group has a maximum target gearing ratio of 3.5 times.
This provides a comfortable level of headroom against the groups banking covenant of 5.0 times and regulatory capital requirements.
The maximum target gearing ratio of 3.5times is fully aligned with the groups target of distributing 80% of post-tax earnings by way of dividends whilst retaining sufficient capital tosupport receivables growth consistent with managements medium-term growth plans for the group.
As at 31 December 2015, the gearing ratio stood at 2.2 times 2014: 2.4 times, calculated as follows: 2015 2014 Group Note m m Borrowings 23 1,596.2 1,493.0 Arrangement fees 23 6.7 7.5 Liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources 22 134.2 121.4 Borrowings for gearing purposes 1,468.7 1,379.1 Shareholders equity 707.7 613.0 Pension asset 20 62.3 56.0 Deferred tax on pension asset 11.2 11.2 Hedging reserve 27 0.5 3.3 Equity for gearing purposes 657.1 571.5 Gearing times 2.2 2.4 The gearing ratio is lower than the maximum target of 3.5 times due to: i the groups strong capital generation over the last two years, particularly as a result of the capital released from the reduction in the receivables book of the Provident home credit business over that period: and ii the equity raised to fund the acquisition of Moneybarn in August 2014 in order to preserve regulatory capital.
b Regulatory capital The group is the subject of consolidated supervision by the PRA.
As part of this supervision, it is required to maintain a certain level of regulatory capital known as its Individual Capital Guidance ICG in order to mitigate against unexpected losses.
The ICG remains confidential between the PRA and the relevant institution and should not be publicly disclosed.
The group has complied with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD IV since 1 January 2014.
Regulatory capital differs from the groups shareholders equity included in the balance sheet as it excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the groups pension asset, net of deferred tax, the fair value of derivative financial instruments, and the proposed dividend, but includes the groups subordinated loan notes.
A reconciliation of the groups equity to regulatory capital in accordance with CRD IV, is set out below: 2015 2014 Group Note m m Shareholders equity 707.7 613.0 Other intangible assets 12 85.2 84.3 Goodwill 11 71.2 71.2 Deferred tax on acquired intangible asset 11.7 14.2 Pension asset 20 62.3 56.0 Deferred tax on pension asset 11.2 11.2 Hedging reserve 27 0.5 3.3 Dividend accrued on profits recognised 117.0 91.6 Tier 1 capital 395.4 338.6 Tier 2 capital subordinated loan notes 0.5 Total regulatory capital held 395.4 339.1 The treasury committee is responsible for monitoring the level of regulatory capital.
The level of surplus regulatory capital against the ICG is reported to the board on a monthly basis in the groups management accounts.
The group regularly forecasts regulatory capital requirements as part of the budgeting and strategic planning process.
The group is required to report quarterly to the PRA on the level of regulatory capital itholds.
As at 31 December 2015, the groups total regulatory capital was comfortably in excess of the ICG set by the PRA.
