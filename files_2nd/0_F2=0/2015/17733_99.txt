i Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2015.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Market values have been used to determine fair values.

In accordance with IFRS 13, interest rate swaps are considered to be level 2 with fair value being calculated at the present value of estimated future cash ows using market interest rates.
Forward foreign currency contracts and currency options are considered to be level 1 as the valuation is based on quoted market prices attheend of the reporting period.
Current borrowings and overdrafts short-term deposits The fair value of short-term deposits and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturityofthese instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of non-current borrowings, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet.

The charge against profit is the amount of contributions payable to the dened contribution pension schemes in respect of the accounting period.
The pension cost attributable to overseas employees for 2015 was 8 million 2014: 9 million.
United Kingdom The Group operates pension schemes for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, dened benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the Directors of Aggreko Pension Scheme Trustee Limited.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.

A6 Pensions continued The Trustee of the Scheme has control over the operation, funding and investment strategy of the Scheme but works closely with the Company toagree funding and investment strategy.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2014 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets were taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 3.6% Growth in average pay levels 4.8% Increase in pensions 3.2% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 92 million which was sufficient to cover 92% of the benets that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
As part of the valuation at 31 December 2014, the Company and the trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
Company contributions for benets building up in the future increased from 35.9% to 41.0% on 1 February 2016.
To address the Scheme deficit the Company has already made an additional contribution of 1.25 million in January 2015 and plans to make further additional contributions of1.25 million each year until 2022.
Employee contributions are 6% of pensionable earnings.
The Scheme closed to all new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
New employees are given the option to join a dened contribution scheme.
Contributions of 2 million were paid to the scheme during the year 2014: 2 million.
There are no outstanding or prepaid balances atthe year end.
An update of the Scheme was carried out by a qualied independent actuary using the latest available information for the purposes of this statement.
The major assumptions used in this update by the actuary were: 31 Dec 31 Dec 2015 2014 Rate of increase in salaries 4.9% 4.8% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.3% 3.2% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.4% 3.3% Discount rate 3.9% 3.8% Ination assumption 3.4% 3.3% Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years Men 24.0 24.0 Women 26.7 26.6 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years Men 26.7 26.7 Women 29.4 29.4 The assets in the Scheme were: Value at Value at Value at 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2015 2014 2013 Equities million million million UK Equities 8 88 Overseas Equities 12 11 10 Diversied Growth 7 77 Absolute Return 8 77 Property 14 Index-linked Bonds 37 34 22 Fixed interest Bonds 56 Bonds 17 16 13 Cash 1 21 Total 90 91 78 There is a risk of asset volatility leading to a deficit in the Scheme.
Working with the Company, the Trustee has agreed investment derisking triggers which, when certain criteria are met, will decrease corporate bond and xed interest gilt holdings and increase the holding of index linked bonds.
Over time, this will result in an investment portfolio which better matches the liabilities of the Scheme thereby reducing the risk of asset volatility.
However, there remains asignicant level of investment mismatch in the Scheme.
This is deliberate and is aimed at maximising the Schemes long-term investment return whilst retaining adequate control of the funding risks.

A6 Pensions continued The amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the Scheme are as follows: 2015 2014 2013 million million million Fair value of assets 90 91 78 Present value of funded obligations 92 98 84 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 2 7 6 An alternative method of valuation is the estimated cost of buying out benets at 31 December 2015 with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 rather than the Company continuing to fundthe ongoing liabilities of the Scheme.
The Company estimates the amount required to settle the Schemes liabilities at 31 December 2015 isaround 137 million which gives aScheme shortfall on a buyout basis of approximately 47 million.
The components of the dened benefit cost as follows: 2015 2014 million million Current service costs 2 2 Net interest cost Interest expense on liabilities 4 4 Interest income on assets 4 4 Administrative expenses and taxes 2 2 The majority of the 2 million cost was included within administrative expenses in the income statement.

A6 Pensions continued The measurement of the dened benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions as described below: The discount rate has been selected following actuarial advice and taking into account the duration of the liabilities.
A decrease in the discount rate of 0.5%per annum would result in a 14 million increase in the present value of the dened benefit obligation.
The weighted average duration of the dened benefit obligation liabilities is around 28 years.
The ination assumption adopted is consistent with the discount rate used.
It is used to set the assumptions for pension increases, salary increases and deferred revaluations.
An increase in the ination rate of 0.5% per annum would result in a 13 million increase in the present value ofthe dened benefit obligation.
The longevity assumptions adopted are based on those recommended by the Scheme Actuary advising the Trustee of the Scheme and reect the most recent mortality information available at the time of the Trustee actuarial valuation.
The increase in the present value of the dened benefit obligation due to members living one year longer would be 3 million.
There is a risk that changes in the above assumptions could increase the deficit in the Scheme.
Other assumptions used to value the dened benefit obligation are also uncertain, although their effect is less material.
Present value of Scheme assets are as follows: 2015 2014 million million Fair value of Scheme assets at 1 January 91 78 Interest income 4 4 Employer contributions 3 4 Benets paid 5 1 Remeasurements return on plan assets excluding interest income 3 6 Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 90 91 Analysis of the movement in the balance sheet 2015 2014 million million At 1 January 7 6 Dened benefit cost included in income statement 2 2 Contributions 3 4 Benets paid Total remeasurements 4 3 At 31 December 2 7 Cumulative actuarial gains and losses recognised in equity 2015 2014 million million At 1 January 38 35 Actuarial losses recognised in the year 4 3 At 31 December 34 38 The actual return on Scheme assets was nil million 2014: 11 million.
