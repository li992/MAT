Pets at Home Group Plc 116 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes forming part of the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Summary of impact of Group restructuring and Initial Public Offering On 17 March 2014, the entire issued share capital of the Company was admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List maintained by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plcs main market for listed securities Listing or IPO.
In preparation for the Companys IPO the Group was restructured.
For the consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared under IFRS, the principles of reverse acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 Business Combinations have been applied for the comparative period ended 27 March 2014.
The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of Pets at Home Group Plc being inserted as the new holding company of the Group above Pets at Home Lux S. a. r. l PAH Lux.
Holders of shares and Preferred Equity Certificates PECs in PAH Lux exchanged their PAH Lux shares and a portion of their PECs, for shares in Plc.
PAH Lux was transferred out of the Group following Listing.
By applying the principles of reverse acquisition accounting, the Group is presented as if the Company has always owned PAH Lux and the Groups subsidiaries.
The comparative consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium and merger reserve of Plc as if it had always existed, adjusted for movements in the underlying PAH Lux share capital and reserves until the exchange of PAH Lux share capital and PECs for Plc shares.
Full details of the reverse acquisition accounting applied were described in the financial statements for the 52 week period ended 27 March 2014.
1.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value, and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
New standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC becoming effective during the year have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
1.2 Measurement convention The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.3 Going concern The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report.
The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officers review.
In addition, note 21 to the financial statements include the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and prepares detailed business plans that model headroom on financial covenants.
The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
1.4 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 117 Investment in veterinary practices The Group has a number of non-participatory shareholdings in veterinary practice companies, which are accounted for as joint venture arrangements.
The veterinary practices were established under terms that require mutual agreement between the Group and the joint venture partner, and that do not give the Group power over decision making to affect its exposure to, or the extent of, the returns from its involvement with the practices and therefore are not consolidated in these financial statements.
Further, the Group is not entitled to profit, losses, or any surplus on winding up or disposal of the veterinary practices, and as such no participatory interest is recognised.
1.5 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation that is effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be.
Functional currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Companys functional currency and have been rounded to the nearest thousand.
1.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company or Group as the case may be to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company or Group : and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
1.7 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
Pets at Home Group Plc 118 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
1.8 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see below.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
1.9 Intra-Group financial instruments Financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of companies within the Group are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such.
In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that a payment will be required under the guarantee.
1.10 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold property 50 years Motor vehicles 3 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 310 years Leasehold improvements the term of the lease Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 119 1.11 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010 For acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
On a  basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010 date of adoption of IFRSs IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs for first time adopters.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost.
1.12 Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
1.13 Intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer Software 37 years 1.14 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition, less rebates and discounts.

Significant accounting policies continued 1.15 Impairment excluding inventories, and deferred tax assets Financial assets including receivables A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets the cash-generating unit.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, or CGU.
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.16 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payments A number of employees of the Companys subsidiaries including Directors receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
Share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based on a binomial model.
In valuing share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Pets at Home Group Plc market conditions.
Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 121 The cost of share based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of a share based payment award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of the modification.
Where a share based payment award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
1.17 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.18 Revenue and cost of sales Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods and services, net of discounts and excluding value added tax, sold in the ordinary course of business, and arises from activities in the United Kingdom.
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is reasonable certainty over recovery of the consideration and the amount of revenue, associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably.
Revenue is recognised when transactions are completed in store or online.
Sale of goods in store and online Retail revenue from the sale of goods is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Sale of goods represents food and accessories sold in store and online, with revenue recognised at the point of sale.
Provision of services Revenue from the provision of services is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Provision of services represents veterinary group income, grooming revenue, and insurance commissions, with revenue recognised upon provision of the service.
i Veterinary group income Veterinary group income represents revenue from the provision of veterinary services, and income from the provision of veterinary administrative support services.
Revenue received for the provision of veterinary services is recognised at the point of provision of the service and is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Fee income received from the joint venture veterinary practice companies for administrative support services is recognised in the period the services relate to and recorded net of value added tax.
ii VIP loyalty scheme Under the VIP loyalty scheme, points are earned by customers upon the purchase of goods and services.
These points can be converted by nominated charities into gift cards for redemption against goods and services in store and online.
The sales value of the points earned under the VIP scheme are treated as deferred income: the sales are only recognised once the points have been redeemed by the charities.
iii Grooming revenue Grooming revenue is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers, at the point of provision of the service.
Cost of sales Cost of sales includes costs of goods sold and other directly attributable costs and promotional income received from suppliers, including costs to deliver business services to joint venture veterinary practices and costs to deliver grooming services.
Exceptional items Income or costs that are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, are referred to as exceptional items.
These are included and separately identified within their relevant income statement category.
Pets at Home Group Plc 122 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Supplier income A number of different types of supplier income are negotiated with suppliers via the joint business planning process, in connection with the purchase of goods for resale.
The supplier income arrangements typically are not co-terminus with the Groups financial period, instead running alongside the calendar year.
Such income is only recognised when there is reasonable certainty that the conditions for recognition have been met by the Group, and the income can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract.
This income is recognised as a credit within gross margin and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory.
Supplier income comprises three main elements: 1.
Fixed percentage based income: These relate largely to volumetric rebates based on the joint business plan agreements with suppliers.
The income accrued is based on the Groups latest forecast volumes and the latest contract agreed with the supplier.
Income is not recognised until the Group has reasonable certainty that the joint business agreement will be fulfilled, with the amount of income accrued regularly re-assessed and re-measured throughout the contractual period, based on actual performance against the joint business plan.
Fixed lump sum income: These are typically guaranteed lump sum payments made by the supplier and are not based on volume.
Fixed lump sum income is usually predicated on confirmation of a supplier contract and typically includes performance conditions upon the Group, such as marketing and promotional campaigns.
These amounts are recognised periodically based on the most recent assessment of contractual performance.
Growth income: These are tiered volumetric rebates relating to growth targets agreed with the supplier in the joint business planning process.
These are retrospective rebates based on sales volumes or purchased volumes.
Income is recognised to the extent that it is reasonably certain that the conditions will be achieved, with such certainty increasing in the latter part of the calendar year.
Supplier income is recognised on an accruals basis, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.
The accrued incentives, rebates and discounts receivable at year end are included within trade and other receivables.
1.19 Expenses Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Financing income and expenses Financing expenses comprise interest payable under the effective interest rate method, incorporating amortisation of loan arrangement fees, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement see foreign currency accounting policy.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Other payables Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent free periods.
Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the lease is met, and credited to selling and distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from access date.
Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent free periods received from landlords are initially recognised as a liability on the balance sheet, which is then credited to the selling and distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement over the life of the lease.
The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling and distribution expenses on a straight-line basis from property access date to the end of the lease.
Rent-free periods are not discounted.
1.20 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 123 Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
1.21 Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments European Union effective date 1 January 2018.

Sale or Contribution of Assets between and Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 European Union effective date 1 January 2016.
1.22 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning the future that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These judgements are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge at the time and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
Carrying value of inventories The managers review the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure inventory is recorded in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any provision for impairment is recorded against the carrying value of inventories.
The managers use their knowledge of market conditions to assess future demand for the Groups products and achievable selling prices.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of CGUs as well as further information about the assumptions made are disclosed in note 10.
Assumptions relating to tax The Group recognises expected assets for tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes receivable, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items.
Where the actual asset arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax assets in the period when such determination is made.
Pets at Home Group Plc 124 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions have been made for dilapidations and for closed stores.
Information about provisions and contingencies, which are considered to have a risk of material adjustment in the next financial period due to the assumptions and estimations used, are disclosed in note 19.
The provisions are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge at the time and are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.
1.23 Dividends Final dividends are recognised in the Groups financial statements as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders such that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend.
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Segmental reporting The Directors consider there to be one operating and reportable segment, being that of the sale of pet products and services through retail outlets and the Groups websites.
The Groups Board receives monthly financial information at this level and uses this information to monitor the performance of the store portfolio, allocate resources and make operational decisions.
The internal reporting received focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify individual segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segment.

The effective tax rate before exceptional items for the 52 weeks to 26 March 2015 was 22%.
The principal reason for the difference in rate relates to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on some capital expenditure.
The exceptional tax credit of 4.3m included within the non-recurring exceptional items represents the release of a provision following agreement with HMRC in respect of interest on debt associated with the pre IPO structure.
As part of the IPO process this debt was repaid.
Overall this results in a total effective tax rate for the period of 17%.

The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below: At 26 March At 27 March 2015 2014 Period on which management approved forecasts are based years 3 3 Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 3% 3% Discount rate pre-tax 9% 8% The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and the recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use a pre-tax cash flow projection based on a 3 year plan approved by the Board.
The key assumptions in this business plan are like for like sales growth, gross and operating profit margins.
The forecast assumptions reflect continual innovation, our deep understanding of our customers and a detailed analysis of geographic opportunities that allow us to continue to grow.
The projections are based on all available information and growth rates do not exceed growth rates achieved in prior periods.
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years depending on changes in the macro-economic environment.
The discount rate was estimated based on past experience and industry average weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have assumed a growth rate projection beyond the 3 year period based on inflationary increases.
The total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill for the CGU group as assessed by the managers using the above assumptions is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been booked in each period.
The Directors consider that it is not reasonably possible for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate the excess.

Financial instruments Financial risk management The Pets at Home Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management framework Risk management in respect of financial risk is carried out by the Pets at Home Group Treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board provides written principals, through its Group Treasury Policy, for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
The main objectives of the Pets at Home Group Treasury department are: To ensure shareholder and management expectations are managed on cash flow and earnings volatility resulting from financial market movements To protect the expected cash flow and earnings from interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations to within parameters acceptable to the Board and shareholders To control banking costs and service levels Market risk i Foreign currency risk The Pets at Home Group sources a significant level of purchases in foreign currency, in excess of $50 million US dollars each financial year, and monitors its foreign currency requirements through short, medium and long term cash forecasting.
The value of purchases in US dollars has increased significantly over the last three years and the risk management policy has changed in line with this increased risk.
At 26 March 2015, the Pets at Home Groups policy is to hedge between 75% and 90% of the forecasted foreign exchange transactions on a rolling 10 to 12 month basis, using foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The transactions are deemed to be highly probable and are based on historical knowledge and forecasted purchase and sales projections.
Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 139 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows.
This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments, except for derivatives which are based on notional amounts.
The Company does not have exposure to foreign currency risk.

This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant.

ii Interest rate risk Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Pets at Home Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
As at 26 March 2015 the Group had a drawn down senior facility with a face value totalling 325.0m and an undrawn revolving credit facility of 29.6m, which expires on 17 March 2019.
The Pets at Home Groups borrowings as at 26 March 2015 incur interest at varying rates between 2.00% and 2.25% plus LIBOR, which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The analysis of loan repayments is detailed in note 17.
The Pets at Home Groups policy, with regard to interest rate risk, is to hedge the appropriate level of borrowings by entering into fixed rate agreements.
The Pets at Home Group has entered into fixed rate interest rate swap agreements over a total of 239.8m of the senior facility borrowings at the balance sheet date at a fixed rate of 0.74%, and a further fixed rate interest rate swap was taken out over a total of 77.1m at the balance sheet date at a fixed rate of 0.655%.

Pets at Home Group policy is to hedge at least 70% of the loan to ensure a fixed rate.
Therefore, designated above is the portion of the loan hedged by a fixed rate interest rate swap and the remaining un-hedged portion is designated as variable rate.
Sensitivity analysis A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the period end date would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element of interest rate swaps.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for comparative period.

Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group ensures that the banks used for the financing of the loan facilities and interest rate swap agreements held an acceptable risk rating by independent parties.
The Group has in place certain guarantees over the bank loans taken out by a number of veterinary practice companies in which it holds an investment.
Further details of these guarantees are disclosed in note 25.
The performance of the veterinary practice companies is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Exposure to credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk being the carrying amount of financial assets is summarised in the table within the fair values section below.
Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 141 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Management prepares and monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups cash balances based on expected cash flows to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there is no risk or breach which would lead to an Event of Default and compliance certificates are issued as required to the syndicate agent.

Trade and other payables and receivables The fair value of these items are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as not material.
Cash and cash equivalents The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.
Where it is not repayable on demand such as term deposits, then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Long-term and short-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates its carrying value as it has an interest rate based on LIBOR.
Short-term deposits The fair value of short term deposits is considered to be the carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest rate is reset to market rates.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange contracts are calculated by management based on external valuations received from the Groups bankers and is based on forward exchange rates and anticipated future interest yield respectively.

Financial instruments continued Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital, which is deemed to be total equity plus total debt, are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to maintain a strong credit rating and headroom on financial covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
During the period the Group fide-levered as part of the Initial Public Offering process, which brought the Groups leverage into a position commensurate with the public market.
The funding requirements of the Group are met by the utilisation of external borrowings together with available cash, as detailed in note 17.
A key objective of the Groups capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the senior loan agreement and to maintain comfortable headroom over and above these requirements.
Management have continued to measure and monitor covenant compliance throughout the period and the Group has complied with the requirements set.

The performance conditions are as follows: 75% of the Matching Award will be subject to the CAGR in the Companys earnings per share EPS over three financial years, namely FY15, FY16 and FY17 together the Performance Period which, for the avoidance of doubt, ends on 31 March 2017.
If the CAGR in the Companys EPS is 10%, then 10% of the total Matching Award will vest.
If the CAGR in the Companys EPS is 17.5% or more, then 75% of the total Matching Award will vest.
Vesting will be on a straight line basis between these two points.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the CAGR in EPS is less than 10% over the Performance Period then the amount of the Matching Award which will vest under this EPS performance condition will be nil.
25% of the total Matching Award will be subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR as compared to the UK General Retail Index over the Performance Period.
Vesting of 6.25% of the total Matching Award will occur for median performance.
Vesting of the maximum 25% of the total Matching Award will occur for upper quartile performance or above.
Vesting will occur on a straight line basis between these two points.
If the Companys TSR performance over the Performance Period is below median, then the amount of the Matching Award which will vest under this TSR performance condition will be nil.

SAYE On 25 February 2014, the Company adopted the SAYE which was registered with and self-certified with HMRC on 4 April 2015.
The rules of the SAYE were adopted pursuant to Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003 and provide for the grant of tax approved options.
On the 9 September, the Company issued invitations under the rules of the SAYE which provides eligible colleagues with an opportunity to receive share options at a 20% discount to the market price.
The maximum monthly savings was 250 per month.
The Executive Directors elected to participate in the Sharesave, along with 30% of eligible colleagues.
The Options were granted on 8 October 2014 and they are, in normal circumstances, not exercisable until completion of a 3 years savings period, beginning on 1 December 2014 and will then be exercisable for a period of 6 months.
The exercise period will, therefore, in normal circumstances, be from 1 December 2017 to 31 May 2018. a Eligibility All colleagues and full-time Directors of the Group, who have been in continuous service for such period of time not exceeding five years as may be determined by the Board prior to the relevant date of grant of an option and who are liable to UK income tax, are eligible to participate in the SAYE.
Participation may also be offered, at the discretion of the Board taking account of the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, to other Directors or employees who otherwise do not satisfy all of the above criteria, although non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the SAYE.
b Issue of invitations Invitations to participate in the SAYE may be made during each 42 day period from and including i the date on which any amendment to the SAYE is approved or adopted by the Companys shareholders ii the announcement of the Companys final or interim results for any financial period, iii the occurrence of an event which the Remuneration Committee considers to be an exceptional event concerning the Group or iv changes to the legislation affecting tax approved SAYE option schemes coming into effect.
If any of the above periods is a close period as a result of the application of the Model Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Companies or as a result of the Companys equivalent internal share dealing rules and the Company is prohibited from issuing invitations and or granting options as a result then invitations may be made within 42 days of the end of the close period.
Invitations may be issued by the trustee of an employee benefit trust.
No invitations may be issued or options granted more than ten years after the adoption of the SAYE.
c Exercise price The price at which an option holder may acquire Shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than the greater of 80% of the market value of a Share at the time of grant and its nominal value.
d Savings contract Options may be granted by the Board or the trustee of an employee benefit trust.
Upon applying for an option, the colleague will be required to enter into an approved savings contract with a savings institution nominated by the Company which lasts for either three or five years.
The maximum amount which an employee is permitted to contribute under SAYE contracts is 250 per month increasing to 500 per month from 6 April 2014.
The Board may set lower savings limits than this for different colleagues by reference to objective criteria such as levels of salary or length of service.
The minimum contribution is 5 per month or such greater amount as the Board may specify, not to exceed 10.
The total exercise price of the Shares over which the option is granted may not exceed the aggregate of the monthly contributions and bonus payable at the end of the colleagues related SAYE contract.
e Scheme limits The number of newly issued Shares over which or in respect of which options may be granted under the SAYE on any date of grant shall be limited so that the total number of Shares issued or capable of being issued in any ten year period under all the Companys employee share schemes including the CIP, CSOP, PSP and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments is restricted to 10% of the Companys issued Shares calculated at the relevant time.
Any options or rights to acquire shares granted before, on or in connection with Admission will be excluded from this limit, and no account will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting.
f Exercisability Options will normally be exercisable during a period of six months following the allocation of a bonus under the related SAYE contract and will normally lapse upon cessation of employment.
Earlier exercise is, however, permitted if the colleague dies or leaves employment through injury, disability, redundancy or retirement or where a colleague leaves employment of the Group by reason of his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group, or if the undertaking in which he is employed is sold outside the Group.
Early exercise will also be permitted in the event of a takeover, reconstructions or voluntary winding up of the Company.

Share based payments continued Fair value of share awards The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over a relevant period prior to award on 17 March 2014.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as 3 years.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds with a life equal to this expected life.
Options were valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the non-market based EPS element performance conditions and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the market-based TSR element performance conditions.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company which employs the option holder ceases to be part of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
The key assumptions used in the fair value of the awards were as follows: At grant date CIP PSP CSOP SAYE Share price 2.45 2.45 2.31 1.75 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 1.75 1.45 Expected volatility 30% 30% 37% 30% Option life years 3 10 10 3 Expected dividend yield 2.00% 2.00% 2.00% 2.00% Risk free interest rate 1.07% 1.07% 2.25% 1.07% Weighted average fair value of options granted 2.06 2.06 0.75 0.47 As both the CIP and PSP awards have a nil exercise price the risk free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value.
