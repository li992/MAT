William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30.
Retirement benefit schemes 132 The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The UK schemes are operated under a single trust and the assets of all the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The respective costs of these schemes are as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 29 December 30 December 2015 2014 m m Defined contribution schemes charged to profit before interest and tax 11.1 11.1 Defined benefit scheme charged to profit before interest and tax 2.1 1.9 Defined benefit scheme credited charged to finance costs 1.2 0.6 Defined benefit scheme charged credited to other comprehensive income 14.9 36.4 26.9 22.8 Defined contribution schemes The defined contribution schemes, to which both the Group and employees contribute to fund the benefits, are available for all eligible employees.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the respective schemes.
At 29 December 2015, contributions of 0.1m 30 December 2014: 1.3m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK for eligible employees which closed to new members in 2002.
Under the scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 1.67% and 3.33% of final pensionable pay for each year of service on attainment of a retirement age of 63.
With effect from 1 April 2011, the defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual but maintains the link for benefits accrued up to 31 March 2011 with future salary increases up to a maximum of 5% per annum.
Employed members of this scheme were automatically transferred into one of the defined contribution schemes.
The costs of administering the scheme are borne by the Group.
The general principles adopted by the Trustees for the purposes of this funding valuation are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions already in payment to continue to be paid, and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pension rights.
The Group expects to make deficit repair contributions of 9.4m to the scheme during 2016 plus a 1.9m contribution towards the cost of life assurance and costs of running the scheme.
For the purposes of preparing the information disclosed in these accounts, a full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 30 September 2013 and updated to 29 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Disclosure of principal assumptions The financial assumptions used by the actuary in determining the present value of the defined benefit schemes liabilities were: 29 December 30 December 2015 2014 Rate of increase of salaries 3.10% 3.10% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.10% 3.00% Discount rate 3.80% 3.80% Rate of RPI inflation 3.10% 3.10% Rate of CPI inflation 2.10% 2.20% In accordance with the relevant accounting standard, the discount rate has been determined by reference to market yields at the period end date on high quality fixed income investments at a term consistent with the expected duration of the liabilities.
Price inflation is determined by the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds with an adjustment to allow for differences in the demand for these bonds, which can distort this figure.
The Bank of England target inflation rate has also been considered in setting this assumption.
The expected rate of salary growth and pension increases are set with reference to the expected rate of inflation.
No change has been made to the basis of inflation applied to pension increases in the scheme.
The mortality assumption is kept under review and has been updated.
The current life expectancies for a member underlying the value of the accrued liabilities are: 29 December 30 December Life expectancy at age 65 2015 2014 Member currently aged 65 22 years 22 years Member currently aged 40 25 years 25 years William Hill PLC Strategic Annual Report and Accounts 2015 report Governance 30.

Retirement benefit schemes 134 Movements in the present value of fair value of scheme assets in the current period were as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 29 December 30 December 2015 2014 m m At beginning of period 368.0 310.3 Movement in period: Interest income on assets 13.9 14.5 Remeasurements return on plan assets excluding interest income 13.0 45.5 Contributions from the sponsoring companies 11.3 11.0 Administration expenses charged to profit before interest and tax 1.0 0.9 Benefits paid 12.6 11.4 Insurance premium for risk benefits 1.1 1.0 At end of period 365.5 368.0 Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities The sensitivity of the present value of the schemes liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated in the table that follows.
The illustrations consider the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
In addition, changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of the scheme assets, which may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
Assumption Changes in assumption Impact on defined benefit liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 25% p. a.
Increase of 16.9m Rate of increase in inflation Increase by 25% p. a.
Increase of 15.9m Members assumed to live Life expectancy one year longer Increase of 9.9m If the change in assumptions were in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact on the defined benefit liabilities would be of a similar magnitude, but in the opposite direction.
Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the defined benefit scheme Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 365.5m and 342.5m respectively were held on the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 29 December 2015 30 December 2014: 368.0m and 340.5m respectively.
Through the scheme the Group is exposed to a number of potential risks as described below: Asset volatility: the schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: however in addition to corporate bonds, the scheme invests in asset classes other than corporate bonds which may out or underperform corporate bonds in the long term but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Changes in bond yields: the risk of a decrease in bond yields, which increases the value of the scheme liabilities, is partially offset by the upside benefit of an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation and therefore higher inflation would result in a higher defined benefit obligation.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation or only loosely correlated with inflation and therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy: if the schemes members live longer than expected, the schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the defined benefit obligation longevity risk.
The Trustees and the Company manage the investment risk asset volatility in the scheme by investing c90% of the schemes investments in Liability Driven Investments LDI strategies which aim to invest in assets whose values move broadly in tandem with changes in liability values arising from market movements.
The Company accepts and indemnifies the other residual risks in the scheme including longevity risk.
Funding Alongside the risk assessment above, the Group has agreed a deficit recovery plan with the Trustees aimed at eliminating the deficit over the period to 2019, as described in note 21.
The weighted average duration of the schemes defined benefit obligation as at 29 December 2015 is 20 years 30 December 2014: 23 years.
There were no plan amendments, curtailments or settlements during the period.
