Dividends Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately declared and authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.

Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
The pension schemes surplus, to the extent that it is considered recoverable, or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet net of the related deferred tax.

122 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C. 27.
Accounting policies continued Warranty on the sale of products The Company provides a warranty from the date of purchase on all its products.
This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is given for a small number of products.
A warranty provision is included in the accounts, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Derivative financial instruments In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inflows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Anyeffective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the profit and loss account at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Theineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreignexchange differences arising on such translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.
