Financials 239 G8: Amounts owed to bank depositors In the Groups banking businesses the Group receives cash from bank depositors.
The depositors receive interest on the amounts owed depending on the value of the amount borrowed and the terms of the deposit.
The table below provides an analysis of the categories and maturity profiles of amounts owed to depositors: At 31 December 2015 m More than Less 3 months Between More Carrying than less than 1 and than amount 3 months 1 year 5 years 5 years Total Current accounts 3,196 3,196 3,196 Savings deposits 1,349 1,339 2 5 2 1,348 Other deposits and loan accounts 23,090 17,337 3,363 2,304 488 23,492 Negotiable certificates of deposit 4,012 1,059 2,159 1,147 3 4,368 Deposits received under repurchase agreements 681 681 681 Amounts owed to bank depositors 32,328 23,612 5,524 3,456 493 33,085 At 31 December 2014 m More than Less 3 months Between More Carrying than less than 1 and than amount 3 months 1 year 5 years 5 years Total Current accounts 3,621 3,621 3,621 Savings deposits 1,556 1,509 45 2 1,556 Other deposits and loan accounts 26,213 20,021 3,650 2,849 593 27,113 Negotiable certificates of deposit 4,150 1,023 2,062 1,425 18 4,528 Deposits received under repurchase agreements 703 703 703 Amounts owed to bank depositors 36,243 26,877 5,757 4,276 611 37,521 H: Non-financial assets and liabilities H1: Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and represents the premium of the amount paid over the fair value of identifiable asset and liabilities.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Other intangible assets include those assets which were initially recognised on a business combination and software development costs relate to amounts recognised for in-house systems development.
a Goodwill and goodwill impairment Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an asset at the date that control is achieved the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously-held equity interest if any, this excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Non-controlling interest is measured at fair value of the stake held by third parties on initial recognition of the business combination and is adjusted for profit or loss and movements in reserves.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least once annually.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On loss of control of a subsidiary undertaking, any attributable goodwill is included in the determination of any profit or loss on disposal.
On disposal of a business, where goodwill on acquisition is allocated to the entire cash-generating unit CGU, goodwill is allocated to the disposal on a relative basis.
Goodwill is allocated to one or more CGUs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
The directors annually test for impairment of each CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and intangible assets, at a level that is no larger than that of the Groups identified operating segments for the purposes of segment reporting.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU or group of CGUs exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.

The capitalised value is the present value of cash flows anticipated in the future from the relevant book of insurance and investment contract policies acquired at the date of the acquisition.
This is calculated by performing a cash flow projection of the associated life assurance fund and book of in-force policies in order to estimate future after tax profits attributable to shareholders.
The valuation is based on actuarial principles taking into account future premium income, mortality, disease and surrender probabilities, together with future costs and investment returns on the assets supporting the fund.
These profits are discounted at a rate of return allowing for the risk of uncertainty of the future cash flows.
The key assumptions impacting the valuation are discount rate, future investment returns and the rate at which policies discontinue.
The asset is amortised over the expected profit recognition period on a systematic basis over the anticipated lives of the related contracts.
The amortisation charge is stated net of any unwind in the discount rate used to calculate the asset.
The recoverable amount of the asset is recalculated at each reporting date and any impairment losses recognised accordingly.
c Other intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination Contractual banking and asset management customer relationships, relationships with distribution channels and similar intangible assets, acquired as a part of a business combination, are capitalised at their fair value, represented by the estimated net present value of the future cash flows from the relevant relationships acquired at the date of acquisition.
Brands and similar items acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at their fair value based on a relief from royalty valuation methodology.
Subsequent to initial recognition such acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as set out below: Distribution channels 10 years Customer relationships 10 years Brand 15 to 20 years The estimated useful life is re-evaluated on a regular basis.
Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination would be immediately impaired if the carrying value is greater than the net recoverable amount.
d Internally developed software Internally developed software software is amortised over its estimated useful life, where applicable.
Such assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software is recognised in the statement of financial position if, and only if, it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the software will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Costs incurred in the research phase are expensed whereas costs incurred in the development phase are capitalised subject to meeting specific criteria, set out in the relevant accounting guidance.
The main criteria being that future economic benefits can be identified as a result of the development expenditure.
Amortisation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relevant software, which range between two and ten years.
e Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

An impairment charge is recognised when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.
The cash flows attributable to the value of new business are determined with reference to latest approved three-year business plans.
Projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using an inflation-based growth assumption.
The value-in-use calculations for the life assurance operations are determined using the reported embedded value methodology plus a discounted cash flow calculation for the value of new business.
The value of new business represents the present value of future profits from expected new business.
Embedded value represents the shareholders interest in the life assurance business and is calculated in accordance with MCEV principles.
The cash flows that have been used to determine the value-in-use of the cash generating units are based on the three-year business plans.
These cash flows grow at different rates because of the different strategies of the cash generating units.
In cases where the cash generating units have made significant acquisitions in the recent past, the profits are forecasted to grow faster than the more mature businesses.
Post the five-year growth forecast, the growth rate used to determine the terminal value of the cash generating units approximated the long-term growth rate of the countries in which it operates.
Emerging Markets The Emerging Markets CGUs generate revenues through their life assurance, asset management, property & casualty and banking businesses in several regions, but principally Africa and Latin America.
Emerging markets carries goodwill in four distinct CGUs: Old Mutual South Africa OMSA, Mutual and Federal M&F, Latin America LatAm and Old Mutual Southern and Eastern Africa OMSEA.
The basis of allocating the impairment tests changed in the current year due to the refinement of the strategy for Emerging Markets, which has led to a regional focus on the performance of the underlying businesses as a group.
The directors are satisfied that any reasonable change in the assumptions would not cause the recoverable amounts of the goodwill to fall below the carrying amounts.
Growth rate the rates assumed beyond the business planning period for years four and five were: OMSA nil, LatAm 18.0%, and OMSEA 18.0% 2014: 9.0% to 12.0%.
Based on the carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2015, the weighted average growth rate for Emerging Markets was 13.5%.
Growth rates beyond the planning period were assumed to be the expected inflation rate in all the regions, except for OMSEA where the rate is greater than inflation in the first seven years due to the expected synergies of the OMSEA businesses Discount rate the rate applied was 13.5% 2014: 13.5% for all the CGUs and used the relevant 10-year government bond rate as a starting point, which was adjusted for an equity market risk premium and other relevant risk adjustments, which were determined using market valuation models and other observable references.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 243 Old Mutual Wealth The Old Mutual Wealth CGU generate revenues through its life assurance and asset management businesses.
Old Mutual Wealth is regarded by the directors as a single cash generating unit due to the integrated nature of its operations.
On disposals of businesses, goodwill is allocated to them based on the relative size of the net assets of the business.
The Group has revised the goodwill impairment model in the current year because of the change in underlying nature of the business following the disposal of most of its European businesses during 2014 and 2015.
The directors are satisfied that any reasonable change in the assumptions would not cause the recoverable amounts of Old Mutual Wealth to fall below its carrying amount.
Growth rate the rate used was 5% 2014: 14.0% for the three-year business plan period and the expected inflation rate for the period beyond this Discount rate the rate applied was 9.0% 2014: 9.0% and used the relevant 10-year government bond rate as a starting point, which was adjusted for an equity market risk premium and other relevant risk adjustments, which were determined using market valuation models and other observable references.
Nedbank The impairment test in respect of the Nedbank CGU has been performed by comparing the CGUs net carrying amount to its estimated value-in-use.
The value-in-use has been determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are the discount rate and growth rate, which are based on the three year business plan plus the terminal value.
A growth rate between 0.0%, international business and 4.8%, South African business 2014: 0.0% and 5.8% was applied to extrapolate cash flows for an additional two years beyond the three-year business plan period.
A terminal value, using the same growth rate, is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The discount rate applied varied between 9.8% and 15.4% 2014: 9.1% to 13.3%.
The directors are satisfied that a reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill to fall below the carrying amount.
Institutional Asset Management The impairment test in respect of the Institutional Asset Managements CGU has been performed by comparing the CGUs net carrying amount to its value-in-use determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value-inuse calculations for Institutional Asset Management are as follows: The three-year business plan plus two further years have growth rate assumptions based on managements expectation of performance over this period.
A terminal value, using a long-term growth rate of 4.0% 2014: 4.0% is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The assumed long-term growth rate was determined with reference to nominal historical gross domestic product GDP growth, and the outlook for nominal GDP growth for the US The risk-adjusted discount rate applied was 12.5% 2014: 12.0%.

In 2015, Emerging Markets made revaluation gains of 1 million on land 2014: 6 million and 7 million 2014: 6 million on buildings.
Nedbank made revaluation gains of 1 million on land 2014: 6 million and 11 million on buildings 2014: 10 million.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials For Emerging Markets, land and buildings are valued as at 31 December each year by internal professional valuers and external 245 valuations are obtained once every three years.
For Nedbank, valuations are performed every three years by external professional valuers.
For each business, the valuation methodology adopted is dependent upon the nature of the property.
Income-generating assets are valued using discounted cash flows and vacant land and property are valued according to sales of comparable properties.
The carrying value that would have been recognised had the land and buildings been carried under the historic cost model would be 22 million 2014: 28 million and 146 million 2014: 171 million respectively for Emerging Markets, 12 million 2014: 15 million and 89 million 2014: 113 million for Nedbank respectively.

The principal subsidiaries where a non-controlling interest exists is Nedbank, the Groups banking business in South Africa and OM Asset Management plc, the Groups asset management business.

These reflect the legal ownership of this business following the implementation for Black Economic Empowerment BEE schemes in 2005.

Therefore the effective ownership interest of the minorities reflected in arriving at profit after tax in the consolidated income statement is lower than that applied in arriving at adjusted operating profit after tax.
In 2015 the increase in adjusted operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests as a result of this was 13 million 2014: 24 million.
