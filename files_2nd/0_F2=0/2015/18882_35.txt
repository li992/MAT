thatare reported to the Chief Executive include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated g Goodwill ona reasonable basis.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation ofthe value in use of CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate to be made of the timing and amount of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and the application of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value.
Cash flow forecasts forthe next three years are based on the Groups budgets and forecasts.
Other key inputs in assessing each CGU are revenue growth, operating margin and discount rate.
The assumptions are set out in note 12 together with an assessment of the impact of reasonably possible sensitivities.
h Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are items of financial performance which theGroup believes should be separately identified on the face of the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
Determining whetheran item is part of underlying or non-underlying items requires judgement.
A total non-underlying cost of 61.3m after tax was charged to the income statement for the year ended 30 June 2015. i Held for sale and discontinued operations When it is probable that businesses will be sold within one year and they are being actively marketed they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
Discontinued operations are businesses or a group of businesses which meet the criteria to be held for sale, have been sold or abandoned, and form a separate major line of business of the Group.
Management judgement is applied in assessing the timing of sale to meet the classification criteria.

The Pension Protection Fund levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Other defined benefit schemes Acquired with the May Gurney group The May Gurney and TransLinc defined benefit schemes were acquired with May Gurney in the 2014 financial year.
Both of these definedbenefit schemes have closed to future accrual and the sum of the deficit contributions to both plans payable in the period to 30June 2015 amounted to 0.3m 2014: 0.3m.
Thetrustees are responsible fordecisions and holding the assets, and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investmentmanagers.
The TransLinc defined benefit scheme is associated with Kier FPS Limited, which was sold shortly after the end of the financial year.
Therefore the assets and liabilities of the TransLinc defined benefit scheme have been transferred out of the pension liability and into assets liabilities held for sale see note 19.
An actuarial valuation of the May Gurney scheme was undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 31 March 2014 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date was 62.0m which represented approximately 83% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in pensionable salaries.
Deficit contributions for the 2015 16 financial year of 1.6m have been agreed with the trustees.

The public sector comparable parts of the schemes are still open to future accrual, but the remainder was closed to future accrual in 2010.
There is a deficit recovery plan in place, requiring deficit contributions of7.8m in the coming year.
In total, the schemes currently have 78 active members, 3,042 deferred members and 1,305 retirees.
The Mouchel schemes were formally valued by the trustees independent actuaries as at 31 March 2013 and will need to be valued again in 2016.
Other defined contribution schemes Contributions are also made to a number of other defined contribution arrangements.
The Group paid contributions of 29.2m 2014:26.7m during the year to these arrangements.

When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate theliability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared with the previous period.

2 Restated to reclassify the Groups UK mining operations as discontinued.
Kier Group and its subsidiaries are based predominantly in the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax.
The Group does not have anaggressive tax policy and since 1 July 2012 Kier has not entered into any tax avoidance schemes which were or should have beennotified under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Scheme rules.
2 The tax charge before non-underlying items and amortisation of contract rights of 16.9m 2014 : 13.5m shown in the table above 2 2 equates to an effective tax rate of 20% 2014 : 18% on adjusted profit before tax of 86.2m 2014 : 73.8m.
This effective rate islower than the standard rate of corporation tax of 20.75% 2014: 22.5% due to a number of items shown in the table above.
Thenon-deductible expenses mainly relate to acquisition costs on Mouchel and permanent differences on provisions.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, capital gains arising on disposal of certain investments, including some of the joint ventures disposed of during the year, are not subject to tax.
Tax relief on expenses not recognised in the income statement includes the impact of the tax deduction received in respect of the cost ofshares exercised under the Groups employee Save As You Earn Scheme and LTIP.
The net credit adjustment of 0.4m in respect of prior years results arises from differences between the estimates of taxation included inthe previous years financial statements and the actual tax liabilities calculated in the tax returns submitted to and agreed by HMRC.

These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
As the changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date their effects are not included in these financial statements.
The overall effect of these changes, if they had applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by an additional 1.1m with 4.6m being credited to the income statement and 5.7m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
The deferred tax balance as at the year end has been recognised at 20%.
e Tax losses At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of 177.3m 2014: 14.8m available for offset against future profits.
Adeferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 43.2m 2014: 14.7m of income tax losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

EPS has been restated toreflect the bonus element embedded in the rights issue.
Goodwill relates to the acquisition of MRBL Limited 301.3m, May Gurney Integrated Services PLC 194.7m, Kier Partnership Homes Limited 5.2m, Pure Recycling Limited 4.8m, Beco Limited 2.6m and Southdale 0.8m.
These balances have been subject to an annual impairment review based upon the projected profits of each CGU.
The cost of contract rights primarily relates to: The acquisition of the businesses and assets of the construction and business services operations of Sheffield City Council 21.3m, Harlow Council 0.8m, Stoke-on-Trent City Council 1.9m and North Tyneside Council 7.2m.
These contracts are inpartnership with the respective councils that have retained a participatory ownership interest and the rights for a minority share inthe profits.

The recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow projections based on the Groups forecasts, approved by management, covering a three-year period.
The resulting cash flows are discounted to present value, with the discount rate used in the value in use calculations based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the assets being tested.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the forecast revenues and gross margins during the forecast period and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.
Cash flows for periods beyond those forecast have a terminal growth rate assumption applied.
Significant headroom exists in all CGUs and management considers that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not lead to an impairment being recognised.
Services segment A revenue growth rate of 2% and a fixed operating margin of 5% have been applied to the Services segment cash flows into perpetuity.
These assumptions are in line with current trading and current forecasts of UK GDP growth rate.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 10.0% 2014: 9.1%.
Based on the value in use calculation, these assumptions derived a recoverable amount for the Services segment that is 474m above the carrying value of segmental assets.
The Services CGU impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions: discount rate, revenue growth rate and the operating margin, although management do not consider that any reasonable possible change in any single assumption would give rise to an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.

The assets and liabilities of Kier Minerals Ltd KML have been classified as held for sale and discontinued, discussions to sell were well advanced at the year end and the Group has made a strategic decision to exit from its UK mining operations, which constitute a separate major line of business for the Group.
KML is expected to be sold in the first half of FY16.
The Groups interest in two of its property ventures Kier Catterick Limited KCL and Justice Support Services Norfolk and Suffolk Holdings Limited JSS are also held for sale.
JSS was also held for sale at the previous balance sheet date, however did not complete during FY15 due to a delay in finalising the details of sale.
The Group is now at an advanced stage of a sale process and completion is likely in the first half of FY16, therefore JSS continues to be presented as held for sale and not fully consolidated.

Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing and is subject to the Group achieving specific performance targets.
Awards under the LTIP are all equity settled.
The awards which are taken as shares are intended to be satisfied from the following shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust and May Gurney Group Trustees Ltd Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust rather than from the issue of new shares.
These shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings.

The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance conditions are market conditions under IFRS2 Share-based Payments.

The fair value therefore does not include an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded.
Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a true-up for the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UKGovernment bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
3.4m relating to share-based payments has been recognised in the income statement as employee costs 2014: 4.0m.
Included in other payables is an amount of 0.3m 2014: 0.5m relating to provisions for employers national insurance.

27 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern: to optimise the capital structure in order to minimise the cost of capital: and to maintain a strong balance sheet to support business development and tender qualification.
The four operating divisions of the Group have complementary capital characteristics, with the Construction division, and to a lesser extent the Services division, generating a net cash surplus, whilst the Property and Residential divisions require net capital to fund developments.
The Groups capital management strategy is to use a blend of capital types with different risk, return and maturity profiles to support the operating divisions and deliver the Groups capital management objectives.
The Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2014.
The capital structure of the Group comprises: equity, consisting of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity: and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 20 and described further below.
The Group forecasts and monitors short, medium and longer-term capital needs on a regular basis and adjusts its capital structure as required through the payment of dividends to shareholders, the issue of new share capital and the increase or repayment of borrowings.
All investment decisions are made with regard to the Groups weighted average cost of capital and typically apre-tax annualised return of at least 15% is required to ensure such investments are value enhancing for shareholders.
152 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise anypotential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury team manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating limits approved by the Board.
Treasury isnot a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure tofluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
The Groups most significant clients are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the client.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual, receivable accounts.
There is no group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below: 2015 2014 m m Provision as at 1 July 2.3 1.3 Acquired in the year 11.6 1.8 Charged credited to the income statement 0.1 0.8 Provision as at 30 June 14.0 2.3 There were 109.1m 2014: 48.8m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 64.2m 2014: 37.8m had been received by the end of August 2015.
There are no indications as at 30 June 2015 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided.

The Groups borrowings can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Fixed rate 182.7 62.7 Variable rate 212.1 172.5 394.8 235.2 In addition, a number of the Groups joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps where there is significant interest rate.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where significant foreign currency exposures are identified, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts or swaps.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a syndicate of relationship banks inthe form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
The amount of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Derivative financial instruments Current Non-current Total At 30 June 2015 liabilities liabilities liabilities Discontinued operations m m m Fuel price forward contracts 0.4 0.4 Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as derivatives held at fair value through the income statement.
The fair value of these contracts has been determined based on a level 2 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on observable market data.
During 2013 Kier Group plc entered into three cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on aUS dollar denominated loan, nominal value US$28m.
During 2014 Kier Group plc entered into four cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nominal value US$116m.
These swaps have continued to meet the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, how those cash flows will impact the income statement and the fair value of the related hedging instruments: Expected cash flows More than Fair value Total 01 years 12 years 25 years 5 years Continuing operations m m m m m m Cross-currency swaps: Liabilities 1.5 34.6 4.1 4.1 12.1 14.3 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.

At 30 June 2015 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interestbearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 123.4m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2015, based on quoted prices in active markets, amounted to 22.0m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 4.4m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
