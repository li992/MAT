IFRS Financial statements 42 Financial guarantees and options continued Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2015 for this guarantee is 29 million 2014: 28 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2015, total sums at risk for these contracts were 44 million 2014: 70 million out of total unit-linked funds of 16 billion 2014: 15 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 54.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 45 million 2014: 36 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 10 million 2014: 12 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2015 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and up to 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2015, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 1 billion 2014: 1 billion with a further reserve of 14 million 2014: 6 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 13.8 billion 2014: 13.9 billion, with a further provision of 41 million 2014: 42 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 12 million 2014: 34 million in Spain and nil 2014: nil in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% subject to a minimum of 0% from end 2015 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 0.91% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
In the local valuation there is no allowance for stochastic modelling of guarantees and options.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.

2 The movement during 2015 relates to Friends Life, as at the acquisition date.
The movement during 2014 includes 12 million related to the disposal of Eurovita and 1 million related to the disposal of CxG.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets and mainly relates to business in the UK, with corresponding movements in gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 44, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.
