Share-based payments Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Companys executive share option, long-term incentive and share purchase and ordinary share plan schemes.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant including the impact of non-vesting conditions such as requirement for employees to save and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to thefailure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions.
