Additional tier 1 capital securities HSBC has included three types of additional tier 1 capital securities in its tier 1 capital.
Additional tier 1 capital securities are perpetual subordinated securities on which coupon payments may be deferred or cancelled at the discretion of HSBC Holdings.
The securities presented in this Note are accounted for as liabilities because HSBC has an obligation to pay dividends in perpetuity.
See Note 35 for the other two types of additional tier 1 capital securities accounted for as equity.
The additional tier 1 securities presented in this section do not meet the identifying criteria in full for recognition as tier 1 capital under CRD IV but are eligible as regulatory capital subject to grandfathering limits and progressive phase-out.
Guaranteed by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc The five capital securities above that are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc HSBC Bank and are non-cumulative step-up perpetual preferred securities issued by Jersey limited partnerships.
The proceeds of the issues were on-lent to the respective guarantors by the limited partnerships in the form of subordinated notes.
These preferred securities qualify as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC under CRD IV by virtue of the application of grandfathering provisions, and the two capital securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank also qualify as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC Bank on a solo and a consolidated basis under CRD IV by virtue of the same grandfathering process.
