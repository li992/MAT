Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 134 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17 Business combinations continued Where this could be determined, the acquired subsidiaries contributed 14.3m to the profit before tax of the Group.
If these acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2014, Group revenue would have been an estimated 4,459.0m and Group profit before tax would have been an estimated 299.2m.
In determining these amounts, management assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014.
During 2014, some of the acquired businesses were completely integrated into the existing business of the Group and therefore their post-acquisition performance could not be determined.
Post-acquisition 2014 underlying earnings benefited from a 3.9m favourable litigation settlement, for which a provision was included in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition in 2013.
Goodwill arose on the acquisitions because the fair value of the acquired assets was lower than the consideration paid: the goodwill represents the value to the Group that can be driven from these underlying assets over the life of the acquired businesses, particularly from synergies, and the capabilities of the acquired workforce.
The total amount of goodwill recognised that was expected to be deductible for tax purposes was 9.6m 2013: 103.4m.
In total, the effect of revisions made to fair value adjustments in 2014 that had been determined provisionally at the immediately preceding balance sheet date increased goodwill by 0.5m.
Contingent consideration In respect of the acquisitions made in 2014, the Group agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 3 years in duration and will be settled in cash on their payment date on achieving the relevant target.
The range of the additional consideration payment is estimated to be between 30m and 48m.
The Group included 39.5m as contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represented its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration was calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 14.2m related to professional fees paid for due diligence, general professional fees and legal related costs.
These costs were included in non-underlying administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement.
