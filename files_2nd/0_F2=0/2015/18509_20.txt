2 On 14 August 2014, the Group purchased the non-controlling interests share of Hull Trains Limited for a consideration of 3.0m and on 24 March 2015, the Group purchased the non-controlling interests share of Cardinal Coach Lines UCL for a consideration of CAD$17.0m.
As both of these represent a transaction with minority equity owners of the business without a change of control, they have been recognised as an equity transaction in the Groups reserves and not as a business combination or investment.
3 On 25 August 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of a 51% share in Miles Square Transportation, Inc, a school bus transportation company based in New York.
Included within the purchase agreement is a put option for the Group to purchase the remaining 49% from the non-controlling interest party for axed price of US$19.1m.
As the put option is a contract to purchase the Groups own equity instruments it gives rise to a financial liability for the xed price amount in accordance with paragraph 23 in IAS 32.
The financial liability has been recognised in the balance sheet and the initial recognition is treated as reclassied from equity.
The accompanying notes form an integral part of this consolidated statement of changes in equity.
