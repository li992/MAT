Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts The Group sponsors Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trusts to acquire and hold shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc to satisfy awards made under employee incentive plans and options granted under employee share option schemes.
The trustees of the ESOP Trusts purchase shares with finance provided by the Group by way of loans or contributions.
In 2014, Treasury shares with a carrying value of 150 million were purchased by the UK ESOP Trust to satisfy future awards under the shareholder approved Performance Share Plan.
The costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement.
Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves and amortised down to the value of proceeds, if any, receivable from employees on exercise by a transfer to retained earnings.
The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.

Under the original agreements, GSK had the unconditional right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to its shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of either put option.
In February 2016, GSK notied Pzer and Shionogi that it had irrevocably given up this right.
This will lead to recognition of a liability for these put options on the Groups balance sheet in 2016.
The estimated present value of the liability for the two put options is approximately 2 billion, after adjustments for the value of preferential dividends due to each of the shareholders.
Consistent with this revised treatment, in 2016 GSK will also recognise liabilities on the Groups balance sheet for the future preferential dividends anticipated to become payable to Pzer and Shionogi.
The estimated aggregate present value of the liability for preferential dividends to both Pzer and Shionogi is approximately 170 million.
On 22 February 2016, ViiV Healthcare completed two previously announced transactions with Bristol-Myers Squibb BMS.
ViiV Healthcare acquired late-stage R&D assets from BMS for an initial upfront payment of $317 million followed by development and first commercial sale milestones of up to $518 million, and tiered royalties on sales.
ViiV Healthcare also acquired BMSs preclinical and discovery stage HIV research business for an upfront payment of $33 million, followed by development and first commercial sales milestones of up to $587 million, and further consideration contingent on future sales performance.
