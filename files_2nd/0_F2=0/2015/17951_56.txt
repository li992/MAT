A. and the Groups activities to maintain the current ownership in RAI following its acquisition ofLorillard, Inc. : ii the Groups investment of US$4.7 billion in cash in RAI has realised a deemed gain of US$931 million 601 million.
This has arisen as the contract to acquire shares is deemed to be a financial instrument and has been fair valued through profit and loss, in compliance with IAS39Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The deemed gain reflects the difference between the fixed price paid by the Group to RAI and the market value of RAI shares on the day of the transaction see note 11 : and iii as described in note 6, the Group received 963 million from HM Revenue & Customs in relation to the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO.
The payment was received subject to an ongoing appeals process and was made with no admission of liability.

Any future repayment by the Group is subject to interest and, as any recognition of income will be deemed to be adjusting due to size, interest of 8 million has been accrued and treated as an adjusting item.

b Master Settlement Agreement In 1998, the major US cigarette manufacturers including R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson entered into the Master Settlement Agreement MSA with attorney generals representing most US states and territories.
The MSA imposes a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on the major US cigarette manufacturers.
The amounts of money that the participating manufacturers are required to annually contribute are based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold and market share based on cigarette shipments in that year.
Given these facts, the Groups accounting for the MSA payments is to accrue for them in the cost of products sold as the products are shipped and no provision is made in respect of potential payments relating to future years.
The event which gives rise to the obligation is the actual sale of products shipped and the MSA payments are therefore recognised as part of the costs of those business operations.
During 2013, RAI, various other tobacco manufacturers, 19 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico reached a final agreement related to RAIs 2003 MSA activities.
Under this agreement RAI will receive credits, currently estimated to be more than US$1 billion, in respect of its NPM Adjustment claims related to the period from 2003 to 2012.
These credits will be applied against the companys MSA payments over a period of five years from 2013, subject to, and dependent upon, meeting the various ongoing performance obligations.
During 2014, two additional states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2003 to 2012.
It is estimated that RAI will receive US$170 million in credits, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2014.
During 2015, another state agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2014.
It is estimated that RAI will receive US$285 million in credits, which will be applied over a four-year period from 2015.
Credits in respect of future years payments and the NPM Adjustment claims would be accounted for in the applicable year and will not be treated as adjusting items.
Only credits in respect of prior year payments are included as adjusting items.
