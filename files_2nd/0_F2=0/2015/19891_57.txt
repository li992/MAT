PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS For defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement.
The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments such events are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market.
All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
The Group policy is that the most important plans, representing approximately 85% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year.
Other major plans, accounting for a further 13% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the companys obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans.
The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.

PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED DESCRIPTION OF PLANS The Group increasingly operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
In certain countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans and operate on a funded basis.
Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
GOVERNANCE The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Where Trustees or equivalent are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plans stakeholders.
They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the fund in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the long-term investment and funding strategy.
The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the companys policies and decision making on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans continue to invest a good proportion of the assets in equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain markets, inflation risk.
There are no unusual entity or plan specific risks to the Group.
For risk control, the pension funds also have significant investments in liability matching assets bonds as well as in property and other alternative assets: additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets.
The aim is to provide high-quality, well diversified, cost-effective, risk-controlled vehicles.
The pension plans investments are overseen by Unilevers internal investment company, the Univest Company.
ASSUMPTIONS With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal defined benefit plans which cover approximately 96% of total pension liabilities and the plans providing other post-employment benefits.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.

These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The years of life expectancy for 2015 above have been translated from the following tables: UK: the year of use S1 series all pensioners S1PA tables have been adopted, which are based on the experience of UK pension schemes over the period 2000-2006.
Scaling factors are applied reflecting the experience of our pension funds appropriate to the members gender and status.
Future improvements in longevity have been allowed for in line with the 2012 CMI core projections and a 1% pa long-term improvement rate.
The Netherlands: the Dutch Actuarial Societys AG Prognosetafel 2014 table is used with correction factors to allow for the typically longer life expectancy for fund members relative to the general population.
This table has an in-built allowance for future improvements in longevity.
United States: the table RP-2015 with MP-2015 generational mortality improvement.
Germany: fund specific tables are used which broadly equate to the Heubeck 2005 generational table projected to 2030.
Assumptions for the remaining defined benefit plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.

PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The actual return on plan assets during 2015 was 398 million, being the sum of 254 million and 652 million from the table above 2014:2,096 million.
The duration of the principal defined benefit liabilities at 31 December 2015 is between 9 and 18 years 2014: 9 and 19 years.
Theliabilities are split between different categories of plan participants as follows: active members 18.7% 2014: 19.6% : deferred members 23.4% 2014: 23.1% : and retired members 57.9% 2014: 57.3%.
ASSETS The fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period for our major and principal plans for each category are as follows: million million 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 Other postOther postemployment employment Pension benefit Pension benefit plans plans plans plans Total Assets 20,723 19 20,466 18 Equities Total 7,993 8,336 Europe 2,526 2,957 North America 3,313 3,086 Other 2,154 2,293 Fixed Income Total 9,741 18 8,864 17 Government bonds 4,870 18 4,637 17 Investment grade corporate bonds 2,970 2,749 Other fixed income 1,901 1,478 Derivatives 1,647 1,182 Private Equity 721 762 Property and Real Estate 1,689 1,384 Hedge Funds 1,123 1,050 Other 810 1 962 1 Other plans 293 290 The fair values of the above equity and fixed income instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets.
Thefair value of private equity, properties, derivatives and hedge funds are not based on quoted market prices in active markets.
The Group uses swaps to hedge some of its exposure to inflation and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency exposures in part are also hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Assets included in the Other category are commodities, cash and insurance contracts which are also unquoted assets.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 14 million 0.1% of total plan assets and 71 million 0.3% of total plan assets at 31 December 2015 and 2014 respectively.
Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to 17 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 15 million.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benefits Trust amounting to 86 million 2014: 86 million to fund pension and similar liabilities in the United States see also note 17A on page 126.
SENSITIVITIES The sensitivity of the overall pension liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are: Change in assumption Change in liabilities Discount rate Increase by 0.5% -7% Inflation rate Increase by 0.5% 5% Life expectancy Increase by 1 year 4% b Long-term medical cost inflation Increase by 1.0% 1% An equivalent decrease in each assumption would have an equal and opposite impact on liabilities.
b Long-term medical cost inflation only relates to post-retirement medical plans.
The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change.
It is based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous period.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The fair value of awards at grant date is calculated using appropriate pricing models.
This value is expensed over their vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The expense is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of awards expected to vest, except where this arises from a failure to meet a market condition.
Any cancellations are recognised immediately in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83 and those for key management personnel shown in note 4A on page 99.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.
