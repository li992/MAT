In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each receivable and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivables.
The directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the provision for impairment of receivables.
The creation and releases of the provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the provision are generally written-off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
At 30 September 2015, trade receivables of 30.2m 2014: 29.8m were either partially or fully impaired.
2015 2014 The ageing of these receivables was as follows: m m Not due 7.1 4.7 Less than six months past due 5.9 7.1 More than six months past due 17.2 18.0 30.2 29.8 Trade receivables which were past their due date but not impaired at 30 September 2015 were 45.8m 2014: 33.7m.
2015 2014 The ageing of these receivables was as follows: m m Less than six months past due 41.2 31.3 More than six months past due 4.6 2.4 45.8 33.7 The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above.
The Group held no collateral as security.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of trade receivables approximated their fair value.
8.3 Trade and other payables Accounting policy Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2015 2014 restated Trade and other payables can be analysed as follows: m m Trade payables 23.3 41.5 Other tax and social security payable 41.8 52.9 Other payables 22.2 34.0 Cash held on behalf of customers see note 12.3 83.8 40.6 Accruals 140.1 110.5 311.2 279.5 In the current year, the provision balance has been disclosed separately.
9 Provisions This note provides details of the provisions recognised by the Group, where a liability exists of uncertain timing or amount.
The main estimates in this area relate to legal exposure and dilapidation charges.
This section also explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the directors in arriving at the value of these liabilities.
Accounting policy A provision is recognised only when all three of the following conditions are met: The Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event: It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation: and A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision shall be the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, i. e. the present value of the amount that the Group would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date or to transfer it to a third party.
