Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies Basis of preparation RELX PLC and RELX NV are separate, publicly held entities.
RELX PLCs ordinary shares are listed in London and New York, and RELX NVs ordinary shares are listed in Amsterdam and New York.
RELX PLC and RELX NV jointly own RELX Group plc, which, with effect from February 2015, holds all the Groups operating businesses and financing activities.
RELX PLC, RELX NV, RELX Group plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are together known as the Group.
The Governing Agreement determines the equalisation ratio between RELX PLC and RELX NV shares.
Following a bonus issue of RELX NV ordinary shares declared on 30 June 2015, one RELX PLC ordinary share confers an equivalent economic interest to one RELX NV ordinary share.
As a result of these arrangements, all shareholders can be regarded as having interests in a single economic entity.
Consequently, the Directors have concluded that the Group forms a single reporting entity for the presentation of consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, the Group consolidated financial information represents the interests of both sets of shareholders and is presented by both RELX PLC and RELX NV as their respective consolidated financial statements.
The Group consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 are unchanged from the combined financial statements previously reported, except for changes to the calculation of earnings per share as set out in note 11 on page 115.
The Directors of RELX PLC and RELX NV, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, subsidiaries of the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method.
All intra-group transactions and balances areeliminated.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, or interest in an associate or joint venture, fair values, reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition, are attributed to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets acquired.
This includes those adjustments made to bring accounting policies into line with those of the Group.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements up to or from the date that control passes from or to the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of the Group are identified separately from shareholders equity.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original acquisition and the non-controlling share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.
These financial statements form part of the statutory information to be provided by RELX PLC and RELX NV, but are not for a legal entity and do not include all the information required to be disclosed by a company in its financial statements under the UK Companies Act 2006 or the Dutch Civil Code.
Accounting policies The Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements are unchanged from the accounting policies applied in preparing the combined financial statements in the 2014 and 2013 RELX Group Annual Reports and Financial Statements, with the exception of changes to the calculation of earnings per share which is set out in note 11 on page 115.
The accounting policies under IFRS are included in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements.
