Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 13 Forestry assets continued The fair value of forestry assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy see note 30b and this category is consistent with prior years.
The fair value of forestry assets is calculated on the basis of future expected net cash flows arising on the Groups owned forestry assets, discounted based on a pre tax yield on long-term bonds over the last five years.
The following assumptions have a significant impact on the valuation of the Groups forestry assets: The net selling price, which is defined as the selling price less the costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading.
The net selling price is based on third-party transactions and is influenced by the species, maturity profile and location of timber.
In 2015, the net selling price used ranged from the South African rand equivalent of 9 per tonne to 33 per tonne 2014: 10 per tonne to 35 per tonne with a weighted average of 20 per tonne 2014: 22 per tonne.
The conversion factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber, which is dependent on the species, the maturity profile of the timber, the geographic location, climate and a variety of other environmental factors.
The discount rate of 15.2% 2014: 10.6% based on a pre tax yield from long-term South African government bonds matching the average age of the timber and adjusted for the risks associated with forestry assets.
The valuation of the Groups forestry assets is determined in rand and converted to euro at the closing exchange rate on 31 December ofeach year.
