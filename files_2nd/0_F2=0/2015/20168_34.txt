FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Operating segments are the components of the entity whose results are regularly reviewed by the entitys chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
The Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker, manages the Group on two bases.
Firstly, as business divisions determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, investment funding model and the Groups management hierarchy.
Secondly, in line with the strategy of the Group, he considers separate Proprietary Capital and Fund Management businesses focused on investment returns and Fund Management profits respectively.
A description of the activities, including products and services offered by these divisions and the allocation of resources, is given in the Strategic report.
The segmental information that follows is presented on the Investment basis which is the basis used by the Chief Executive to monitor the performance of the Group.
The remaining Notes are prepared on the IFRS basis.

7 INCOME TAXES ACCOUNTING POLICY: Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax.
Tax is charged or credited in the Statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
This may differ from the profit included in the Statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set off.
All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12 Income taxes.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

An investment trust is exempt from tax on capital gains, therefore the Groups capital return is substantially non-taxable.
Including 2 million of tax charges incurred in fair valued entities, the total tax charge for the Group was 4 million under the Investment basis presentation.

It is uncertain that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20% 2014: 20%.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 99 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 8 PER SHARE INFORMATION The calculation of basic net assets per share is based on the profit attributable to shareholders and the number of basic average shares.

The Group manages its investments with a view to profiting from the receipt of investment income and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of equity investments.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines IPEV, details of which are available in Portfolio valuation an explanation on pages 136 and 137.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair value on a different basis, in accordance with 3i Groups valuation policies.
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the principal loan balance.
The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year.
If the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a fair value reduction against any interest income accrued from the date of the assessment going forward.
Capitalisation at nil value is the term used to describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully provided for.
These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost with an equal reduction in portfolio value.
As a result of IFRS 10, and the exception from consolidation, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Groups unconsolidated subsidiaries is now presented as part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and liabilities.
A reconciliation of the fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 11.

For this reason the portfolio is classified as non-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions include 69 million 2014: 98 million in interest received by way of loan notes, of which 48 million 2014: 60 million has been valued to nil.
Included within the Statement of comprehensive income is 38 million 2014: 29 million of interest income, which reflects the net additions after write downs noted above, 14 million 2014: 6 million of cash income and the capitalisation of prior year accrued income and noncapitalised accrued income is 3 million 2014: 15 million.
Other movements include foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another, including 18 million which relates to net cash returned 2014: 21 million net cash invested from Debt Management warehouses.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 101 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 11 INVESTMENTS IN INVESTMENT ENTITIES ACCOUNTING POLICY: Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
These entities are typically Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Groups interests in investments in portfolio companies Investment Entity Holding Companies and were consolidated prior to the adoption of IFRS 10.
The fair value can increase or reduce from either cash flows to from the investment entities or valuation movements in line with the Groups valuation policy.
The fair value of these entities is their net asset values subject to any adjustments where necessary.

RESTRICTIONS 3i Group plc, the ultimate parent company, receives dividend income from its subsidiaries.
There are no significant restrictions on the ability to transfer funds from these subsidiaries to the Group.
SUPPORT 3i Group plc provides ongoing support to its investment entity subsidiaries for the purchase of portfolio investments.
During the year, the Group provided support to its unconsolidated subsidiaries, with a net cash flow as noted in the table above.
The Groups current commitments to its subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 24.
102 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12 FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACCOUNTING POLICY: Financial instruments, other than those held at amortised cost, are held at fair value and are designated irrevocably at inception.
In particular, 3i designates groups of financial instruments as being at fair value when they are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information about the groups of financial instruments is reported to management on that basis.

At 31 March 2015, 3i has invested 43 million 2014: 17 million to these warehouses and the balance is included within the Groups unquoted investments.
Of this balance, 15 million has been invested to secured debt portfolios and 28 million is held by the warehouse provider either awaiting settlement or held as cash pending a return to 3i.
For the Company, 28 million is included within the unquoted investments.
Details of the commitments and contingent liabilities in relation to these warehouses can be found in Notes 24 and 25.
B VALUATION The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values with the exception of loans and borrowings.
The fair value of the loans and borrowings is 997 million 2014: 942 million, determined with reference to their published market prices.
The carrying value of the loans and borrowings is 815 million 2014: 849 million.
Valuation hierarchy The Group classifies financial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted from active markets Quoted equity instruments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments and loan instruments Unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments can be found in the section Portfolio valuation an explanation on page 136.
The tables below show the classification of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy at 31 March 2015: Group Group Group Group Group Group Group Group 2014 2014 2014 2014 2015 2015 2015 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total restated restated restated restated m m m m m m m m Assets Quoted investments 399 399 258 258 Unquoted investments 1,272 1,272 1,324 1,324 Derivative financial instruments 2 2 Total 399 1,272 1,671 258 2 1,324 1,584 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 4 4 Total 4 4 At the Company level, the disclosures remain the same, with the exception of unquoted investments.
Unquoted investments in the Company of1,163 million 2014: 1,283 million are valued at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
This disclosure only refers to the directly held investment portfolio.
The fair value hierarchy also applies to Investments in investment entities, seeNote 11 for details.
Investments in investment entities are fair valued at the entitys net asset value with the significant part being attributable to the underlying portfolio.
The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments with any other assets or liabilities within investment entities fair valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.

The transfer of investment from Level 3 to Level 1 reflects the IPOs of Eltel and Refresco in the year.
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
On an IFRS basis, of assets held at 31 March 2015, classified as Level 3, 44% 2014: 43% were valued using a multiple of earnings and the remaining 56% 2014: 57% were valued using alternative valuation methodologies.
Valuation multiple The valuation multiple is the main assumption applied to a multiple of earnings based valuation.
The multiple is derived from comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples.
Companies in the same industry and geography and, where possible, with a similar business model and profile are selected and then adjusted for factors including liquidity risk, growth potential and relative performance.
Thevalue weighted average multiple used when valuing the portfolio was 9.68x 2014: 9.08x.
If the multiple used to value each unquoted investment valued on an earnings multiple basis as at 31 March 2015 decreased by 5%, the investment portfolio would decrease by 35 million 2014: 57 million or 2% 2014: 4%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a negative impact of 121 million 2014: 101 million or 5% 2014: 5%.
If the multiple increased by 5% then the investment portfolio would increase by 33 million 2014: 57 million or 2% 2014: 4%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact of 122 million 2014: 103 million or 6% 2014: 5%.
Alternative valuation methodologies There are a number of alternative investment valuation methodologies used by the Group, for reasons specific to individual assets.
The details of such valuation methodologies, and the inputs that are used, are given in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
Each methodology is used for a proportion of assets, by value and at year end the following techniques were used: 21% DCF, 7% Imminent sale, 10% Industry metric, 13% broker quotes and 5% other.
If the value of all of the investments under this methodology moved by 5%, this would have an impact on the investment portfolio of 35 million 2014: 29 million or 2% 2014: 2%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have an impact of 6 million 2014: 7 million or 0.3% 2014: 0.4%.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 105 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 13 CARRIED INTEREST AND PERFORMANCE FEES ACCOUNTING POLICY: Carried interest and performance fees receivable The Group earns a share of profits carried interest and performance fees receivable from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties.
These profits are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management funds.
Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable is made once the performance conditions would be achieved if the remaining assets in that fund were realised at fair value.
Fair value is determined using the Groups valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date.
An accrual is made equal to the Groups share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
The performance fee receivable from 3iN is based on 3iNs most recently published NAV subject to a performance hurdle and a high water mark.
Carried interest and performance fees payable The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments.
Carried interest and performance fees payable is the term used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest schemes.
Carried interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in that scheme were realised at fair value.
An accrual is made equal to the executives share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place in the carried interest scheme, discounted to reflect the likely actual cash payment date, which may be materially later than the time of the accrual.
The Infrastructure performance fee is accrued when we become contractually liable to make payments to the team.
Under IFRS 10, where carry payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded through Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2015, an additional 142 million of carry payable was recognised in the Statement of financial position of these investment entity subsidiaries 2014: 81 million.

106 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACCOUNTING POLICY: Fund management contracts, such as those acquired by the Group in connection with the acquisition of a subsidiary, are stated at their fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Statement of comprehensive income, included in operating expenses, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the fund management contract, typically five to 10 years.
Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of subsidiaries when the cost of acquisition exceeds the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment, and is assessed annually for impairment.

26 RETIREMENT BENEFITS ACCOUNTING POLICY: Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the Statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Interest on the net defined benefit liability asset, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation, is recognised in the income statement.
Re-measurement gains or losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds the fair value of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the balance sheet where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligations limited to the extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS i Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group.
The employees of the Groups subsidiaries in France are members of a state managed retirement benefit plan operated by the countrys government.
3i Europe plcs French branch is required to contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund these benefits.
The total expense recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is 3 million 2014: 3 million, which represents the contributions payable to these plans.
There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 113 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 26 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED ii Defined benefit plans The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK the Plan.
The Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, whose appointment is determined by the Plans documentation.
The Plan is subject to UK funding regulations, which require the Group and the Trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule where necessary.
Membership of the Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006.
The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011, although the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals.
Members of the Plan have been invited to join the Groups defined contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011.
The defined benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Companys finances and are administered by the Trustees.
The Trustees are responsible for managing and investing the Plans assets and for monitoring the Plans funding position.
As the Plan is now closed to future accrual, measures have been taken to fide-risk the Plan through changes to its investment policy.
The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2015.
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service.
3i Deutschland GmbH and the German and Spanish branches of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for their employees and have agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an employees investment policy should it arise.
The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is 1 million 2014:1 million and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is 20 million 2014: 15 million.
The amounts recognised inthe income statement for the year and other comprehensive income for these schemes are a 1 million expense 2014: 1 million expense anda 7 million expense 2014: 1 million gain respectively.

The duration of the Plans defined benefit obligation at the accounting date was around 21 years.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 115 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 26 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2015 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables allowing for improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% unchanged from 31 March2014.
The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2035 2014: 2034 is projected to be 33.4 2014: 33.3 years compared to 31.1 2014:31.0 years for someone reaching 60 in 2015.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in assumption 2015 2014 Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Increase by 12 million Increase by 9 million Retail Price Index RPI inflation Increase by 0.1% Increase by 11 million Increase by 8 million Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by 16 million Increase by 11 million The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its defined benefit plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plans assets may reduce the value of the defined benefit surplus and could affect the future funding requirements.
To reduce the volatility of the Plans assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy that reduces the Plans equity holdings by switching them to bonds over time.
The Plans assets are also diversified across different asset classes.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plans IAS 19 defined benefit obligation.
However, the Plan holds a proportion of its assets in corporate bonds and so any increase in the defined benefit obligation would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans assets.
Inflation risk The Plans defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation could reduce or eliminate the defined benefit surplus.
Life expectancy The Plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plans defined benefit obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011, the Group ceased to make regular contributions to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 was completed in March 2014.
The results of that valuation showed that the plan had an actuarial surplus of 1 million at 30 June 2013 and as a result the Group was not required to make contributions to the Plan in respect of that valuation.
The contingent asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 25, remains in place.
It is expected that the next triennial actuarial funding valuation exercise will be based on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 June 2016.
116 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICY: The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees.
Equity-settled schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the period that employees provide services, generally the period between the start of performance period and the vesting date of the shares.
The number of shares expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and services conditions included in the terms of the award will be met.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model which takes into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and any other relevant factors.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc.
The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the period.
The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
They are fair valued at each reporting date.
The cost of cash-settled share-based payment transactions are adjusted for the forfeitures of the participants rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments.
The cost of the sharebased payments is allocated either to operating expenses bonuses or carried interest depending on the original driver of the award.
Executive Director Long Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.
The total cost recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is shown below: 2015 2014 m m 1 Share awards included as operating expenses 15 6 1 Share awards included as Carried interest 4 2 Cash-settled share awards 3 2 22 10 1 Credited to equity.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 117 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED The features of the Groups share schemes for Executive Directors are described in the Report of the Board on Directors remuneration on pages 72 to 81.
To ensure that employees interests are aligned with shareholders, a significant amount of variable compensation paid to higher earning employees is deferred into shares that vest over a number of years.
For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may be granted phantom awards under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the participant to acquire shares.
The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2015 is 5 million 2014: 4 million.
For the share-based awards granted during the year, the weighted average fair value of those options at 31 March 2015 was 323 pence 2014:345 pence.
The main assumptions for the valuation of certain share-based awards with market conditions attached comprised: Expected Risk free Share price Exercise Expected option life Dividend interest Valuation methodology at issue price volatility in years Yield rate Binomial and Monte Carlo models 433.6p 34% 3 1.2% Black Scholes 401.9p 30% 3 4.6% 1.4% Expected volatility was determined from the historical three year volatility at the date of grant, commensurate with the performance period.
MOVEMENTS IN SHARE AWARDS Share-based awards have no exercise prices outstanding and the number of awards are as follows: 2015 2014 Number Number Outstanding at the start of the year 17,454,763 13,773,834 Granted 2,483,913 6,058,327 Exercised 3,141,620 1,503,366 Lapsed 780,433 874,032 Outstanding at the end of year 16,016,623 17,454,763 Weighted average remaining contractual life of awards outstanding in years 4.45 4.74 Exercisable at the end of the year 186,481 50,354 The weighted average market price at the date of exercise was 426 pence 2014: 369 pence HOLDINGS OF 3I GROUP PLC SHARES The Group has established an employee benefit trust and the total number of 3i Group plc shares held in this trust at 31 March 2015 was 24 million 2014: 27 million.
Dividend rights have been waived on these shares.
The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year end share price of 4.82 2014: 3.98 was 115 million 2014: 107 million.
118 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT INTRODUCTION A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group and both the Group and the Company share the same financial risks.
FINANCIAL RISKS Concentration risk 3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion of investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size as well as through the maturity profile of its investment portfolio.
Although 3i does not set maximum limits for asset allocation, it does have a maximum exposure limit.
This is detailed in the Investment policy on page 53 of the Directors Report.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in the Segmental analysis in Note 1 and in the 25 large investments table on pages 93 and 134. Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, derivatives, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with avariety of counterparties with 61% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA rated banks and 23% held in short-term reverse repurchase agreements with banks rated A or higher using Gilts as collateral.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with banks with a credit rating of A or higher.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on thefinancial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and isreflected through fair value movements.
The credit quality of the assets is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Further detail can be found in the Price risk market fluctuations disclosure in this Note and the sensitivity disclosure to changes in the valuation assumptions is provided in the valuation section of Note 12.
Liquidity risk Liquidity outlook is monitored weekly by management and regularly by the Board in the context of periodic strategic reviews of the balance sheet.
The new investment pipeline and forecast realisations are closely monitored and assessed against our vintage control policy.
These are noted in the risk mitigation section on page 43 of the Risk section.
The table below analyses the maturity of the Groups gross contractual liabilities.

Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate risk has primarily been managed through a reduction in gross debt.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small as the Groups outstanding debt is fixed rate.
The sensitivities below arise principally from changes in interest receivable on cash and deposit.
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12 month period, would lead to an approximate increase in total comprehensive income of 9 million 2014: 8 million increase for the Group and 8 million income 2014: 6 million for the Company.
In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and valuation of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
120 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED ii Currency risk The Groups net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and all other currencies combined is shown in the table below.
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling.
The sensitivity of the Company to foreign exchange risk is not materially different from the Group.
The Group considers currency risk on specific investment and realisation transactions and has reduced hedging on a consolidated basis over time.
Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided on page 26 in the Financial review section.

The Investment Committees role in risk management is discussed further in the Risk section.
A 15% change in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on the Statement of comprehensive income: Quoted Unquoted investment investment Total Group m m m At 31 March 2015 60 191 251 At 31 March 2014 restated 39 199 238 Quoted Unquoted investment investment Total Company m m m At 31 March 2015 60 174 234 At 31 March 2014 39 192 231 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 121 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 29 RELATED PARTIES AND INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES The Group has various related parties stemming from relationships with limited partnerships managed by the Group, its investment portfolio including unconsolidated subsidiaries, its advisory arrangements and its key management personnel.
In addition, the Company has related parties in respect of its subsidiaries.
Some of these subsidiaries are held at fair value unconsolidated subsidiaries due to the treatment prescribed in IFRS 10.
RELATED PARTIES Limited partnerships The Group manages a number of external funds which invest through limited partnerships.
Group companies act as the general partners of these limited partnerships and exert significant influence over them.

UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES The application of IFRS 12 requires additional disclosure on the Groups exposure to unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines.
These structured entities fall into four categories, namely CLOs, debt management warehouses, closed end limited partnerships Private Equity and Infrastructure funds and investments in certain portfolio investments.
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities and the maximum exposure to loss.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 123 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 29 RELATED PARTIES AND INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES CONTINUED CLO structured entities The Group manages CLO vehicles as part of its Debt Management business.
These funds predominantly invest in senior secured loans and are financed by investors seeking credit rated, structured, investment returns.
The Group manages these funds, in return for a management fee.
The Group also typically invests into the equity tranche of these funds.
The Groups attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and performance fees are accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Groups involvement with these entities are summarised below: Carrying amount Maximum loss Assets Liabilities Net exposure Balance sheet line item of asset or liability m m m m Unquoted investments 119 119 119 Fee income receivable 7 7 7 Total 126 126 126 At 31 March 2015, the total CLO assets under management were 6.5 billion 2014: 5.8 billion.
The Group earned dividend income of 16 million 2014: 8 million and fee income of 30 million 2014: 7 million during the year from CLO structured entities.
Warehouse structured entities Ahead of future CLO fund launches, warehouse facilities are usually established to support the creation of senior secured debt portfolios.
These entities are financed by the Group along with the bank appointed to operate the warehouse facility.
The Group makes a commitment to the warehouse, typically taking the first loss position and is at risk for margin calls if the portfolio underperforms.
The Groups attributable stakes in these warehouses are held at fair value.

The Group earned interest income of 6 million 2014: 2 million during the year from warehouse structured entities.
Closed end limited partnerships The Group manages a number of closed end limited partnerships, which are primarily Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in return for a management fee.
The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital appreciation.
Limited Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, finance these entities by committing capital to them and cash is drawn down or distributed for financing investment activity.
The Groups attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried interest is accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.

REGULATORY INFORMATION RELATING TO FEES: Under AIFMD, 3i Investments plc acts as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager AIFM to 3i Group plc.
In performing the activities and functions of the AIFM, the AIFM or another 3i company may pay or receive fees, commissions or non-monetary benefits to or from third parties of the following nature: Transaction fees: 3i companies receive monitoring and directors fees from portfolio companies.
The amount is agreed with the portfolio company at the time of the investment but may be re-negotiated.
Where applicable, 3i may also receive fees on the completion of transactions such as acquisitions, re-financing or syndication either from the portfolio company or a co-investor.
Transaction fees paid to 3i are included in portfolio income.
Payments for third party services: 3i companies may retain the services of third party consultants: for example for an independent director or other investment management specialist expertise.
The amount paid varies in accordance with the nature of the service and the length of the service period and is usually, but not always, paid reimbursed by the portfolio companies.
The payment may involve a flat fee, retainer or success fee.
Such payments, where borne by 3i companies, are usually included in portfolio income.
Payments for services from 3i companies: One 3i company may provide investment advisory services to another 3i company and receive payment for such service.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 125 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued 30 PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES The table below comprises the principal subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2015 all of which were wholly-owned, with the exception of 3i Debt Management Limited, which is 75.4% owned and is in turn the 100% owner of 3i Debt Management Investments Limited, and 3i Debt Management US LLC which is 80% owned.
The Group has entered into agreements to purchase the remaining 24.6% of the equity of 3i Debt Management Limited and 20% of 3i Debt Management US LLC, currently owned by management, over the next two years.
They are incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales unless otherwise stated.
The introduction of IFRS 10 has resulted in a reassessment of the accounting subsidiaries of the Group.
IFRS 10 has reduced the requirements for an entity to be classified as an accounting subsidiary and deems wider control issues, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries.
Under IFRS 10, if the Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed an accounting subsidiary.
This is inconsistent with the UK Companies Act where voting rights are the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries, with a larger than 50% holding of voting rights resulting in an entity being classified as a subsidiary.
The accounting treatment of each subsidiary is noted in the table below.
As at 31 March 2015, the entire issued share capital of 3i Holdings plc and 75.4% of the issued share capital of 3i Debt Management Limited was held by the Company.
The entire issued share capital of all the other principal subsidiary undertakings listed in the table below and 80% of 3i Debt Management US LLC was held by subsidiary undertakings of the Company.
In addition, under the application of IFRS 10, 30 of the portfolio investments are considered to be accounting subsidiaries.
As per the investment entity exception under IFRS 10, these are all held at fair value with movements shown in the Statement of comprehensive income.
The largest 25 portfolio companies by fair value are detailed on pages 134 and 135.
The combination of the table below and that on pages 134 and 135 are deemed by the Directors to fulfil the IFRS 12 disclosure of material subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that the number of undertakings in respect of which the Company is required to disclose information under Schedule4 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 is such that compliance would result ininformation of excessive length being given.
The full disclosure will be annexed to the Companys next annual return.

What we have audited We have audited the Financial statements of 3i Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2015 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of changes in equity, the Consolidated and parent Company Statements of financial position, the Consolidated and Parent Company cash flow statements and the related notes 1 to 31.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRS and, as regards the parent company Financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors responsibilities set out on pages 55 and 56, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the Financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the Financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 129 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent Auditors report continued Our assessment of risk of material misstatement and our response to these risks The risks included in the table below represent those material risks of misstatement that have had the greatest impact on our audit strategy and approach for the year ended 31 March 2015 including the allocation of resources and the directing of efforts of the engagement team.
The table also includes our audit response to each of these risks: Risk identified Our response Group and parent Company We obtained an understanding of managements processes and controls around the fair valuation of Valuation of unquoted proprietary investments and unquoted proprietary investments by performing walkthrough procedures, testing relevant controls and by resulting impact on the Consolidated statement of reviewing the valuation governance structure and protocols around managements oversight of the valuation comprehensive income of unquoted investments.

The valuation of carried interest is based on the underlying valuation of the investment portfolio.
The process of calculating carry payable and receivable requires the use of manual calculations.
The complexities inherent in the arrangements and the manual nature of the recognition process could have a significant impact on the value of carry payable and receivable and therefore on the return generated for the shareholders.
In the prior year, the Auditors report included the first time adoption of IFRS10 as a risk.
As the Group has followed the same approach to IFRS 10 this year and as there have been limited changes to the standard, IFRS10 has not been included in the risks identified above, in respect of the current year.
130 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our application of materiality We applied the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on our audit and on the Financial statements.
For the purposes of determining whether the Financial statements are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the Financial statements, would be changed or influenced.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected and undetected misstatements that we judged would be material for the Financial statements as a whole.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 38 million 2014: 33 million, which is 1% of net asset value.
Our evaluation of materiality requires professional judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative as well as quantitative considerations implicit in the definition.
We have derived our materiality calculation based on Net assets as we consider this, on balance, to be the most important financial metric used by shareholders.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgment was that overall performance materiality that is our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance for the Group should be 50% of materiality, namely 19 million 2014: 16.7 million.
Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences in the Financial statements as a whole do not exceed our materiality of 38 million.
We agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 1.9 million, 2014: 1.6 million, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluated any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
An overview of the scope of our audit We used a risk-based approach for determining our audit strategy, ensuring that our audit teams performed consistent procedures and focused on addressing the risks that are relevant to the business.
This approach focused our audit effort towards higher risk areas, such as significant management judgments.
The investments balance is the most significant part of the balance sheet.
Control over the valuation of investments, wherever they are based, isexercised directly by 3is management in London, and as such is audited by the UK based audit team.
In all locations where the Group has operations, the UK based audit team audited all items material to the Group Financial statements.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: the part of the Directors Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors report for the financial year for which the Financial statements are prepared isconsistent with the Financial statements.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent Auditors report continued Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following: Under the ISAs UK and Ireland, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial statements: or apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit: or is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from Branches not visited by us: or the parent Company Financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns: or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made: or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: the Statement of Directors Responsibilities, set out on pages 55 and 56, in relation to going concern: and the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Companys compliance with the ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

For each of our investments we have assessed whether they classify as accounting subsidiaries under IFRS and or subsidiaries under theUKCompanies Act.
This assessment forms the basis of our disclosure of accounting subsidiaries in the financial statements.
The UK Companies Act defines a subsidiary based on voting rights, with a greater than 50% majority of voting rights resulting in an entity being classified as a subsidiary.
IFRS 10 applies a wider test and, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed anaccounting subsidiary.
Accounting subsidiaries under IFRS 10 within the 25 large investments below are noted.
None of these investments areUK Companies Act subsidiaries.
In accordance with Section 29 of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive AIFMD, 3i Investments plc, as AIFM, encourages allcontrolled portfolio companies to make available to employees and investors an Annual report which meets the disclosure requirements oftheDirective.
These are available either on the portfolio companys website or through filing with the relevant local authorities.
