A convertible bond is a tradable debt that can be converted into a predetermined amount of the companys equity during its life.
In the case of Electra, on 29 December 2010 the Company issued 100 million of 5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds due 29 December 2017 at an issue price of 100 per cent and with an initial conversion price of 2,050 pence.
As a consequence of the payment of the interim dividend to ordinary shareholders on 24 July 2015, with effect from 4 June 2015 the conversion price of the Bonds was adjusted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds to 2,025 pence the conversion price being subject to adjustment to deal with certain events which would otherwise dilute the conversion of bondholders.
These events include dividends paid to ordinary shareholders, share rights and share related securities issued to shareholders, issue of other securities to shareholders, demergers and other events detailed in the Prospectus for the Bond.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds the Terms and Conditions, whereby the Company is entitled, following the satisfaction of the relevant requirements under the Terms and Conditions, to exercise its option to convert all of the outstanding Bonds into new ordinary shares, the Board has elected to exercise this option and proposes to issue the Mandatory Conversion Notice to Bond Holders in November 2015, following which, on 29 December 2015, in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the outstanding Bonds will convert into new ordinary shares when approximately 4,215,753 new ordinary shares in the Company will be issued, bringing the total number of ordinary shares in issue following the mandatory conversion to approximately 40,271,691.
The Conversion Price in respect of each Bond will be 2,025 pence.
Notwithstanding the issue of the Mandatory Conversion Notice as described above, Bond Holders remain entitled to elect to convert their Bonds into ordinary shares of the Company up to and including 29 December 2015.
In order to be entitled to the interest payment on the Bonds for the period to 29 December 2015, Bond Holders will need to be on the register of Bond Holders at the record date of 14 December 2015.

Zero Dividend Preference Shares What is a Zero Dividend Preference Share?
ZDPs are a class of share with a limited life.
They provide no annual income or dividend but instead will pay out a fixed amount of capital known as the final capital entitlement at a specific date in the future known as the redemption date.
In the case of Electra Private Equity Investments PLC EPEI, 46 million of ZDPs were raised in 2009 and have a redemption date of 5 August 2016.
Subsequent to the payment of the final capital entitlement, EPEI will have satisfied all its liabilities and the Board of Directors of EPEI are currently expecting that the Company will be voluntarily wound up to effect the payment of the final capital entitlement.
In the unlikely event of Electra winding up, the holders of ZDPs would rank above both the holders of Convertible Bonds and the ordinary shareholders in terms of being entitled to the capital of Electra.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 143 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview Share Fraud Warning We are aware that in the past a number of shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares.
These operations are commonly known as Boiler Room scams.
Please be very wary of any such calls or correspondence.
Ask for the name and organisation of the person calling you and check if they can be found on the FCA Register.
If they are not listed, please report it directly to the FCA using their consumer helpline 0800 111 6768.
You may also wish to advise us by telephoning 020 7214 4200 or emailing ir@electrapartners.
It is very unlikely that either the Company or the Companys Registrars, Equiniti, would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders.
Such calls would only relate to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never be in respect of investment advice.
Please remember that if you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong.
