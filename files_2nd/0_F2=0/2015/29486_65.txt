INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES Unconsolidated Structured Entities The Group operates investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, primarily to match unit holder liabilities.
The investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from unit holders.
Note 2 sets out the judgements inherent in determining when the Group controls, and therefore consolidates, the relevant investment vehicles.
The majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Groups investment in unconsolidated unit trusts is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities.
However, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment, with the balance being included within investments in Collective Investment Schemes.
