Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 8 Tax continued A deferred tax asset of 5.5 million 2014: 10.1 million mainly relating to contingent share awards, the pension liability and the convertible bond, was not recognised because it is uncertain whether future taxable profits will arise against which this asset can be utilised.
As a REIT, the Group is largely exempt from corporation tax in respect of its rental profits and chargeable gains relating to its property rental business.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
In particular, the Groups REIT exemption does not extend to either profits arising from the sale of investment properties which have undergone a major redevelopment within the preceding three years or profits arising from trading properties including the sale of the residential units at Rathbone Square, W1.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests including a minimum distribution test must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
