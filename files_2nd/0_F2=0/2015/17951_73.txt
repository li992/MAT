The principal restructuring activities in 2015 and 2014 are as described in note 3 e. While some elements of the non-current provisions of 35 million will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that approximately 58% will unwind in 2017 and over 93% within five years.
Employee related benefits mainly relate to long-term employee benefits other than post-employment benefits.
As the principal components of these provisions are long service awards and jubilee payments due after a certain service period, they will unwind over several years.
It is estimated that approximately 13% of the non-current provisions of 21 million will unwind within five years.
A provision of 274 million was made in 2011 for a potential claim under a 1998 settlement agreement entered into by a Group subsidiary in respect of the clean-up of sediment in the Fox River.
On 30 September 2014, the Group, NCR, Appvion and Windward Prospects entered into the Funding Agreement.
The details of this agreement are explained in note 30.
This agreement led to payments of 9 million in 2015 2014: 56 million.
In addition, the Group incurred legal costs of 8 million 2014: 7 million which were also charged against the provision.
In light of the conclusion of the Funding Agreement, the sums that the Group agreed to pay thereunder, as well as the available information in relation to the extent of the clean-up related costs, the Group reviewed the Fox River provision and 27 million was released from the provision in 2014.
It is expected that the non-current provision will unwind within five years.
Other provisions comprise balances set up in the ordinary course of general business that cannot be classified within the other categories, such as sales returns, onerous contracts, together with amounts in respect of supplier, excise and other disputes.
The nature of the amounts provided in respect of disputes is such that the extent and timing of cash flows is difficult to estimate and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided.
Amounts provided above are shown net of reversals of unused provisions which include reversals of 18 million 2014: 18 million for restructuring of existing businesses, nil 2014: nil for employee benefits and 6 million 2014: 17 million for other provisions.
