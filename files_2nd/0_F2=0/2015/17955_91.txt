We disagree with the CATs judgment and have applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
Ofcom had determined that BT had overcharged for certain services between 1 April 2006 and 31{March 2011 and required BT to make repayments.
The CAT judged that BT should also pay interest on these amounts.
