On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, including segmental information, exceptional items, taxation and earnings per share.
2.1 Segmental information Reported revenues and profits for the Group are stated before exceptional items as presented in the consolidated income statement.
Organic revenue growth and operating profit are the two short-term key performance indicators or measures that reflect the way the performance of the Group is managed and monitored by the Executive Committee.
In this section the key constituents of these two KPIs, being the Groups revenues and segmental operating profits, are analysed by reference to the performance and activities of the Groups segments and their operating costs.
Organic revenue growth is the growth in segmental revenues on a like-for-like basis excluding the effects of acquisitions, disposals and exchange rate movements.
1 Segmental information Segmental information is presented in the consolidated financial statements for each of the Groups operating segments.
The operating segment reporting format reflects the Groups management and internal reporting structures and represents the information that was presented to the chief operating decision-maker, being the Executive Committee.
As described on page 2, each of the Groups three divisions has a number of key brands across its main markets and operational locations.
For the purposes of reportable segmental information, operating segments are aggregated into the Groups three divisions, as the nature of the products, production processes and types of customer are similar within each division.
Continuing operations Corporate costs In 2014 and prior years corporate costs were allocated to each of the divisions IMI Critical Engineering to arrive at segmental operating profit.

91 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 2.3 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per share EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share excluding those held in the Employee Benefit Trust or by the Company.
Basic EPS measures are calculated as the Group profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of all outstanding share options priced below the market price, in arriving at the number of shares used in its calculation.
Both of these measures are also presented on an adjusted basis, to remove the effects of exceptional items, being items of both income and expense which are sufficiently large, volatile or one-off in nature to assist the reader of the financial statements to get a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.

5 Reconciliation of effective tax rate As IMIs head office and parent company is domiciled in the UK, the Group references its effective tax rate to the UK corporation tax rate, despite only a small proportion of the Groups business being in the UK.
Therefore, the following tax reconciliation applies the UK corporation tax rate for the year to profit before tax, both before and after exceptional items.
This resulting tax charge is reconciled to the actual tax charge for the Group, by taking account of specific tax adjustments as follows: 2015 2014 Before Exceptional Before Exceptional exceptionals items Total exceptionals items Total m m m m m m Profit before tax from continuing operations 218.7 56.0 162.7 278.1 32.4 245.7 Profit before tax from discontinued operations section 2.5 5.3 5.3 - 481.0 481.0 Profit before tax 218.7 50.7 168.0 278.1 448.6 726.7 Income tax using the Companys domestic rate of tax of 20.25% 2014: 21.5% 44.3 10.3 34.0 59.8 96.4 156.2 Effects of: Non-deductible items 2.7 1.5 4.2 2.9 4.7 7.6 Non-taxable loss profit on disposal of businesses 0.1 0.5 0.6 - 108.0 108.0 Release of deferred tax asset 1.0 1.6 2.6 - - - Utilisation of losses on which no deferred tax had been recognised 2.6 - 2.6 - - - Current year losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised 3.2 - 3.2 1.3 - 1.3 Change in future tax rate on UK deferred tax 5.5 - 5.5 - - - Differing tax rates 0.1 3.5 3.4 0.8 1.7 0.9 Under over provided in prior years 4.8 0.1 4.9 3.6 2.8 0.8 Total tax in income statement section 2.4 48.1 10.1 38.0 61.2 5.8 55.4 Income tax expense reported in the consolidated income statement 48.1 8.7 39.4 61.2 8.3 52.9 Effective rate of tax continuing operations : 22.0% 24.2% 22.0% 21.5% Income tax attributable to discontinued operations section 2.5 1.4 1.4 2.5 2.5 Effective rate of tax discontinued operations : -26.4% 0.5% Total tax in income statement section 2.4 48.1 10.1 38.0 61.2 5.8 55.4 Effective rate of tax total Group : 22.0% 22.6% 22.0% 7.6% 94 IMI plc SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR Continued 2.4.

8 Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets of 48.9m 2014: 39.8m have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of 32.8m 2014: 16.1m, interest of 59.0m 2014: 40.4m and capital losses of 123.2m 2014: 113.3m.
The majority of the tax losses have no expiry date.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for these temporary differences due to uncertainty over their offset against future taxable profits and therefore their recoverability.
It is likely that the majority of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption.
However 74.3m 2014: 81.7m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability principally as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 5.3m 2014: 8.1m, of which 4.7m 2014: 2.0m has been provided on the basis that the Group expects to remit these amounts.
The balance has not been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of dividends and does not expect to pay up these amounts in the foreseeable future.
2.5 Discontinued operations When the Group has assets and liabilities that are likely to be sold rather than being held for continuing use and when accounting standards require, these assets and liabilities are included in current assets and liabilities and denoted held for sale rather than in their usual categories.
If they represent a significant enough proportion of the Group, they are also treated as discontinued operations.
This means that their trading performance, i. e. their revenues, costs and other items of income and expense, are no longer reported within the headline figures in the income statement and are instead reported in a separate line, net of tax, called discontinued operations.
These amounts no longer form part of continuing earnings per share.
Comparative figures are restated to be shown on the same basis.
This enables the income statement for the current and prior year to be presented on a consistent basis and to convey a more forward-looking version of the results for the year.
A pre-tax and post-tax gain of 4.4m was recognised in the current year as a result of the finalisation of a number of matters relating to the disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses, which were sold on 1 January 2014 and a pre-tax gain of 0.9m and post-tax gain of 2.3m relating to other discontinued operations.
The prior year comparative includes a post-tax gain on disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses of 477.5m and a pre-tax and post-tax gain of 1.0m relating to other discontinued operations.
96 IMI plc SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES What you will find in this section This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in Section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in Section 2.4.
On the following pages there are sections covering working capital, non-current assets, acquisitions, other payables due after more than one year, provisions and pensions.
2 Working capital Trade and other receivables 2015 2014 Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates m m through its trading activities.
The Group therefore defines working capital as trade and other receivables, inventory and trade and other payables.
Current Working capital is managed very carefully to ensure that the Group can Trade receivables 291.3 318.0 meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
Other receivables 39.8 34.8 To provide the Executive Committee with insight into the management Prepayments and accrued income 20.3 16.1 of working capital, an important measure monitored is cash conversion.
351.4 368.9 Cash conversion is defined as the operating cash flow as defined in the Receivables are stated after: commentary on the cash flow statement divided by the segmental operating Allowance for impairment 8.9 7.1 profit which therefore represents the proportion of segmental operating profit generated during the year that has been converted into cash.
The reduction in the Groups trade and other receivables of 18m is due to favourable cash movements of 29m and foreign exchange movements of 3.1.
1 6m, partially offset by an increase of 17m following the acquisitions and disposals in the year.
Inventories The Groups exposure to credit and market risks related to trade and other receivables is disclosed in section 4.4.
3 Raw materials and consumables 78.8 87.0 Work in progress 99.7 71.9 Trade and other payables Finished goods 54.8 67.4 233.3 226.3 2015 2014 m m In 2015 the cost of inventories recognised as an expense being segmental Current cost of sales amounted to 866.7m 2014: 919.6m.
The Groups inventory Trade payables 171.2 164.4 increased by 7m due to an increase of 7m following the acquisitions and Social security and other taxation 21.1 26.1 disposals in the year and a further increase of 4m due to an increase in Other payables 5.9 7.5 inventory of 13m within Critical Engineering, reflecting the timing of orders Accruals and deferred income 143.9 135.9 and customer shipments, partially offset by inventory reductions in Precision 342.1 333.9 Engineering and Hydronic Engineering of 6m and 3m respectively as a result of lean initiatives.
These increases were partially offset by a 4m reduction due Non-current to foreign exchange movements.
Other payables 24.2 28.2 In 2015 the write-down of inventories to net realisable value amounted to 5.8m 366.3 362.1 2014: 7.9m.
The reversal of write-downs amounted to 2.5m 2014: 3.9m.
Write-downs and reversals in both years relate to on-going assessments of The Groups trade and other payables increased by 4m due to an increase of inventory obsolescence, excess inventory holding and inventory resale 11m following the acquisitions and disposals in the year and movements in values across all of the Groups businesses.
These increases were partially offset by cash movements of 7m and foreign exchange movements of 4m.
97 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 3.2 Intangible assets The following section shows the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include goodwill, customer relationships, order books, patents, development costs and software development costs.
The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid for them or, when they have arisen due to a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
In the case of goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual assets net of the liabilities acquired.
The value of the goodwill can arise from a number of sources, but in relation to our more recent acquisitions, it has been represented by post-acquisition synergies and the skills and knowledge of the workforce.
The value of the Groups intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the number of years over which the Group expects to use the asset, the useful life, via an annual amortisation charge to the income statement.
The Group splits its intangible assets between those arising on acquisitions and those which do not, because the amortisation of acquired intangibles meets the definition of an exceptional item as described in section 2.2.
Where there are indications that the value of intangible assets is no longer representative of their value to the Group, for example where there is a customer relationship recognised but revenues from that customer are reducing, or where goodwill was recognised on an acquisition but the performance of the business acquired is below expectations, the directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their amortised values.
If this has happened, a one-off impairment charge is recognised.
This section explains the overall carrying values of the intangible assets within the Group and the specific judgements and estimates made by the directors in arriving at these values.
2 Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is not subject to an annual amortisation charge.
Instead, its carrying value is assessed annually by comparison to the future cash flows of the business to which it relates the cash generating unit, or CGU.
These cash flows are discounted to reflect the time value of money and this discount rate, together with the growth rates assumed in the cash flow forecasts, are the key assumptions in this impairment testing process.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs based on the synergies 2015 2014 expected to be derived from the acquisition upon which the goodwill arose.
The % % Group has 20 cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated, compared Pre-tax discount rate 9.9 16.2 9.8 16.4 to 24 in the prior year.
The change in the composition of CGUs follows changes in both the way in which cash inflows are generated and the internal reporting Long-term growth rate 1.0 2.1 1.0 3.8 structure.
Where our businesses operate closely with each other we will continue to review whether they should be treated as a single or combined CGU.
For the purpose of assessing the significance of CGUs, the Group uses a threshold of 20% of the total goodwill balance.
Goodwill of 78.4m associated Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as part of the overall assessment of with the Control Valves CGU in Critical Engineering is considered to be assets against their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is significant.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from a value the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use valuation are determined using cash flow projections from financial budgets, forecasts and the discount rate, growth rate and operating cashflows.
These estimates are plans approved by the Board covering a five-year period and include a terminal determined using the methodology discussed above.
The discount rate applied value multiple.
The projected cash flows reflect the latest expectation for Control Valves is 12.5% and a growth rate of 1.6% is applied into perpetuity.
of demand for products and services.
No other CGUs have goodwill that is considered significant in the context The key assumptions in these calculations are the long-term growth rates and of the Groups total goodwill balance, nor do any CGUs use the same key the discount rates applied to forecast cash flows in addition to the achievement assumptions for the purposes of impairment testing in either this year or of the forecasts themselves.
Long-term growth rates are based on long-term the last.
economic forecasts for growth in the manufacturing sector in the geographical regions in which the cash generating unit operates.
Pre-tax discount rates The aggregate amount of goodwill arising from acquisitions prior to 1 January specific to each cash generating unit are calculated by adjusting the Group 2004 which had been deducted from the profit and loss reserves and post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 8% 2014: 9% for the incorporated into the IFRS transitional balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, tax rate relevant to the jurisdiction before adding risk premia for the size of the amounted to 364m.

regions from which the cash flows are derived.
This exercise resulted in the use of the following ranges of values for the key assumptions: 99 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 3.3 Property, plant and equipment The following section concerns the physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include manufacturing, distribution and office sites, as well as equipment used in the manufacture of the Groups products.
The cost of these assets represents the amount initially paid for them.
With the exception of the Groups land and assets under construction which have not yet been brought into use, a depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect the annual wear and tear and the reduction in the value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by reference to the assets useful lives, by estimating the number of years over which the Group expects the asset to be used.
As we do for our intangible assets see section 3.2, if there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value, a one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
The recoverable amount of these assets has been determined using their fair value less costs to sell, estimated by both internal and external valuation specialists.
Group contracts in respect of future capital expenditure which had been placed at the balance sheet date relating to the continuing business amounted to 6.9m 2014: 7.6m.
Included in the total net book value of plant and equipment is 0.7m 2014: 1.0m in respect of assets acquired under finance leases.
Depreciation for the year on these assets was 0.3m 2014: 0.3m.
100 IMI plc SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Continued 3.4 Acquisitions The following section discusses businesses acquired by the Group, which have given rise to the additions to the acquired intangible assets including goodwill reported in section 3.2 and which contributed to the Groups profits, working capital and other balance sheet assets and liabilities.
On 2 January 2015, the Group acquired the entire share capital of B&R Holding GmbH Bopp & Reuther for a cash consideration of 109.2m 140.8m.
Bopp & Reuther is a leading manufacturer of safety, control and shut-off valve technology for process industries as well as conventional fossil and nuclear power plants worldwide.
Its head office and manufacturing plant is located in Mannheim, Germany and it has service centres in Germany, Austria, Romania and China.
The senior management team and all of its approximately 400 employees transferred upon completion of the acquisition by the Group.
Bopp & Reuther joins the IMI Critical Engineering division and over the course of the year has been effectively integrated into its control valve business CCI.
The final fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below: m Customer relationships 43.9 Order book 9.3 Brand 11.4 Property, plant and equipment 4.2 Other intangibles - software 1.0 Inventories 10.4 Trade and other receivables 21.1 Cash and cash equivalents 3.0 Interest-bearing liabilities and borrowings 8.6 Trade and other payables 14.9 Taxation balances 20.3 Employee benefit obligations 4.4 Other assets 0.6 Total identifiable net assets 56.7 Goodwill arising on acquisition 52.5 Total purchase consideration 109.2 Cash flows from the acquisition of controlling interests are shown below: m Cash consideration 109.2 Net cash and cash equivalents acquired 3.0 Net cash paid on acquisition 106.2 Acquisition costs included in cash flows from operating activities 1.8 Total cash flow on acquisition of controlling interests 108.0 The goodwill recognised is primarily attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the assets and activities of Bopp & Reuther with those of the Group.
The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition costs of 2.2m were incurred in 2014 and were recorded as an exceptional item in the income statement.
The cash flows associated with these acquisition costs in 2015 are shown in the table above.
At the date of the acquisition, the fair value and gross amount of the trade receivables was 21.1m.
At 31 December 2015, 0.1m of the trade receivables have been impaired.
From the date of acquisition, Bopp & Reuther has contributed 46m of revenue and a profit of 1.3m to the operating profit of the Group.
In addition, the effective integration of Bopp & Reuther within IMI Critical Engineerings existing large control valve business has resulted in strong revenue synergies elsewhere within the Group.
101 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 3.5 Disposals Disposals in the current year During the year, the Group disposed of Asterm SAS Asterm, IMI Scott Limited Scott, Zimmerman & Jansen South Africa Pty.
Ltd Z&J SA and the non-core elements of Nano Porous Solutions Limited NPSL, with the remainder of the NPSL business being transferred to Norgren UK.
These disposals resulted in losses of 8.8m and with the exception of Asterm, are presented in the income statement as an exceptional item as, based on their quantum, they meet our definition of exceptional items.

Eley The Group disposed of Eley Limited, Accles and Shelvoke Limited and Eley Americas Inc together Eley on 4 October 2014 for proceeds of 41.6m resulting in a gain on disposal for the Group of 33.1m, after disposing of 6.5m of net assets and incurring 2.0m of associated costs.
AFP The Group disposed of Mecanique Analytique Inc trade name AFP on 23 October 2014 for proceeds of 3.4m resulting in a gain on disposal for the Group of 1.1m, after disposing of 1.3m of net assets and incurring 1.0m of associated costs.
The gains on disposal of Eley and AFP were presented in the income statement as an exceptional item.
They were not disclosed as discontinued operations because they did not represent a separate major line of business.
102 IMI plc SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Continued 3.6 Provisions A provision is recorded instead of a payable see section 3.1.
3 when there is less certainty over how much cash will be paid and when the payment might be made.
When the Group has an obligation relating to previous events and when it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it, a provision rather than a payable is recorded.
In this situation, an estimate is required.
The principal estimates made in respect of the Groups provisions concern the timing and amount of payments required to: cover the costs of known restructuring projects: reimburse customers for potential product warranty claims: ensure that current and former manufacturing sites meet relevant environmental standards: reflect the estimated outcome of ongoing legal disputes: and provide against indemnities following the disposal of subsidiaries.
Analysis of the Groups provisions: Environmental, Trade legal & Restructuring warranties indemnity Total m m m m Current 4.4 6.9 11.4 22.7 Non-current 1.2 7.4 7.8 16.4 At 1 January 2015 5.6 14.3 19.2 39.1 Arising during the year 24.4 2.6 4.7 22.3 Utilised during the year 16.4 1.3 0.3 18.0 Exchange adjustment 0.2 0.1 0.5 0.8 At 31 December 2015 13.4 15.5 13.7 42.6 Current 12.5 9.3 3.3 25.1 Non-current 0.9 6.2 10.4 17.5 13.4 15.5 13.7 42.6 The restructuring provision reflects residual amounts committed but not spent in relation to a number of specific projects.
Trade warranties are given in the normal course of business and cover a range of periods, typically one to two years, with the expected amounts falling due in less than and greater than one year separately analysed above.
Amounts set aside represent the directors best estimate regarding the amount of the settlements and the timing of resolution with customers.
Environmental and legal provisions recognise the Groups obligation to remediate contaminated land at a number of current and former sites, together with current legal cases for which a settlement is considered probable.
Because of the long-term nature of the liabilities, the timescales are uncertain and the provisions represent the directors best estimates of these costs.
Provisions for indemnities included in the agreed terms of disposals of subsidiaries are provided for based on the expected probability of indemnified losses that may be suffered by the purchaser.
103 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING COSTS What you will find in this section This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The directors determine the appropriate capital structure for the Group, specifically, how much cash is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
The directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business plan.
The Board is mindful that equity capital cannot be easily flexed and in particular raising new equity would normally be likely only in the context of an acquisition.
Debt can be issued and repurchased more easily but frequent adjustments lead to high transaction costs and debt holders are under no obligation to accept repurchase offers.
4.1 Net debt Net debt is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total outstanding debt, net of the current cash resources.

The Group Assurance department undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

Geographically there is no unusual concentration of credit risk.
The Groups contract approval procedure ensures that large contracts are signed off at executive director level at which time the risk profile of the contract, including potential credit and foreign exchange risks, is reviewed.
Credit risk is minimised through due diligence on potential customers, appropriate credit limits, cash flow management and the use of documentary credits where appropriate.

3 Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the Groups income and cash flows or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Under the management of the central treasury function, the Group enters into derivatives in the ordinary course of business and also manages financial liabilities in order to mitigate market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board and are undertaken only if they relate to underlying exposures.

Exchange contracts and non-sterling debt are financial instruments used as currency hedges of overseas net assets.
3.2 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to a number of global interest rates through assets and liabilities denominated in jurisdictions to which these rates are applied, most notably US, Eurozone and UK rates.
The Group is exposed to these because market movements in these rates will increase or decrease the interest charge recognised in the Group income statement.
a Management of interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of maintaining a portion of its liabilities at fixed interest rates and reviewing the balance of the floating rate exposure to ensure that if interest rates rise globally the effect on the Groups income statement is manageable.
Interest rates are managed using fixed and floating rate debt and financial instruments including interest rate swaps.
Floating rate liabilities comprise short-term debt which bears interest at short-term bank rates and the liability side of exchange contracts where the interest element is based primarily on three month inter-bank rates.
All cash surpluses are invested for short periods and are treated as floating rate investments.
Non-interest bearing financial assets and liabilities including short-term trade receivables and payables have been excluded from the following analysis.

6 Fair value Financial instruments included in the financial statements are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
The Group generally calculates its own fair values using comparable observed market prices and a valuation model using the respective and relevant market data for the instrument being valued.
6.1 Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out the Groups accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities, and their fair values at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
Under IAS39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes and transacts all derivatives with suitable investment grade counterparties.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.

Derivative liabilities designated at fair value represent the fair value of net investment hedge derivatives.
The decrease in value of net investment hedge derivatives from an asset to a liability in the year of 11.0m is shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income net of tax.
There are no other financial liabilities included within payables disclosed above and finance leases disclosed in section 4.4.

Valuation techniques for level 2 inputs Derivative assets and liabilities of 2.8m and 8.9m respectively are valued by level 2 techniques.
The valuations are derived from discounted contractual cash flows using observable, and directly relevant, market interest rates and foreign exchange rates from market data providers.
Valuation techniques for level 3 inputs The Group has no financial assets or financial liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable level 3 inputs.
6.2 Valuation methodology Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, trade payables and trade receivables are carried at their book values as this approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
Long-term and short-term borrowings, apart from any which are subject to hedging arrangements, are carried at amortised cost as it is the intention that they will not be repaid prior to maturity, where this option exists.
The fair values are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates and relevant credit spreads.
Long-term borrowings which are subject to hedging arrangements are valued using appropriate discount rates to value the relevant hedged cash flows.
Derivative assets and liabilities, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and metal hedges, are valued using comparable observed market prices and a valuation model using foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves for the underlying commodities.
Investments are primarily in publically-quoted pooled funds held to fund overseas pension liabilities.
The fair value is determined by the unadjusted price quotation at the reporting date.

6.3 Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
7 Market risk sensitivity analysis on financial instruments This section shows how the fair value of financial instruments presented can change for a given change in market rates.
The values shown in the table below are estimates of the impact on financial instruments only.
The underlying risks that these financial instruments have been acquired to hedge will move in an opposite direction.
7.1 Overview In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax and equity.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.
7.2 Financial derivatives sensitivity table The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur only to the financial derivatives and do not reflect the opposite movement from the impact of the specific change on the underlying business that they are designed to hedge.

There is a significant degree of estimation involved in predicting the ultimate benefits payable under these defined benefit arrangements in respect of which the Group holds net liabilities on its balance sheet.
This section explains how the value of these benefits payable and any assets funding the arrangements are accounted for in the Group financial statements and gives details of the key assumptions upon which the estimations are based.
Assets and liabilities for defined contribution arrangements are minimal as they relate solely to short-term timing differences between the period during which benefits have accrued and when contributions are paid into schemes.
Defined contribution DC : Arrangements where the employer pays fixed contributions into an external fund on behalf of the employee who is responsible for making the investment decision and therefore assumes the risks and rewards of fund performance.
Contributions to these arrangements are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit DB : A defined benefit pension plan is a pension arrangement in which the employer promises a specified annual benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employees earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.
In some cases, this benefit is paid as a lump sum on leaving the Company or while in the service of the Company rather than as a pension.
The Group underwrites one or more risks in meeting these obligations and therefore any net liability or surplus in these arrangements is shown on the Group balance sheet.

The assets and liabilities of the schemes are aggregated, recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and shown within non-current liabilities or in non-current assets if a scheme is in surplus and it is recoverable.
Number of defined benefit arrangements: 63 2014: 64 During the year, following the acquisition of Bopp & Reuther, the Group took on the Bopp & Reuther Pension & Jubilee plans and also recognised the CCI Long Service Plan in Australia.
The Group fully settled the IMI Americas inc & CCI inc Pension plans and the Asterm retirement indemnity plan, following disposal.

These assumptions include the discount rate applied to the assets and liabilities, the life expectancy of the members, their expected salary and pension increases and inflation.
The assumptions used for this purpose in these financial statements are summarised below: Weighted Averages 31 Dec 2015 31 Dec 2014 31 Dec 2013 UK Overseas UK Overseas UK Overseas % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Inflation - RPI 3.1 n a 3.1 n a 3.5 n a Inflation - CPI 2.1 1.5 2.1 1.7 2.5 1.8 Discount rate 3.7 1.7 3.6 2.1 4.5 3.3 Expected salary increases 2.5 1.7 n a 2.2 n a 2.3 Rate of pension increases 3.1 0.4 3.1 0.3 3.5 0.5 119 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 2015 2014 2013 Years Years Years Life expectancy at age 65 UK Funds only Current male pensioners 21.1 21.2 21.0 Current female pensioners 24.0 24.0 23.9 Future male pensioners 23.2 23.0 22.8 Future female pensioners 26.3 26.0 25.9 The mortality assumptions used for the UK Funds above reflect its scheme specific experience, together with an allowance for improvements over time.
The experience was reviewed as part of the formal triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2014, and the assumptions used as at 31 December 2015 and 2014 reflect the results of this review.
The table below left illustrates how the UK Funds net pension surplus would decrease excluding the impact of inflation rate and interest rate hedging, as at 31 December 2015, in the event of the following reasonable changes in the key assumptions above.
The table below right shows how the net pension deficit for IMIs non-UK plans would increase, in the event of the following reasonable changes in the key assumptions above.

The estimated cost of awarding these share options is charged to the income statement over the period that the Group benefits from the employees services.
This cost is then added back to retained earnings, to reflect that there is no overall impact on the Groups balance sheet until the shares are issued to the employees when the options are exercised.
The individual share option schemes, the number of options outstanding under each of them, the estimated cost of these options recognised in the income statement and the assumptions used in arriving at this estimated cost are described in this section.

spite of this control, when other parties have an interest in the operation, that interest should be reflected.

Further information These assumptions, accompanied by sensitivity analysis thereon, are included on this process and the assets affected is included in section 3.2. in section 4.5.
Due to the complexity of the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
