Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2015 continued 4.
Investment Income Accounting policy Interest income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date.
Interest income is recognised gross of withholding tax, if any.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but excludes future credit losses.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised gross of withholding tax in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on the date the right to receive payment is established.
This is the date when the Directors of the underlying project entity approve the payment of a dividend.
Net gain from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Net gain from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes including foreign exchange movements other than interest and dividend income recognised separately.
