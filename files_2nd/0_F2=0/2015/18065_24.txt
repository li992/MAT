S TRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 181 181 Gas and Liquids Reserves Unaudited The Groups estimates of reserves of gas and liquids are reviewed as part of the full year reporting process and updated accordingly.
A number of factors affect the volumes of gas and liquids reserves, including the available reservoir data, commodity prices and future costs.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
The Group discloses 2P gas and liquids reserves, representing the central estimate of future hydrocarbon recovery.
Reserves for Centrica operated fields are estimated by in-house technical teams composed of geoscientists and reservoir engineers.
Reserves for non-operated fields are estimated by the operator, but are subject to internal review and challenge.
As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, an assessment of the reserves, including the application of the reserves definitions is undertaken by an independent technical auditor.
An annual reserves assessment has been carried out by DeGoyler and MacNaughton for the Groups global reserves.
Reserves are estimated in accordance with a formal policy and procedure standard.
The Group has estimated 2P gas and liquids reserves in Europe, Canada and Trinidad and Tobago.
The principal fields in Europe are Kvitebjorn, Statfjord, Cygnus, South Morecambe, Maria, Chiswick, Valemon, Butch and Rhyl.
The principal field in Trinidad and Tobago is NCMA-1.
The principal field in Centrica Storage is the Rough field.
The European and Trinidad and Tobago reserves estimates are consistent with the guidelines and definitions of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and the World Petroleum Councils Petroleum Resources Management System using accepted principles.
The principal fields in Canada are Panther, Wildcat Hills, Alderson, Stolberg, Hanlan and Ferrier.
The Canadian field reserves estimates have been evaluated in accordance with the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook COGEH reserves definitions and are consistent with the guidelines and definitions of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the World Petroleum Council.

ii The Trinidad and Tobago reserves are subject to a production sharing contract and accordingly have been stated on an entitlement basis including tax barrels.
iii Revision of previous estimates including those associated with Statfjord, Kvitebjorn, Butch, Valemon, Grove and Galleon areas in Europe: the Peace River Arch and Hanlan Robb areas in Canada and NCMA-1 in Trinidad and Tobago.
iv Reflects the disposal of Craigmyle and Endiang assets during the year.
v Recognition of reserves including the addition of 81 development locations in Canada.
vi Represents total sales volumes of gas and oil produced from the Groups reserves.
In August 2015, Centrica Storage gained consent from the Oil and Gas Authority OGA to convert 15 bcf of cushion gas to working gas.
By 31 December 2015, 6 bcf had been converted deemed production with the remainder expected to be converted in 2016. vii Includes the total of estimated gas and liquids reserves at 31 December 2015 in million barrels of oil equivalent.
Liquids reserves include oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.
