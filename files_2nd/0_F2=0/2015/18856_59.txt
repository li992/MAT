John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 89 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Acquisitions continued Contingent consideration has been provided in relation to all four of the acquisitions and is payable over the next three years.
The amount payable is dependent on the post-acquisition profits of the acquired entities and the provision made is based on the Groups estimate of the likely profits of those entities.
Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Due to its size, the acquisition of the Infinity Group is considered material and has been presented separately in the table above.
The other acquisitions are not considered to be material on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated above.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Groups wider client base and use the Groups resources to further grow and develop their businesses.
The acquisitions expand the Groups existing service lines and provide increased diversification and entry into new markets.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions.
The acquisition of Infinity gives the Group access to the downstream market and provides a platform to grow geographically into other US markets.
Intangible assets of $77.4m, representing the fair value of customer contracts and relationships, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions made in the year.
Provisional fair value adjustments of $11.5m have also been recorded.
Trade and other receivables acquired of $151.4m are expected to be recovered in full.
The accounting for these acquisitions will be finalised in the next accounting period.

Acquisition costs incurred in relation to the companies acquired during the year are included in administrative expenses in the income statement.
