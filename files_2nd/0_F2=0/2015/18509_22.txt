Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered ofce is 395 King Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic report on pages 6 to 54.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
2 significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors report on pages 103 to 104.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The gures for the year to 31 March 2015 include the results of the rail business for the year to 31 March 2015 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 28 March 2015.
The gures for the year to 31 March 2014 include the results of the rail businesses for the year to 31 March 2014 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2014.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identied separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of their fair value of the acquirees identiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis.
Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, with the exception of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements, liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payment and non-current assets or disposal groups that are classied as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair valueof the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 111 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 significant accounting policies continued Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant inuence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
significant inuence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
As a general rule, significant inuence will be presumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% ormore of the voting power, of the investee.
However, where it is clear that the Group, although holding 20% or more of the voting power does not have significant inuence, the investment is not accounted for as an associate.
The Group has a 30% holding in DSBFirst but does not have significant inuence and therefore the holding is treated as an investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classied as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Thiscondition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the dateof classication.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs which are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on thebasis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit orloss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being testedfor impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included indetermining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
The existing nite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their useful economic lives as follows: Customer contracts over the estimated life of the contract 9 to 10 years Greyhound brand and trade name over the estimated life of the brand 20 years Franchise agreements over the initial term of the franchise 2 to 10 years.
In the event of a franchise extension a new intangible asset is set up and is amortised over the term of the extension on a straight-line basis.
Revenue recognition Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services in the UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as the proportion of total services to be provided.
Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within Season ticket deferred income and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and Transport Scotland and amounts receivable under franchise revenue support arrangements.
Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
112 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 2 significant accounting policies continued UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts are recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority.
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises of amounts receivable from ticket sales.
Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, andservices revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the lifeof thelease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve aconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies see note 23 for details of the Groups policies in respect of foreign exchange risks.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates uctuate signicantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take asubstantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Non-GAAP measures and performance In measuring the Group adjusted performance, additional financial measures derived from the reported results have been used in order to eliminate factors which distort year on year comparisons.
The Groups adjusted performance is used to explain year on year changes when the effect of certain items are significant, including amortisation, business disposals, aged legal claims and revisions to onerous contracts, as management consider that this basis more appropriately reects operating performance and a better understanding of the key performance indicators of the business.
See note 4 for the reconciliation to non-GAAP measures and performance.
Subsequent revisions to adjusting items are also recognised as an adjusting item in future periods.
In the current year non-GAAP adjusting items principally relate to amortisation charges, gain on disposal of property, aged legal claims associated with previous acquisitions, the impairment of a number of Group IT licences and business disposals.
In the prior year the non-GAAP adjusting items principally related to amortisation charges and business disposals.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 significant accounting policies continued Retirement benefit costs The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both dened benefit schemes and dened contribution schemes.
Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions into a dened contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benets relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For dened benefit schemes, the cost of providing benets is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benets are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
The retirement benefit position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Various TOCs in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide dened benefit scheme.
The Group is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held.
The full liability is recognised on the balance sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reects the Groups obligations to fund the scheme over the franchise term.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheetdate.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities andwhen they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a netbasis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
114 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 2 significant accounting policies continued Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight-line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight-line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 17 years straight-line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight-line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Capital grants Capital grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Capital grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classication of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassication event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash ows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classied into one of four primary categories: Fair value through profit and loss This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 significant accounting policies continued Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments and xed maturity are classied here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i. e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as dened for the cash ow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the Groups UK Rail subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classied in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Sterling bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty conrmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash ow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred tothe income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or lossesreported in the income statement.
116 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 2 significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals.
Self-insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
In addition there are typically a smaller number of major claims during a financial year which might be subject to an insurance deductible.
To provide protection against these major losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value atthe date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations for annual periods beginning on or after the effective dates as noted below: Effective for accounting periods IAS IFRS standards starting on or after 1 Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 December 2015 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016 1 Amendments to IAS 1 December 2015 Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2016 1 Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 September 2014 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its 1 January 2016 Associate or Joint Venture 1 Amendments to IAS 27 August 2014 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016 1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 1 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017 1 Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 May 2014 clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and 1 January 2016 Amortisation 1 Amendments to IFRS 11 May 2014 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016 2 Amendments to IAS 19 November 2013 Dened benefit Plans: Employee Contributions 1 July 2014 3 IFRIC 21 Levies 1 January 2014 1 The mandatory adoption under EU adopting regulations has not yet been confirmed.
2 Mandatory for accounting periods starting on or after 1 February 2015 under EU adopting regulations.
3 Mandatory for accounting periods starting on or after 17 June 2014 under EU adopting regulations.
The Directors do not anticipate the adoption of these other standards will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initialapplication.
Adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations which have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements the standard establishes the principles for the presentation of consolidated accounts when an entity controls one or more other entities.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements the standard determines the type of joint arrangement by assessing the rights and obligations, and accounts for those rights and obligations in accordance with that type of joint arrangement.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities the standard sets out the requirements to disclose information that enables users of accounts to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other entities and the effects of these interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash ows.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 significant accounting policies continued Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities the amendment to the standard claries the existing application issues relating to the offsetting rules.
It claries the meaning of currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off and simultaneous realisation and settlement.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets the amendment to the standard restricts the requirement todisclose the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU to periods in which an impairment loss has been recognised or reverses.
It also expands the disclosure requirements applicable when an asset or CGUs recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of fair value less costs ofdisposal.
Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting this amendment allows the continuation of hedge accounting when a derivative is novated to a clearing counterparty and certain conditions are met.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 1,659.2m 2014: 1,509.5m: 2013: 1,665.8m as set out in note11 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was 197.0m 2014: 217.9m: 2013: 281.8m as set out innote 12.
Contract and franchise accounting Judgements are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and liabilities arising from franchises and long term service contracts.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of franchises and contracts, which require assessments and judgements relating to the expected level of revenues and costs and, in cases where options exist, thelife of the contract or franchise.
The useful economic lives of assets are determined by reference to the length of a franchise and matched to the franchise end date.
The residual value of assets is determined by their condition at the franchise end date and by the amount of maintenance that has been carried out during the period of operation.
In particular UK Rail has a number of contractual relationships including those with the DfT and Network Rail.
Due to the regulated nature of the UK Rail industry, disputes and claims typically arise with such bodies as well as other TOCs where one or more TOCs have access to common infrastructure such as railway lines.
Judgement is required by management as to the amounts receivable and also payable taking account of the information available at the time.
Dened benefit pension arrangements Measurement of dened benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, expected rate of ination of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates.
The most significant of these are the discount rate and ination rate assumptions.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 3m and 32m respectively.
A 0.1% movement in the ination rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 3m and 24m respectively.
The net pension deficit as at the balance sheet date was 239.4m 2014: 260.7m: 2013: 247.8m as set out in note 34.
Self-insurance and legal provisions Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance or a legal liability using managements best estimate of the likely settlement of these incidents or claims, where in the case of legal claims the amount can be reliably measured.
The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice or internal legal counsel with external counsel sought as required.

The Groups adjusted performance is used to explain year on year changes when theeffect of certain items are significant, including amortisation, business disposals, aged legal claims and revisions to onerous contracts, as theDirectors consider that this basis more appropriately reects operating performance and a better understanding of the key performance indicators of the business.

Gain on disposal of property A gain on disposal of 25.3m 2014: nil was realised on the sale of a Greyhound garage in Miami.
The proceeds of this disposal of 31.6m were received during the year.
Legal claims Two separate legal claims that pre-date the Laidlaw acquisition and were acquired with the former Laidlaw entities had adverse developments during the year and we now estimate that it will cost signicantly more to settle these cases.
As a result there was a charge of 12.2m 2014: nil.
IT licences A number of Group IT licences have been written off as the projects to which they relate will now be achieved in an alternative, less costly and more appropriate way.
The charge for these licences was 8.7m 2014: nil.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 119 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Reconciliation to non-GAAP measures and performance continued UK Bus depot sales and closures There was a charge of 7.5m 2014: 13.0m credit in the year relating to operating losses and xed asset impairments.
The credit in 2014 largely represents the gain on disposal of London operations.
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision There was a charge of nil 2014: 4.6m credit in the year.
The credit in 2014 reected the fact that losses in the final seven periods of the old franchise were not as high as initially projected partly due to contractual changes agreed with the DfT.
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives There was a 0.3m 2014: 17.6m non-cash charge during the year due to ineffectiveness on financial derivatives.
The principal component of thecharge in 2014 related to certain US Dollar swaps which were no longer required as the underlying borrowings were repaid from proceeds ofthe rights issue.
5 Business segments and geographical information For management purposes, the Group is organised into five operating divisions First Student, First Transit, Greyhound, UK Bus and UK Rail.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2015 2014 2013 m m m Carrying amount First Student 1,073.5 975.7 1,081.4 First Transit 259.5 232.0 254.0 Greyhound 244.6 218.8 239.5 UK Bus 76.0 77.4 85.3 UK Rail 5.6 5.6 5.6 1,659.2 1,509.5 1,665.8 Impairment testing At the year end, the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash ows arising ineach relevant CGU.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2015 16 and Five Year Plan projections up to 2019 20 which take account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
The projections for First Student assume the incremental benets of the existing recovery plan, the programme to address contract portfolio pricing together with an economic recovery.
Cashows in 2019 20 are extrapolated using estimated long term growth rates of 2.5% 2014: 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% 2014: 3.0% for North America which do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the market.
A risk adjustment is then made using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.0% 2014: 9.0% for the United Kingdom CGUs and 10.0% 2014: 10.0% for the North American CGUs to arrive at the value in use.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are derived from a market participants weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the Groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in light of economic and industry forecasts.
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, long term growth rates and margins achievable.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount in respect of the First Transit, Greyhound, UK Bus and UKRaildivisions.
The value in use of the First Student division exceeds its carrying amount by 300.9m 2014: 127.4m.
The sensitivity analysis indicates that the First Student margin or long term growth rates would need to fall in excess of 132 or 114 basis points respectively compared to future projections for there to be an impairment to the carrying value of net assets in this business.
An increase in the discount rate in excess of 93 basis points would lead to the value in use of the division being less than its carrying amount.
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no further impairment to any of the CGUs.

Credit risk exists in relation to the Groups financial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of 716.6m 2014: 663.6m: 2013: 641.0m, cash and cash equivalents of 420.5m 2014: 553.9m: 2013: 682.1m and derivative financial instruments of 60.8m 2014: 51.9m: 2013: 86.6m.

The exposure is spread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty was 60.0m 2014: 70.0m: 2013: 51.3m at the balance sheet date.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was 2.3m 2014: 2.9m: 2013: 3.2m.
130 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 16 Trade and other receivables continued Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the DfT, Network Rail, Transport for London, Transport Scotland and citycouncils in the UK and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America.
The Group does not consider any of these counterparties to be a significant risk.
Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by large banks with a minimum of A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board.
Group treasury policy limits the maximum deposit with any one counterparty to 75m, and limits the maximum term to three months.

There are also First Student yellow school buses which are surplus to requirements and are being actively marketed on the Internet.
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of such assets are included in arriving at operating profit in the income statement.
The Group expects to sell such yellow school buses within 12 months of them going onto the for sale list.
The value at each balance sheet date represents managements best estimate of their resale value.
There are no liabilities associated with these held for sale assets.

Capital management Overall the Groups objective is to achieve a post-tax return on capital employed ROCE in the range of 10% to 12% in the medium term.
We also aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and appropriate balance sheet liquidity headroom.
The Group has net debt:EBITDA of 2.25 times as at March 2015 2014: 2.25 times and is targeting net debt:EBITDA of 2.0 times in the medium term.
ROCE is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit after tax by net assets, excluding debt items.
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong.
At 31 March 2015 there was 1,023.8m 2014: 988.5m of committed headroom and free cash.
Largely due to seasonality in the North American school bus business, committed headroom typically reduces during the financial year up to October and increases thereafter.
The Groups Treasury policy requires a minimum of 250m of committed headroom at all times.
The Groups net debt, excluding accrued bond interest at 31 March 2015, was 1,407.3m 2014: 1,303.8m as set out on page 54 of the Operating and financial review.

The US Dollar finance leases have a fair value of 255.6m 2014: 277.7m: 2013: 304.1m.
The fair value is calculated by discounting future cash ows that will arise under the lease agreements.

Loan notes of 8.7m 2014: 8.7m: 2013: 8.7m are supported by unsecured bank guarantees.
The loan notes have an average effective borrowing rate of 10.1% 2014: 10.1%: 2013: 10.1% and an average remaining term of 5 years 2014:6years: 2013: 7 years assuming that the holders do not request redemption.
The fair value of the loan notes has been determined tobe13.4m 2014: 13.6m: 2013: 15.0m.
This has been calculated by discounting future cash ows that will arise under the loan notes.

The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Group Finance Director.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The objective of the Groups liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient committed liquidity resources exist.
The Group has a diversied debt structure largely represented by medium term unsecured syndicated committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and finance leases.
Itisa policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 250m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates.
The next material contractual expiry of revolver bank facilities is in June 2019.
Largely due to the seasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increases again by the followingMarch.
The average duration of net debt excluding ring-fenced cash at 31 March 2015 was 5.2 years 2014: 6.1 years: 2013: 5.4 years.
The following tables detail the Groups expected maturity of payables receivables for its derivative financial instruments.
The amounts in these tables are different to the balance sheet as the table is prepared on an undiscounted cash ow basis.
Total amounts receivable per the tables are 114.3m 2014:78.3m: 2013: 595.7m.
For all years above the tables include the settlement of principal amounts at the end of the term of the cross currency swaps.
No derivative financial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in any of the years.
Currency risk Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash ows reported in pounds Sterling due to movements inexchange rates.
The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
Consequently the principal currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to pounds Sterling.
Group treasury policy aims to protect EPS from currency movements.
US Dollar earnings arising in the US are mitigated by USDollar denominated costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest costs and US Dollar tax costs.
Cash ow exposures are not material.
IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange rates.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar.
The analysis has been prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.
Apositive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.
2015 2014 2013 m m m Impact on profit after tax 12.0 10.9 11.8 Impact on hedging reserve 5.7 0.1 2.7 Interest rate risk The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates.
The Group treasury policy objective is to maintain xed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility is substantially reduced year on year to EPS.
The policy objective is primarily achieved through xed rate debt.
The main oating rate benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and pounds Sterling LIBOR.
This xed rate protection had an average duration of 5.3 years 2014:6.3years: 2013: 5.5 years.
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing xed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the 250.0m 2019 and the 350.0m 2021 Sterling bonds relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps.
These swaps offset the fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bonds.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis points 1% increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant.

The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash ows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis.
The differences between the xed and oating rates are settled on a net basis.

The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of xed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access for potentially lower costs over the medium term.
The Group primarily uses xed rate swap instruments to achieve significant xed price certainty.
During the year to 31 March 2015, the Group was hedged 88% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2015 to March 2017 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 31March 2016.
The swaps give rise to monthly cash ow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of oating price costs, except where they have a deferred start date.
Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on qualifying hedges to achieve xed rate fuel costs within operating results.

The earliest period in which some of the assets will expire is year ended 31 March 2027.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of nil 2014: nil: 2013: 4m of capital losses.
The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that the majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years although certain liabilities in respect of lifetime obligations of 19.0m 2014: 17.7m: 2013: 20.0m can extend for up to 30 years.
The utilisation of 163.7m 2014: 176.1m: 2013: 173.1m represents payments made largely against the current liability of the preceding year.
Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases led or thought highly likely to be led for incidents that occurred prior to the balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within 10 years.
Also included are provisions in respect of costs anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
The pensions provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain UK Bus companies.
It is anticipated that this will beutilised over five to 10 years.

The 12.2m consideration represents 11.0m cash paid in the year and 1.2m of deferred consideration.
Included within the purchase agreement is a put option for the Group to purchase the remaining 49% from the non-controlling interest party for axed price of US$19.1m.
As the put option is a contract to purchase the Groups own equity instruments it gives rise to a financial liability for thexed price amount in accordance with paragraph 23 in IAS 32.
We have recognised the financial liability in the balance sheet and the initial recognition is treated as reclassied from equity.

Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an entitlement vests.
The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it.

UK The Group operates dened contribution retirement benefit plans for all Group and UK Bus division employees who have joined a pension arrangement from January 2011 and April 2013, respectively.
They will receive a Company match to their contributions, which varies by salarylevel.
North America Employees in the US have been able to join a dened contribution arrangement for many years.
They will receive a Company match to their contributions, which varies by employment status.
The Company match is 50% of member contributions, to a Company maximum of 3% for full-time employees and $250 per annum for part-time employees.
All new employees in Canada join a dened contribution arrangement.
Union employees join the Eastern or Western plan, dependent upon their geographical location, whilst managers and supervisors join the Supervisory plan, for non-union employees.
Members of the Western and Supervisory plans can contribute 2%, 3%, 4% or 5%, and receive a 50% Company match.
Members of the Eastern plan may contribute 2%, 3%or 4%, and receive a 100% Company match.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement of 23.0m 2014: 19.6m represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Dened benefit plans The Group sponsors 16 funded dened benefit plans across its operations, covering approximately 70,000 former and current employees.
UK The majority of dened benefit provision is through Trust-based schemes.
With the exception of the Railways Pension Schemes RPS, these arrangements are now closed to new entrants.
In these arrangements the assets of the schemes are invested separately from those of the Group, and the schemes are run by independent Trustee boards.
The Trustee board of the pension schemes is required by law, or by their Articles of Association, to act in the best interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i. e. active employees, inactive employees, retirees, beneciaries and employers.
There is a requirement for the Trustee board to have some member representation with the other Trustees being company appointed.
The Trustee board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the fund, although the Company must be consulted on this, and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Schemes are valued at least triennially, when the cost of future service is calculated and the funding position established.
The Company and Trustee board are required to agree on assumptions for the valuation and to agree the contributions that result from this.
The contributions may need to incorporate deficit recovery contributions in addition to future service contributions, if a deficit position is determined through the valuation.
If a surplus is shown at the valuation, this may be used to reduce future service contributions.
In agreeing contribution rates, reference must be made to the affordability of contributions by the employer.
In most arrangements, any surplus after benets have been paid secured, can be repaid to the employer.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 149 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 34 Retirement benefit schemes continued The First UK Bus Pension Scheme This predominantly provides pension benets to employees in the UK Bus division.
Historically the scheme provided final salary benets and career average benets.
However, with effect from April 2012, the scheme only provides career average benets with a retirement age linked to State Pension age and a cap on the pensionable pay on which dened benets can be built.
Following negotiations with recognised Trades Unions, changes were made to the benefit provisions from April 2015, which included: Q Reducing the cap on defined benefit pensionable pay to 21,580 2014-2015: 30,660 and removing indexation on the cap.
Q Revising the split of the cost of future service so that the employer meets 50% of the cost and the employees 50%.
Caps and collars on the level of employee contributions that previously existed have been removed to achieve this.
Q Introducing an annual test, commencing April 2017, such that if agreed funding levels are not achieved, the scheme will close to defined benefit accrual 12 months later.
In addition there is a smaller Group scheme which provided dened benefit pensions to Group employees and executives.
This closed to new entrants in 2011.
The Railways Pension Scheme The Group currently sponsors four sections of the RPS, relating to its franchising obligations for its TOCs, and for Hull Trains, its Open Accessoperator.
Under this scheme members build a 1 60th pension and 1 40th lump sum based upon their pensionable pay.
Some members of the RPS are subject to Protected Persons legislation, which requires individual consent to changes to benets, and certain rights upon transfer between sections of the scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost arrangement.
All costs, and any deficit or surplus is shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the members.
Furthermore, under the franchising obligations, the responsibility of the employer is to pay the contributions requested of the Trustee whilst itoperates the franchise.
There is no residual liability or asset for any deficit, or surplus, which remains at the end of the franchise period.
In calculating the Groups pension obligations in respect of the RPS the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit which is projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash ows of the Groups obligations.
Allowance is also made in the preparation of the financial statements for the cost sharing nature of the benefit and in particular, only 60% of the total profit and loss charge and balance sheet position are attributed to the Group and recognised in the accounts.
Hull Trains is not subject to franchising obligations, and as such it is accounted for under IAS 19 as a dened benefit scheme, although subject to the same cost sharing obligations as for the franchised sections.
During the year, the Groups participation in the Capital Connect section of the RPS ceased.
The assets and liabilities of 277.4m and 390.8m respectively were transferred to the new franchise operator on 13 September 2014.
The assets and liabilities in respect of the Scotrail franchise are included within the pension disclosures at the Balance Sheet date and amount to 525.1m and 724.2m respectively.
These passed across tothe new franchise operator on 1 April 2015.
Local Government Pension Schemes The Group participates in five Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS, three in England and two in Scotland.
These differ from Trust-based schemes in that their benets are prescribed by legislation, and they are administered by local authorities, and pension committees consisting of localcouncillors.
Typically the Group has less control over the investment strategy adopted by the LGPS compared to the UK Trust-based schemes.
Historically benefit accrual in these schemes has been based on final salary.
The benefit structure changed to a 1 47th career average benefit in England in April 2014 and in Scotland in April 2015.
Normal pension age will be aligned with State Pension Age from that time.
Some members have a right to receive some of their benets on an unreduced basis, conditional on age and service.
As with the Trust-based schemes, valuations take place at least triennially.
Generally contribution rates are agreed for the three year period untilthe next valuation.
Whilst these are balance of cost schemes, at termination there is no right for the Company to receive any surplus in the schemes, although there is an obligation on the Company to fully fund the benets.
To reect this, the Group only recognise existing surpluses relating to the LGPS when determining the balance sheet position, to the extent that these surpluses could be recouped by the reduction of future company contributions.
150 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 34 Retirement benefit schemes continued North America US The Group operates two dened benefit arrangements in the US.
These are legacy arrangements with benefit accrual having ceased some yearsago.
The schemes are valued annually, when the funding position and minimum and maximum contributions are established.
Changes in funding position create new surplus or deficit each year, which is normally spread over seven years, as required by legislation.
However, funding relief passed by Congress in 2010, 2012 and again in 2014, has allowed greater exibility following the global financial crisis.
Themost recent funding relief, passed in 2012 and extended in 2014, has the effect of increasing the funding discount rate, which acts to lower liabilities, deficits and contributions.
This effect will reduce over time.
Greyhound Canada There are three plans, relating to Eastern, Western and Supervisory employees.
All these plans are now closed to new members, although benetaccrual continues for existing members.
Very small executive arrangements also exist.
The plans are valued annually, where the cost of future service and the funding position are identied.
Future service costs are shared in proportion between the members and the Company, although there are caps on the member rates.
deficit contributions are met entirely by the Company.
Cash contributions are required to fund the plans on a going concern basis, whilst the usually higher solvency deficit can be made good through a Letter of Credit.
There is a cap on the value of the Letter of Credit, which cannot exceed 15% of the value of the assets held in theplan.
At their last triennial valuations, the dened benefit schemes had funding levels between 74.1% and 105.1% 2014: 70.5% and 101.9%: 2013:61.0% and 101.9%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2015 for all dened benefit schemes totalled 4,146m 2014: 3,902m: 2013: 3,777m.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.

The net present value reects the current value of deficit recovery payments that would be required to meet the actuarial deficit in full, discounted at 9.0% per annum.
Management consider that, were a pension asset to arise in respect of this scheme, this would be fully recoverable through actions within the Groups control, in line with the rules of the scheme.
The estimated amounts of employer contributions expected to be paid to the dened benefit schemes during the financial year to 31 March 2016 is 88.3m.
Risks associated with dened benefit plans: Generally the number of employees in dened benefit plans is reducing rapidly, as these plans are largely closed to new entrants, and in many cases to future accrual.
Consequently, the number of dened contribution members is increasing.
Furthermore, changes have been implemented to the First UK Bus Pension Scheme with effect from April 2015 which allow for the closure of the scheme if the funding level is not in line with the target level.
This change will serve to limit the risks associated with dened benefit pension provision by the Group.
Despite remaining open to new entrants and future accrual, the risks posed by the RPS are limited, as under the franchise arrangements, the UK Rail TOCs are not responsible for any residual deficit at the end of a franchise.
As such, there is only short term cash ow risk within this business.
The key risks relating to the dened benefit pension arrangements and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate them are as follows: Risk Description Mitigation Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with Asset liability modelling has been undertaken recently in all reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this significant plans to ensure that any risks taken are expected yield, this will create a deficit.
