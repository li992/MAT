Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Directors Responsibilities Statement set out on page 142, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors: and the overall presentation of the Group financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2014-15 to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect EDVHG RQ RU PDWHULDOO LQFRQVLVWHQW ZLWK WKH NQRZOHGJH DFTXLUHG E XV LQ WKH FRXUVH RI SHUIRUPLQJ WKH DXGLW, I ZH EHFRPH Dware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

We also determine a level of performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material for the financial statements as a whole.
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be 27.1 million, which is approximately five per cent of adjusted profit before tax 2013-14: five per cent of adjusted profit before tax.
This provided a basis for GHWHUPLQLQJ WKH QDWXUH WLPLQJ DQG H[WHQW RI ULVN DVVHVVPHQW SURFHGXUHV LGHQWLI LQJ DQG DVVHVVLQJ WKH ULVN RI PDWHULDO PLVVWatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.

Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that, together with qualitative considerations, total detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our planning materiality of 27.1 million for the financial statements as a whole.
We agreed with the Audit and 5LVN &RPPLWWHH WKDW ZH ZRXOG UHSRrt to the Committee all adjusted and unadjusted audit differences in excess of 1.4 million.
We also agreed to report differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
