Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 107 5 Segmental analysis The group has two reportable segments: Severn Trent Water and Severn Trent Services.
The key factor determining the identication of reportable segments is the regulatory environment in which the businesses operate.
Severn Trent Water is subject to economic regulation by Ofwat and operates under a licence to provide water and sewerage services within a dened geographical region in England and Wales.
Severn Trent Services is not subject to economic regulation and operates in markets in the USA, Europe and Asia.
Interests in joint ventures and associates are not material and are not included in the segmental reports reviewed by STEC.
The Severn Trent Executive Committee STEC is considered to be the groups chief operating decision maker.
The reports provided to STEC include segmental information prepared on the basis described above.
Details of Severn Trent Waters operations are described on pages 18 to 29 of the Strategic Review and those of Severn Trent Services on pages 32 to 35.
Transactions between reportable segments are included within segmental results, assets and liabilities in accordance with group accounting policies.
These are eliminated on consolidation.
The group has a large and diverse customer base and there is no significant reliance on any single customer.
The measure of profit or loss that is reported to STEC for the segments is underlying PBIT profit before interest, tax and exceptional items.
A segmental analysis of sales and underlying PBIT is presented below.
The results from the Water Purication business have been excluded from the Severn Trent Services segment, in both the current and prior year, as it has been classied as a discontinued operation.

This includes a credit of 8.6 million 2014: charge of 9.3 million arising from adjustments to prior year tax computations.
In the prior year an exceptional current tax credit of 59.2 million was recognised, reecting the anticipated refund of overpayment of tax in prior periods.
This was following an agreement with HMRC that certain capital expenditure within our water and waste water treatment works is eligible for capital allowances as plant and machinery.
This also resulted in an exceptional deferred tax credit of 56.2 million.
The Finance Act 2013 was enacted in the prior year which implemented a reduction in the corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and then to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
This resulted in an additional exceptional deferred tax credit of 114.8 million in the income statement and a deferred tax charge of 12.3 million in reserves.

Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 115 15 Earnings per share a Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing and discontinued operations attributable to the owners of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2015 2014 m m profit for the period attributable to owners of the company 119.1 433.8 Adjusted for profit loss from discontinued operations see note 38 3.7 39.1 profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to owners of the company 115.4 472.9 Number of shares 2015 2014 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 238.8 238.2 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share options and LTIPs 1.1 1.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 239.9 239.3 b Adjusted earnings per share 2015 2014 pence pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 107.2 92.5 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 106.7 92.1 Adjusted earnings per share gures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, exceptional tax, losses gains on financial instruments, current tax related to losses gains on financial instruments, exceptional items and current tax related to exceptional items.
The directors consider that the adjusted gures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted gures set out above.
Adjustments to earnings The adjustments to earnings that are made in calculating adjusted earnings per share are as follows: 2015 2014 Restated m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 115.4 472.9 Adjustments for exceptional items before tax 18.7 15.2 current tax related to exceptional items 4.7 0.9 loss gain on financial instruments 133.5 58.0 current tax related to loss gain on financial instruments 1.8 0.1 deferred tax excluding exceptional charge 5.1 21.5 exceptional tax 230.2 Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 256.0 220.4 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 116 Notes to the group financial statements continued 16 Goodwill 2015 2014 m m Cost At 1 April 42.9 45.2 Transferred to assets held for sale see note 38 26.5 Exchange adjustments 1.3 2.3 At 31 March 17.7 42.9 Impairment At 1 April 28.1 3.5 Impairment charge in the year 24.7 Transferred to assets held for sale see note 38 24.7 Exchange adjustments 0.1 At 31 March 3.4 28.1 Net book value At 31 March 14.3 14.8 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identied according to country of operation and business segment.
All of the groups goodwill is in the Severn Trent Services segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation by CGU is presented below.
Goodwill in the groups Water Purication business is included in assets held for sale at 31 March 2015, see note 38.
2015 2014 m m Water Purication US 1.4 Operating Services US 12.5 11.2 Services Italy 1.8 2.2 14.3 14.8 The group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill, including that within the Water Purication US CGU, for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2l.
The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions underlying these budgets are revenue growth and margin.
Management of each CGU determines assumptions based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash ows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates and are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Post tax discount rate Pre-tax discount rate 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 % % % % % % Operating Services US 3.0 3.5 6.0 6.8 7.6 9.1 Services Italy 1.8 2.5 4.6 6.5 5.5 8.8 Specic discount rates for the CGUs are not available and hence a post tax discount rate reecting risks relating to the CGU has been estimated and used to calculate the value in use of the CGU from its post tax cash ow projections.
The equivalent pre-tax discount rate is disclosed above.
Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash ows may cause a CGUs carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
However, in the opinion of the directors, the changes in growth rate or discount rate that would be required to reduce the recoverable amount of the CGUs below their carrying value are not reasonably possible.
Therefore no sensitivity analysis has been presented.

By far the most significant business unit of the group is Severn Trent Water, which represents 88% of group turnover and 76% of net trade receivables.
Severn Trent Water has a statutory obligation to provide water and sewerage services to customers within its region.
Therefore there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to its trade receivables and the credit quality of its customer base reects the wealth and prosperity of all of the commercial businesses and domestic households within its region.
None of the other business units are individually significant to the group.

The dened benefit pension schemes cover increases in accrued benets arising from ination and future pension increases.
Their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneciaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualied actuary.
Under the dened benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benets calculated as a proportion varying between 1 30 and 1 80 for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of employment.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income since the adoption of IFRS is a net loss of 459.1 million 2014: 315.7 million.
iv Actuarial risk factors The schemes typically expose the company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, ination risk and longevity risk.
Investment risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on actuarial calculations which make assumptions about the returns expected from the schemes investments.
If the investments underperform these assumptions in the long term then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 126 Notes to the group financial statements continued 28 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Dened benefit pension schemes continued iv Actuarial risk factors continued Inflation risk The benets payable to members of the schemes are linked to ination measured by the RPI.
The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the future level of ination.
If ination is higher than the levels assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
Longevity risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the life expectancy of scheme members after retirement.
If scheme members live longer than assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
v Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2015 2014 % % Price ination 3.0 3.3 Discount rate 3.3 4.4 Salary increases n a 3.0 Pension increases in payment 3.0 3.3 Pension increases in deferment 3.0 3.3 The assumption for price ination is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term xed rate gilts and on index-linked gilts.
The discount rate is set by reference to AA rated sterling 18 year corporate bonds.
No salary assumption is required in the current year because the scheme closed to future accrual on 31 March 2015.
The mortality assumptions are based on those used in the triennial valuation of the STPS as at 31 March 2013.
The mortality assumptions adopted at the year end and the life expectancies at age 65 implied by the assumptions are as follows: 2015 2014 Men Women Men Women SAPS SAPS Mortality table used S1NMA L S1NFA L S1NMA L S1NFA L Mortality table compared with standard table 116% 92% 116% 92% Future improvement per annum 1% 1% 1% 1% Remaining life expectancy for members currently aged 65 years 21.4 24.5 21.3 24.4 Remaining life expectancy at age 65 for members currently aged 45 years 22.7 26.1 22.6 26.0 The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price ination and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 50 million Price ination Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 45 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 75 million In reality, interrelationships exist between the assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and price ination.
The above analysis does not take into account the effect of these interrelationships.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the dened benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the dened benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 129 33 Capital management The groups principal objectives in managing capital are: to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need for continued availability: to manage exposure to movements in interest rates to provide an appropriate degree of certainty as to its cost of funds: to minimise counterparty credit exposure risk: to provide the group with an appropriate degree of certainty as to its foreign exchange exposure: to maintain an investment grade credit rating: and to maintain a exible and sustainable balance sheet structure.
The group seeks to achieve a balance of long term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible economic cost.
The group monitors future funding requirements and credit market conditions to ensure continued availability of funds.
Whilst the group does not have a specic gearing target and seeks to maintain gearing at a level consistent with its capital management objectives described above, the board has decided to move towards a net debt RCV gearing ratio of around 62.5%, which is in line with Ofwats notional assumption for AMP6.
As part of this move, on 13 February 2015 the group announced that it had entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement to enable market purchases of ordinary shares up to an amount of 110 million.
The group took a number of nancing steps in readiness for AMP6, aimed at reducing short term renancing risk and increasing exposure to currently low oating interest rates.
These steps included: Entering into a new 530 million, oating rate, nine year facility with the European Investment Bank.
At 31 March 2015, 200 million of the facility had been drawn, with the balance drawn down in April 2015.
On 31 March 2015 the group purchased 182.6 million of its 700 million Eurobond which is due for repayment in March 2016.
On the same date the equivalent amount of the corresponding swap, paying xed rate 6.325%, was cancelled.
In March 2015 the group cancelled oating to xed interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of 275 million, for a cash payment of 139.2 million.
The average xed rate interest on the swaps was 5.2%.
The cash payment was charged against the fair value liability on the balance sheet, and 11 million that had been recognised in reserves was recycled through the income statement.
On 19 March 2015 the group amended and extended the revolving credit facility which was due to mature in October 2018.
The new 900 million facility has a period of five years, with two one year extension options exercisable with lender consent.
At 31 March 2015 485 million of the facility was drawn.
The groups dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives.
This policy is reviewed and updated in line with Severn Trent Waters five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia, the planned investment programme, the appropriate gearing level achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital and retaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering an attractive and sustainable return to shareholders.
The board has decided to set the 2015 16 dividend at 80.66p, a reduction of 5% compared to the total dividend for 2014 15 of 84.90p.
Our policy will then be to grow the dividend annually at no less than RPI until March 2020.
This replaces the previous dividend policy of RPI 3% which ran until March 2015.

b Comparison of fair value of financial instruments with their carrying amounts The directors consider that the carrying amounts of cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts, trade receivables and trade payables approximate their fair values.
Index-linked bonds are rarely traded and therefore quoted prices are not considered to be a reliable indicator of fair value.
Therefore, these bonds are valued using discounted cash ow models with discount rates derived from observed market prices for a sample of bonds.
Fair values of the other debt instruments are also calculated using discounted cash ow models.
Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 131 35 Risks arising from financial instruments The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price risk : credit risk: liquidity risk: and ination risk.
The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
The board has established a Treasury Committee to monitor treasury activities and to facilitate timely responses to changes in market conditions when necessary.
Group Treasury identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board defines written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading but may be used to mitigate the groups exposure to financial risk.
The types of derivative instruments held and the related risks are described below.
Interest rate swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in market interest rates.
Further details are set out in sections a i and note 36 b below.
Cross currency swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate movements on amounts borrowed in foreign currencies.
Further details are set out in section a ii below.
Energy swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in electricity prices.
Further details are provided in note 36 b below.
Severn Trent Water, the groups most significant business unit, operates in a regulatory environment where its prices are linked to ination measured by RPI.
In order to mitigate the risks to cash ow and earnings arising from uctuations in RPI, the group holds debt instruments where the principal repayable and interest cost is linked to RPI.
a Market risk The group is exposed to uctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, exchange rates.
The nature of these risks and the steps that the group has taken to manage them are described below.
i Interest rate risk The groups income and its operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to the risk of adverse cash ow impacts from increases in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to the risk of interest costs above the market rate when interest rates decrease.
The groups policy is to maintain 45% to 90% of its interest bearing liabilities in xed rate instruments.
In measuring this metric, management makes adjustments to the carrying value of debt to better reect the amount that interest is calculated on.
Details of the adjustments made are set out below: 2015 2014 m m Net debt see note 39 4,752.6 4,447.5 Cash and cash equivalents 176.7 123.2 Cross currency swaps included in net debt at fair value 2.6 51.4 Fair value hedge accounting adjustments 19.1 26.8 Exchange on currency debt 22.6 18.6 Interest bearing financial liabilities 4,930.2 4,576.7 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 132 Notes to the group financial statements continued 35 Risks arising from financial instruments continued a Market risk continued i Interest rate risk continued The group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by borrowing at xed or index-linked rates or by using interest rate swaps.
Under these swaps the group receives variable rate interest and pays xed rate interest calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
In practice the swaps are settled by transferring the net amount.
These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from variable rates to xed rates.
The group has entered into a series of these interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments beyond 2030.
The following tables show analyses of the groups interest bearing financial liabilities by type of interest.
Debt raised in foreign currencies has been included at the sterling value of the payable leg of the corresponding cross currency swap since this is the amount that is exposed to changes in interest rates.
Valuation adjustments that do not impact the amount on which interest is calculated, such as fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are excluded from this analysis.
The net principal amount of interest rate swaps is shown as an adjustment to oating rate and xed rate debt to demonstrate the impact of the swaps on the amount of liabilities bearing xed interest.

Economically these swaps act to x the interest cost of debt within the group which is denominated as oating rate, but they do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a charge of 108.0 million 2014: credit of 66.7 million in the income statement.

Although the group operates internationally and its net investments in foreign operations are subject to exchange risk, substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, and therefore the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Certain of the groups subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
Exchange risks relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
In order to meet its objective of accessing a broad range of sources of finance, the group has raised debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
In order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations, cross currency swaps were entered into at the time that the debt was drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.

It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 21.
Cash deposits and derivative contracts are only placed with high credit quality financial institutions, which have been approved by the board.
Group Treasury monitors the credit quality of the approved financial institutions and the list of financial institutions that may be used is approved annually by the board.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Credit risk analysis At 31 March the aggregate credit limits of authorised counterparties and the amounts held on short term deposits were as follows: Credit limit Amount deposited 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m AAA 20.0 20.0 1.2 1.2 Double A range 100.0 100.0 22.1 24.2 Single A range 600.0 600.0 128.5 51.4 720.0 720.0 151.8 76.8 The fair values of derivative assets analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Derivative assets 2015 2014 Rating m m Double A range 11.5 16.7 Single A range 15.5 68.6 27.0 85.3 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 135 35 Risks arising from financial instruments continued c Liquidity risk i Committed facilities Prudent liquidity management requires sufficient cash balances to be maintained: adequate committed facilities to be available: and the ability to close out market positions.
Group Treasury manages liquidity and exibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and the maturity prole of financial assets and liabilities, and by keeping committed credit lines available.
During the year the group agreed two new facilities: a 530 million committed facility, of which 200 million was drawn at the 31 March 2015, which will mature in September 2023, and a 900 million revolving credit facility, of which 485 million was drawn at the 31 March 2015, which will mature in March 2020.
At the balance sheet date the group had committed undrawn borrowing facilities expiring as follows: 2015 2014 m m 2-5 years 415.0 500.0 After more than five years 330.0 745.0 500.0 ii Cash ows from non-derivative financial instruments The following tables show the estimated cash ows that will arise from the groups non-derivative net financial liabilities.
The information presented is based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay and represents the undiscounted cash ows including principal and interest.
Interest and ination assumptions are based on prevailing market conditions at the year end date.
The principal is revalued at xed intervals and is linked to movements in the Retail Price Index.
Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal.
The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at maturity.
The payments included in the table above are estimates based on the forward ination rates published by the Bank of England at the balance sheet date.
iii Cash ows from derivative financial instruments The following tables show the estimated cash ows that will arise from the groups derivative financial instruments.
The tables are based on the undiscounted net cash inows outows on the derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inows outows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not xed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates derived from the forward curves existing at the balance sheet date.
Actual amounts may be signicantly different from those indicated below.

Its operating profits and cash ows are therefore exposed to changes in RPI.
In order to mitigate and partially offset this risk, Severn Trent Water has raised debt which pays interest at a xed coupon based on a principal amount that is adjusted for the change in RPI during the life of the debt instrument index-linked debt.
The amount of index-linked debt at the balance sheet date is shown in section a i interest rate risk, and the estimated future cash ows relating to this debt are shown in section c ii cash ows from non-derivative financial instruments.
Ination rate sensitivity analysis The finance cost of the groups index-linked debt instruments varies with changes in RPI rather than interest rates.
The sensitivity at 31 March of the groups profit and equity to changes in RPI is set out in the following table.
This analysis relates to financial instruments only and excludes any RPI impact on Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulated Capital Value, or accounting for dened benefit pension schemes.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
a Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m US dollar 27.0 27.0 7.3 4.7 Euro 11.4 11.4 8.0 8.4 Yen 23.8 71.4 7.3 15.9 Czech krona 14.7 4.6 62.2 124.5 22.6 33.6 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 138 Notes to the group financial statements continued 36 Hedge accounting continued b Cash ow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between xed and oating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash ow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
Where the hedge is expected to be highly effective these interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash ow hedges.
At the beginning of AMP5 the group entered into a number of interest rate contracts with future start dates during the regulatory period to hedge the interest rate risk on the anticipated borrowings requirements of Severn Trent Water.
These swaps were accounted for as cash ow hedges.
During the year interest rate swaps with notional principal value 225 million reached their start dates.
Hedge accounting has been discontinued for these contracts as it has not been possible to match the swaps against specic debt instruments.
These instruments are now included in note 35 a.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash ow hedges are summarised below: Average contract xed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Period to maturity % % m m m m 10-20 years 5.18% 5.14% 42.3 264.7 10.5 47.2 The group has entered into a series of energy swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between xed and market prices of electricity at six-monthly intervals up to March 2018.

38 Discontinued operations On 23 January 2015 the board approved a process to dispose of the groups Water Purication business which formed part of the Severn Trent Services segment.
These operations were classied as discontinued and as a disposal group held for sale as at 31 March 2015.
The results of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the income statement and the assets and liabilities of the disposal group are presented separately in the balance sheet.
On 12 May 2015 the group entered into a binding agreement to sell the business to Industrie fide Nora.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the carrying value of the groups share of the disposal groups net assets and hence no impairment loss has been recognised on the classication of these operations as held for sale.

41 Service concession arrangements The groups contract to provide water and waste water services to the Ministry of Defence MoD is a service concession arrangement under the denition set out in IFRIC 12.
The group acts as the service provider under the MoD Project Aquatrine Package C a 25 year contract spanning 1,295 sites across England covering the Eastern sea border and from Lancashire in the North West to West Sussex on the South Coast.
Under the contract the group maintains and upgrades the MoD infrastructure assets and provides operating services for water and waste water.
Both the operating services and maintenance and upgrade services are charged under a volumetric tariff, along with standard charges, which are adjusted with ination as agreed in the contract.
Since the group has an unconditional right to receive cash in exchange for the maintenance and upgrade services, the amounts receivable are recognised as a financial asset within prepayments and accrued income.
At 31 March 2015 the amounts receivable were 24.4 million 2014: 24.8 million.
