The lease for the previous head office, St. Magnus House, London expired in December 2015.
The additional rent and associated costs in the year were 1.9m for Commodity Quay up to the relocation date, and 0.4m for St. Magnus House after relocation.
An onerous lease provision of 0.3m for a property in Singapore was also treated as an exceptional item.
Costs associated with the reorganisation of the enlarged group post-acquisition totalling 1.2m were treated as exceptional, as they are non-recurring.
The release of the unutilised portion of the dilapidation provision for St. Magnus House of 1.3m has been treated as exceptional other income.
2014 An onerous lease provision of 0.7m for St. Magnus House and the additional rent charge for Commodity Quay of 0.9m were treated as exceptional items.
6 Acquisition costs Included in acquisition costs are cash and share-based payment charges of 2.1m 2014: 2.8m relating to previous acquisitions.
These are contingent on employees remaining in service and are therefore spread over the service period.
Also included is 0.7m 2014: nil relating to the acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest in Clarksons Platou Tankers AS.
The charge consists of cash and share-based payment charges which are linked to future service of the employees and are therefore spread over a four year period.

Acquisitions 2015 On 2 February 2015, Clarkson PLC acquired 100% of the share capital of RS Platou ASA Platou, which subsequently changed its name to Clarksons Platou AS.
Platou is a leading international broker and investment bank providing high value brokerage, financial and advisory services focused on the offshore and shipping markets, operating from offices in 11 countries located in key global financial and shipping centres.
The Platou groups business comprises four core divisions: offshore and shipbroking included within the broking segment and investment banking and project finance included within the financial segment, which are complemented by a variety of research capabilities.
The acquisition complements the groups strategy to expand its geographical reach and broaden its offshore and project finance services to existing and new customers.
The goodwill of 232.6m represents the acquired workforce, as well as the potential new customer relationships and revenue expected to be brought in by experienced brokers and senior management team members.
It also represents the potential to achieve improved commercial competitiveness and operational efficiency in the long-term.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of the consideration was 249.9m, of which 23.5m was paid in cash, 179.9m being the fair value of ordinary shares issued based on the Clarkson PLC share price on the acquisition date and 46.5m comprised loan notes.
Under IFRS, the share price as at the acquisition date is applied to record the relevant proportion of the investment in Platou.
The provisions of merger relief under the Companies Act 2006 are applicable in relation to the shares issued as consideration such that no share premium is recorded, instead an equivalent merger reserve is recorded, as required under IFRS and permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
The total consideration of 249.9m varies from the 281.2m stated in the circular dated 27 November 2014.
The proposed fixed number of shares to be issued was initially determined based on a share price of 22.15.
On acquisition, the shares were issued at the closing market price of 18.90.

Intangible assets comprise customer relationships, forward order book and trade name identified on acquisition.
The valuation of these was performed by third party valuers.
The identified net assets and goodwill have been allocated to the appropriate foreign currencies of the Platou operation.
Net cash acquired was 43.2m, being the cash and cash equivalents of 54.0m and overdraft of 10.8m, included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The revenue included in the consolidated income statement since 2 February 2015 contributed by Platou was 65.8m.
Platou contributed profit of 12.8m over the same period.
Had Platou been consolidated from 1 January 2015, the consolidated income statement would show revenue of 308.2m and profit before taxation, exceptional items and acquisition costs of 51.5m.

Ewings Shipping Limited Ewings, via its port and agency business, Clarkson Port Services Limited CPS.
The acquisition extends the geographic coverage of CPS for vessel agency, broking and supply logistics into Northern Ireland and enables CPS to broaden its services to existing and new customers.
The goodwill of 0.4m is attributable to the acquired team and the synergies that will arise as part of the acquisition.
Consideration is payable in cash totalling 1.4m.
On the acquisition date 1.1m was paid, the remaining 0.3m was paid by January 2015.
In addition, a further 0.6m will be payable in cash to key employees contingent on them remaining in employment for three years.
An additional sum up to 0.5m will also be payable in three years subject to the same service conditions and Ewings achieving certain earnings targets over the three years.
For both of the above, the cost will be charged to the consolidated income statement over the service period.
Acquisition costs of 0.1m have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014.

90 Clarkson PLC Annual Report 2015 90 Clarkson PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 13 Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to operating segment.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to the attributable CGUs for impairment testing as follows: Dry cargo chartering Container chartering Specialised chartering Gas chartering Tankers chartering Sale and purchase broking Offshore broking Securities Port and agency services Research services The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Dry cargo chartering 12.0 12.0 Container chartering 1.8 1.8 Specialised chartering 12.2 12.2 Gas chartering 2.7 2.7 Tankers chartering 9.6 Sale and purchase broking 42.0 3.6 Offshore broking 71.4 1.8 Securities 93.8 Port and agency services 2.9 3.0 Research services 3.3 3.3 251.7 40.4 During the year, 1.8m of goodwill was reallocated from sale and purchase broking to offshore broking.
The movement in the aggregate carrying value is analysed in more detail in note 12.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs which are tested for impairment at least annually.
The goodwill arising in each CGU is similar in nature and thus the testing for impairment uses the same approach.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are assessed using a value-in-use model.
Value-in-use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated.
The groups of CGUs for which the carrying amount of goodwill is deemed significant are sale and purchase broking, offshore broking and securities.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows: the pre-tax discount rate used is based on the groups weighted average cost of capital and adjusted for risks within each CGU.
As all broking and chartering CGUs have operations that are global in nature and similar risk profiles, the same pre-tax discount rate was applied to each unit.
The broking and chartering pre-tax discount rate is 12% 2014: 12% : port and agency and research services also use a pre-tax discount rate of 12% 2014: 12% : the securities pre-tax discount rate is 11%: the cash flow predictions are based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by the board extrapolated over a three year period.
These are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development: key drivers in the plans are revenue growth, margin and operating profit percentage and include conservative annual growth rates of 1.7% 2014: between 0% and 5% with effect from 2017: and cash flows beyond this three year period are calculated in perpetuity using the above mentioned rate of 1.7%.
A change in this rate to 0% would not result in impairment.
The results of the directors review of goodwill including sensitivity analyses for reasonable changes in assumptions still indicate remaining headroom.
Accordingly, no reasonably possible change is foreseen which gives rise to an impairment of goodwill.
In light of global macro-economic and geo-political uncertainty, the board keeps the carrying value of goodwill under constant review.
In the event that any of the markets in which we operate has a sustained downturn, an impairment of the relevant CGUs goodwill may be required.

com 95 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Employee benefits The groups three defined benefit pension schemes are in the UK and all financial information provided in this note relates to the sum of the three separate schemes.
The group operates three defined benefit pension schemes, being the Clarkson PLC scheme, the Plowrights scheme and the Stewarts scheme, which are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trusts administered by Trustees who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The schemes assets are invested in a range of pooled pension investment funds managed by professional fund managers.
Defined benefit pension arrangements give rise to open ended commitments and liabilities for the sponsoring company.
As a consequence, the company closed its original defined benefit section of the Clarkson PLC scheme to new entrants on 31 March 2004.
This section was closed to further accrual for all existing members as from 31 March 2006.
The Plowrights scheme was closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
The Stewarts scheme was closed to further accrual on 1 January 2004.
Every three years, a pension scheme must obtain from an actuary a report containing a valuation and a recommendation on rates of contribution.
Triennial valuations for all the schemes have been prepared.
The valuation of the Clarkson PLC scheme showed a pension deficit on the original scheme of 6.1m as at 31 March 2013.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to continue the five year funding plan, which ended on 31 March 2015, at the rate of 1.0m per annum: they have further agreed to continue to fund at this level to 31 December 2016.
The valuation of the Plowrights scheme showed a pension deficit of 2.9m as at 31 March 2013.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to continue the funding plan, which ends on 28 February 2017 at the rate of 0.9m per annum.
The valuation of the Stewarts scheme showed a pension deficit of 2.4m as at 1 September 2012.
Clarksons Platou Offshore Limited and the Trustees to pay contributions to remove the deficit over a period of eight years and nine months from 1 September 2012 at the rate of 0.3m per annum.
The group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
All schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
Other pension arrangements Overseas defined contribution arrangements have been determined in accordance with local practice and regulations.
The group also operates various other defined contribution pension arrangements.
Where required, the group also makes contributions into these schemes.
The group incurs no material expenses in the provision of post-retirement benefits other than pensions.

Sensitivities The table below provides information on the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions.
The table shows the impact of changes to each assumption in isolation although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or compound the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation.
These sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as used for the main calculations.
The weighted average duration of the defined obligation is 16 years.

The leases have a life of between one and 15 years with renewal terms included in the contracts.
Renewals are at the option of the specific entity that holds the lease.
There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.

The group has given no guarantees 2014: none.
From time to time the group is engaged in litigation in the ordinary course of business.
The group carries professional indemnity insurance.
There is currently no litigation expected to have a material adverse financial impact on the groups consolidated results or net assets.
The group also maintained throughout the financial year directors and officers liability insurance in respect of its directors.
26 Financial risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial liabilities comprise trade payables, accruals and loan notes.
The group has various financial assets such as trade receivables, current asset investments and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The group has not entered into derivative transactions other than the forward currency contracts explained later in this section.
It is, and has been throughout 2015 and 2014, the groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk.
The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.
Credit risk The group seeks to trade only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and any potential bad debts identified at an early stage.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amounts as disclosed in note 14: based on experience and ongoing market information about the credit-worthiness of counterparties, we reasonably expect to collect all amounts unimpaired.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the group, which include cash and cash equivalents, current investments and available-for-sale financial investments, the groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
com 101 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk The group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations.

Such exposure arises from revenues and expenses by any operation where these are in currencies other than its functional currency, which can significantly impact our results, cash flows and financial position.
Revenue for our broking and financial segments is predominantly in US$ and in sterling for our support and research segments.
Our aim is to manage this risk by reducing the impact of any fluctuations.
We use foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to variations in the US$ exchange rate and to meet local currency expenditure in the ordinary course of business.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US$ exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before taxation and equity due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities.

Where these are designated and documented as hedging instruments in the context of IAS 39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and losses are recognised directly in equity see note 24 and transferred to the income statement upon receipt of cash and conversion to sterling of the underlying item being hedged.

Capital management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
These financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis and the group continues to pay dividends.
A number of the groups trading entities are subject to regulation by the Norwegian FSA, the FCA in the UK and NFA and FINRA in the US.
Regulatory capital at entity level depends on the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated.
In each case, the approach is to hold an appropriate surplus over the local minimum requirement.
Each regulated entity complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
27 Financial instruments Fair values IFRS 13 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
