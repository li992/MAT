114 SHAFTESBURY ANNUAL REPORT 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2015 1.
General information General information The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2015 presented in pounds sterling were approved by the Board for issue on 24 November 2015.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 34.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is given on page 71.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and the measurement of derivative financial instruments at fair value through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Company has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company made a profit of 103.8 million 2014: 18.2 million in the year.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors affecting performance, financial position and future development are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 34.
The financial position of the Group including cash flow, liquidity, borrowings, undrawn facilities and debt maturity analysis is set out on pages 52 to 56.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Critical judgements, assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in note 2.
Not all of these significant accounting policies require the directors to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
However the directors consider the valuation of investment properties to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved and its impact on the financial statements.
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Group uses the valuations performed by its external valuers, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, as the basis for the fair value of its investment properties.
Knight Frank LLP value the investment properties owned by the Longmartin Joint Venture.
The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental income.
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the commercial property market.
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited and Knight Frank LLP make a number of assumptions in forming their opinion on the valuation of our investment properties, which are detailed in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143.
These assumptions are in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards.
However, if any assumptions made by the external valuers prove to be incorrect, this may mean that the value of the Groups properties differs from their valuation reported in the financial statements, which could have a material effect on the Groups financial position.

Accounting policies New accounting standards and interpretations a The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year ending 30 September 2015: STANDARD OR INTERPRETATION EFFECTIVE FROM IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2014 IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10,11 and 12 on transition guidance 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities 1 January 2014 IAS 28 revised 2011 Associates and joint ventures 1 January 2014 Amendments to IAS 32 Financial instruments asset and liability offsetting 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 36 Impairment of assets on recoverable amount disclosures 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, on novation of derivatives and hedge accounting 1 January 2014 The only new standard or amendment to have a material impact on the Group is IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements - IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures has been replaced by IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.
The Group has joint control over Longmartin Properties Limited by virtue of its 50% share in the equity shares of the company and requirement for unanimous consent by both parties over decisions related to the relevant activities of the arrangement.
As a result the Group has assessed Longmartin Properties Limited to be a joint venture under IFRS 11.
Under IAS 31 the Group accounted for its share of its joint ventures results and balance sheet using proportional consolidation.
IFRS 11 precludes the use of proportional consolidation, with equity accounting being the only permitted option.
The Groups net interest in its joint venture is now disclosed as a single line item in both the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and Group Balance Sheet.
Accompanied by this the Group Cash Flow Statement excludes cash flows generated by the joint venture but now includes loans received advanced and dividends received in separate line items.
The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Group Balance Sheet is purely presentational and does not affect the Groups reported net assets nor profit after tax.
Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Cash Flow Statement are reduced by the Groups share of cash held in the joint venture.
As the impact of the transition to IFRS 11 has a material impact on the presentation of the Groups financial statements the prior year figures have been restated.
The tables below show the impact of the change in accounting policy on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet and Group Cash Flow Statement.
Apart from IFRS 11, no material changes to accounting policies arose as a result of these new standards and amendments.

SHAFTESBURY ANNUAL REPORT 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 119 2.
Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint venture, prepared up to the Balance Sheet date.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the financial and operating activities of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision in respect of permanent impairment loss.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
On initial recognition the investment is recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss and dividends of the joint venture after the date of acquisition.
The Groups investment in joint ventures is presented separately on the Balance Sheet and the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the year is also presented separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where there is an indication that the Groups investment in joint ventures may be impaired the Group evaluates the recoverable amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint ventures fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
If the Groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the joint venture.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, the investment in joint venture is stated at cost less any provisions for permanent impairment loss.
Acquisitions Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets other than investment property and liabilities, and without a business being acquired, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In all other cases, the acquisition is treated as a business combination.
Investment properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held to generate rental income or long-term capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are initially recognised on acquisition at cost, including related acquisition costs, and are revalued annually to reflect fair value.
Fair value is determined either by external professional valuers or by the directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the period end.
The fair value, as determined by the valuers, is reduced for any unamortised lease incentive balances held at the Balance Sheet date.
In the case of investment properties which are leasehold interests, such leases are accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is held in the Balance Sheet at fair value, gross of the finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investment properties are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the accounting period in which they arise.
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment properties.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in identifiable future economic benefits which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Amounts received by way of compensation for dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements on the date at which there is a legally binding and unconditional contract.
120 SHAFTESBURY ANNUAL REPORT 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at fair value being the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rate expectations and the current credit rating of the counterparties.
The gain or loss at each fair value remeasurement is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Amounts payable or receivable under such arrangements are included within finance costs or income, recognised on an accruals basis.
Borrowings and costs of raising finance Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Expenses and discounts relating to the issue of long-term debt are deducted from the proceeds and written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the life of the debt instrument using an effective yield method.
Any premium arising on the issue of long-term debt is added to the proceeds and credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the life of the debt instrument using an effective interest method.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and trade payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost.
In the case of trade receivables a provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand bank deposits.
Where such deposits can be offset against any amounts owing to the same bank in accordance with its loan agreement, and in the event of settlement the Group intends to settle as a net liability, they are deducted from that loan liability.
Cash which is held on deposit that has certain conditions restricting its use is assessed to determine whether it meets the IFRS criteria of cash and cash equivalents.
Where it does not meet the definition of being available on demand, liquid or readily convertible, it is classified as other receivables.
Share capital Share capital is classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from retained earnings.
Revenue Revenue comprises rents receivable from tenants under operating leases, recognised on an accruals basis, and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants.
Rents are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Value added tax is excluded from all amounts.
Income arising as a result of rent reviews is recognised when agreement of new terms is reasonably certain.
Premiums receivable from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, unless they arise in connection with a value-enhancing project in which case they are deducted from project costs.
The cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases is spread over the period from the lease commencement date, to the earlier of its expiry date or to the date of the first break option, on a straight-line basis.
Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent free periods.
Property charges Irrecoverable property costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they arise.
Premiums payable to tenants in connection with the surrender of their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, unless they arise in connection with a value-enhancing project in which case they are capitalised.
SHAFTESBURY ANNUAL REPORT 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 121 2.
Accounting policies continued Employee benefits i Share based remuneration The cost of granting share options and other share based remuneration to employees is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income based on the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the net asset value non-market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted using the modified binomial option pricing model.
At the end of each reporting period, the directors review their estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on actual and forecast net asset values.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The fair value of the total shareholder return market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, using various assumptions as set out in note 29.
The fair value is charged on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
No adjustment is made to the original estimate for market based conditions after the date of grant regardless of whether the options vest or not.
The amount charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share based payments reserve.
Following the exercise of share options, the charges previously recognised in respect of these options are released from the share based payments reserve to retained earnings.
ii Pension contributions Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
Leases The Group as lessor Operating leases - all of the Groups leases to its tenants fall within the definition of operating leases, as substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group.
Long leaseholds - where the Group grants residential long leasehold interests to tenants, as substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the tenant, the property is not recognised as an investment property.
Segmental information The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for reviewing the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and the allocation of resources.
The Groups properties, which are all located in Londons West End, are managed as a single portfolio.
Its properties, which are of a similar type, are combined into villages.
All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks.
For the purposes of IFRS 8, each village is considered to be a separate operating segment.
However, in view of the similar characteristics of each village, and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 have been applied to give one reportable segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable segment based on net property income and investment property valuation.
All financial information provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements and, as the Group has only one reportable segment, the measures used in assessing the business are set out in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.

All properties were valued on the basis of fair value and highest and best use in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards - Professional Standards 2014 and IFRS 13.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer considers its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer considers the use a market participant would have in mind when formulating the price it would bid and reflects the cost and likelihood of achieving that use.
The external valuations use information provided by the Group, such as tenancy information and capital expenditure expectations.
The valuers, in forming their opinion make a series of assumptions.
The assumptions are typically market related, such as yields and rental values, and are based on the valuers professional judgement and market observations.
The major inputs to the external valuation are reviewed by the senior management team.
In addition, the valuers meet with external auditors and members of the Audit Committee.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Audit Committee Report on pages 79 to 80.

Investment properties continued Fair value measurements using unobservable inputs level 3 The Groups investment properties are reported under IFRS 13 Fair value measurement which uses the following hierarchy to determine the valuation basis of assets or liabilities: HIERARCHY DESCRIPTION Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine fair values of these instruments.
The fair value of the Groups investment properties has primarily been determined using a Market Approach, which provides an indication of value by comparing the subject asset with identical or similar assets for which price information is available.
There are a number of assumptions that are made in deriving the fair value, including equivalent yields and ERVs.
Equivalent yields are based on current market prices, depending on, inter alia, the location and use of the property.
ERVs are calculated using a number of factors which include current rental income, market comparatives, occupancy and timing of rent reviews.
Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs, and recent transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement.
As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, these significant inputs are deemed unobservable.
The Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within Level 3.
The Groups policy is to recognise transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There have been no transfers during the year.
The key assumptions made by the valuers are set out in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143.
Sensitivity analysis As noted in the critical judgements, assumptions and estimates section of note 1 on page 114, the valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective.
The Groups properties are all located in the West End and are virtually all multi-use buildings, usually configured with commercial uses on the lower floors and office and or residential uses on the upper floors DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited value properties in their entirety and not by use.
Consequently the sensitivity analysis below has been performed on the Groups portfolio as a whole.

All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of a property, and an increase in the ERV would increase the capital value, and vice versa.
At 30 September 2015, the Group had capital commitments of 16.4 million 2014 as restated 15.0 million.

The extent to which the fair value deficit will crystallise will depend on the course of interest rates over the life of the swaps.
The weighted average maturity of the swaps at the Balance Sheet date is set out in note 19.
During the year the Group terminated interest rate swaps with a notional principal of 70.0 million at a cost of 28.1 million.
SHAFTESBURY ANNUAL REPORT 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 133 20.
Financial instruments continued The fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps has been estimated using the mid-point of the relevant yield curve prevailing at the reporting date, and represents the net present value of the differences between the contractual rate and the valuation rate through to the contracted expiry date of the swap contract.
The valuation technique falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy see note 12 for definition.
The 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024 and the Groups secured term loans are held at amortised cost in the Balance Sheet.
The fair value of liability in excess of book value which is not recognised in the reported results for the year is 39.1 million 2014 as restated 22.3 million.
The fair values have been calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using the relevant reference gilt and appropriate market spread.
The Company is not obliged to redeem the 61.0 million nominal of Debenture Stock in issue in advance of its redemption date of 31 March 2024, when repayment will be at par value.
The Group also has no obligation to repay its secured term loans in advance of their maturities on 2 May 2029, 19 March 2030, and 31 July 2035.
Other financial instruments The fair values of the Groups and Companys cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings other than the 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024 and its secured term loans, and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.

Management of financial risk Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 16.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Financial instruments that are neither past due nor impaired are expected to be fully recoverable.
The Group tends to hold minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day-to-day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
Liquidity risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 34 and 56.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long-term fixed rate debt, long-term committed bank facilities and the use of long-term interest rate swaps on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
The Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
Details of the Groups interest and hedging arrangements are set out in note 20.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates on its unhedged LIBOR-linked borrowings and a change in the long-term interest rates against which the fair value of swaps is calculated at the Balance Sheet date.
It represents the directors assessment of possible changes in interest rates and the potential impact on the Groups results and equity.

Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 19 and the Groups equity structure is set out in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group regularly reviews its covenant compliance.
The Groups capital management objectives are to continue as a going concern and to provide enhanced shareholder returns whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The Groups capital structure such as levels of gearing and loan-to-value ratios are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 34 and 56.

RESERVE DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE Share premium Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received for ordinary shares exceeds the nominal value of shares issued, net of expenses.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 2006.
Share based The equity settled remuneration expense charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to payments reserve the share based payments reserve.
Upon exercise of options, the expense previously recognised is transferred to retained earnings.
Retained earnings Cumulative gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transfers from the share based payments reserve and merger reserve are also credited to this account.

For the grant made during the year, the main inputs and assumptions of the models, and the resulting fair values, are as follows: 2006 LTIP Grant date 8.12.14 Share price at date of grant 7.93 Exercise price Nil Expected life - years 3 Performance condition NAV and TSR Assumed return volatility per annum - TSR performance condition 18% Assumed dividend yield per annum 1.65% Risk free discount rate per annum - TSR performance condition 0.98% Assumed index return volatility - TSR performance condition 17% Assumed correlation between the Companys shares and those in the index - TSR performance 0.83 condition Basis of option pricing: NAV performance condition Modified binomial TSR performance condition Monte Carlo Fair values: NAV 7.54 TSR 4.41 The index is the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
The assumed volatility was determined taking into account factors including the historical volatility of the Shaftesbury PLC share price.
Actual future volatility may differ, potentially significantly, from historic volatility.
The vesting conditions relating to options granted under the 2006 LTIP are described in the Annual Remuneration Report on page 95.
