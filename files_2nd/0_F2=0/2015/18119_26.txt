M Employee benefits The company operates two defined benefit pension schemes, being the Clarkson PLC scheme and the Plowrights scheme, which are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
All financial information provided in this note relates to the sum of the two separate schemes.
The schemes assets are invested in a range of pooled pension investment funds managed by professional fund managers.
Defined benefit pension arrangements give rise to open ended commitments and liabilities for the sponsoring company.
As a consequence, the company closed its original defined benefit section of the Clarkson PLC scheme to new entrants on 31 March 2004.
This section was closed to further accrual for all existing members as from 31 March 2006.
The Plowrights scheme was closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
Every three years, a pension scheme must obtain from an actuary a report containing a valuation and a recommendation on rates of contribution.
Triennial valuations for all the schemes have been prepared.
The valuation of the Clarkson PLC scheme showed a pension deficit on the original scheme of 6.1m as at 31 March 2013.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to continue the five year funding plan, which ended on 31 March 2015, at the rate of 1.0m per annum: they have further agreed to continue to fund at this level to 31 December 2016.
The valuation of the Plowrights scheme showed a pension deficit of 2.9m as at 31 March 2013.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to continue the funding plan, which ends on 28 February 2017 at the rate of 0.9m per annum.
The company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Both schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the company pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
com 113 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the parent company financial statements continued M Employee benefits continued Other pension arrangements The company also operates various other defined contribution pension arrangements.
Where required the company also makes contributions into these schemes.
The company incurs no material expenses in the provision of post-retirement benefits other than pensions.

These tables have been adjusted to allow for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy.
Examples of the assumed future life expectancy are given in the table below: Additional years 2015 2014 Post-retirement life expectancy on retirement at age 65: Pensioners retiring in the year male 24.4 24.4 female 25.6 25.6 Pensioners retiring in 20 years time male 26.2 26.1 female 27.5 27.5 Historical comparative information 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 m m m m m Fair value of schemes assets 160.1 163.0 152.7 144.0 138.0 Defined benefit obligations 160.2 173.3 153.6 152.1 141.0 Unrecognised asset 1.1 Minimum funding requirement 1.4 0.9 1.3 2.5 Benefit liability 1.5 10.3 1.8 9.4 6.6 Experience adjustments on schemes assets 2.2 10.2 8.5 3.4 1.9 Experience adjustments on schemes liabilities 11.0 21.4 1.4 0.3 Restated for the effects of IAS 19 revised.
Sensitivities The table below provides information on the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions.
The table shows the impact of changes to each assumption in isolation although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or compound the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation.
These sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as used for the main calculations.
The weighted average duration of the defined obligation is 16 years.
Change in Change in defined benefit assumption obligation Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.5% -7.7% -0.5% 8.5% Price inflation RPI 0.5% 6.1% -0.5% -5.7% An increase of one year in the assumed life expectancy for both males and females would increase the defined benefit obligation by 4.1% 2014: 4.2%.
