Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 95 Notes to accounts Group Notes to accounts Group 31 December 2015 1 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating segments Aerospace & Infrastructure, Communications & Security and Maritime & Land.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and market characteristics.

During the year the Group amended its internal organisation to better reflect the markets that the Group addresses so that business groupings better reflect its capabilities, evolving product offerings and market facing segments.
As a result of this, the composition of the Groups reportable segments has changed.
As such, in line with IFRS 8, the corresponding information for the prior year has been restated.
Previously results were reported as Aircraft & Vehicle Systems, Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems, they are now reported as Aerospace & Infrastructure, Communications & Security and Maritime & Land.

A liquidator was appointed and is pursuing claims against the customer on behalf of the interested parties.
Ithra, upon liquidation, no longer meets the IFRS 10 criteria for consolidation as a subsidiary of the Group and is, consequently, a deemed disposal as at 4 March 2015.
During 2014 the full expected cost of the Oman contract termination of 46,878,000 was charged to the consolidated income statement and impacted the Group's profit for the year in 2014.
The loss attributable to the Oman Investment Corporation OIC non-controlling interest of 14,301,000 was credited to reserves as mandated by IFRS 10 para B94.
Upon deemed disposal, the existing non-controlling interest of 13,751,000 is not permitted to be debited back against reserves, even though the cost has already been reflected in full on the face of the 2014 income statement, and is consequently recycled through the income statement, together with 2,696,000 of foreign exchange losses recorded in the translation reserve over the life of the entity.
The net charge booked to exceptional Oman termination related costs in the 2015 income statement is as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Contract termination provisions - 46,878 Non-controlling interest elimination 13,751 - Release of translation reserve 2,696 - Oman termination related costs 16,447 46,878 8 Staff costs Particulars of employees including Executive Directors are shown below.

Introduction 102 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 14 Goodwill continued 2015 2014 000 000 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 January 49,638 41,873 Exchange differences 2,643 410 Impairment of goodwill - 7,355 Carrying amount at 31 December 375,885 298,960 Other changes in 2015 relate to the re-assessment of initial fair values.
Other changes in 2014 relate to a deferred consideration release relating to a 2006 acquisition and a fair value adjustment relating to a 2013 acquisition.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups Cash Generating Units CGUs which comprise its individual business units.
Goodwill is initially allocated, in the year a business is acquired, to CGUs expected to benefit from the acquisition.
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent operations to which goodwill relates are transferred between CGUs.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a reportable operating segment.
In 2015 the Group amended its internal organisation to better reflect the markets that the Group addresses so that business groupings reflect its capabilities, evolving product offerings and .
The  are: Aerospace, Infrastructure, Nuclear, Communications, C2ISR, Maritime, Land and Underwater Warfare.
The reporting structure has been altered in a way that changes the composition of one or more CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, and consequently goodwill has been reallocated to these .
These represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Previously results were reported as the following divisions: Aircraft & Vehicle Systems, Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems.
They are now reported as Aerospace & Infrastructure, Communications & Security and Maritime & Land.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum.
Cash flows beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross margins.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2015 varied between 10.4% and 12.9% 2014: 10.8% to 13.7%.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historic experience, available government spending data and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates.
Longer-term growth rates, applied for the ten year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%.
Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the sectors in which it operates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development and available markets.
A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultras products and expertise from a number of US government agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to: i reduce the post-2020 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil.
ii apply a 20% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows.
iii consider specific market factors as noted above.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 103 Notes to accounts Group continued 14 Goodwill continued Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to a potential impairment in Infrastructure.
Headroom, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the Infrastructure value-in-use calculations, is 7.2m.
Sensitivity ii results in a 0.5m impairment in Infrastructure: the CGU grouping is sensitive to the ability of the remaining operations to win sufficient new customers over the medium term.
For all other CGUs, the value in use calculations exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
During the prior-year, the value-in-use of the Blue Sky Group CGU was lower than the carrying value of the CGUs net operating assets and consequently an impairment charge of 7.4m was recorded in administrative expenses in 2014.
Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of goodwill for the Blue Sky Group CGU was nil.
As set out in note 2, the 7.4m impairment charge was included in 2014 as part of the non-underlying operating results of the Group.
Blue Sky Group is within the Aerospace & Infrastructure operating segment.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
The impairment charge was incurred in the SOTECH business due to the reduced US domestic legal intercept business following the repeal of the US Patriot Act.
The remaining intangible assets are carried at their value-in-use.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 21 years Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years Other acquired 1 to 5 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Other intangibles: 3 to 5 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years 6.
Included within Land and Buildings is nil 2014: nil of assets in the course of construction.
17 Interest in associate 2015 2014 000 000 The value of the Groups investment is made up as follows: Total assets - 15,085 Total liabilities - 6,980 Interest in associate - 8,105 2015 2014 000 000 Total revenue of associate 3,511 41,340 Groups share of loss profit recognised 581 1,957 The Groups interest in associate is represented by its 49% holding of ordinary shares in Al Shaheen Adventure LLC ASA, a Company incorporated in the UAE.
The Group has significant influence over the entity but does not control it, consequently ASA has been accounted using the equity method of accounting.
The associates year end is 31 December 2015.
During the year Ultra received an interim cash dividend of 5,343,000 and will receive a further final dividend of 2,530,000 upon the receipt by ASA of certain outstanding third-party trade receivables, or 30 June 2017, whichever is earlier.
The declared final dividend has been recorded by the Group in other receivables due in less than 1 year.
On 30 December 2015, the Group reached agreement to transfer the whole of its 49% equity interest in ASA to Emirates Advanced Investments Group EAI.
The carrying amount of the Groups investment in ASA and loan receivable balance see note 33 have been written down to nil at 31 December 2015 to reflect the fair value of the remaining interest.
Consequently, a non-underlying impairment charge of 2,693,000 has been recorded in 2015 as disclosed in note 6.

Introduction 106 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 20 Trade and other receivables continued Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2015 2014 Current 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 1,043 1,605 Foreign exchange differences 24 9 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 217 546 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 277 1,117 Balance at end of year 959 1,043 2015 2014 Non-current 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 6,884 - Decrease Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 6,884 6,884 Balance at end of year - 6,884 Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counter parties and customers, the customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.
As set out in note 7, the Oman Airport IT contract has been terminated.
Specific provisions were recorded against the associated receivables balances.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Groups credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 23 net of any allowances for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Introduction 108 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were three facilities in place.
The first provides 100 million of revolving credit and was due to expire in December 2017: during the year the terms were amended to extend the expiry date to August 2019 and to reduce the applicable margin to match that of the 200 million revolving credit facility.
The second facility, which was put in place in August 2014 provides 200 million of revolving credit which expires in August 2019.
Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A USD225 million term loan facility, which expires in August 2019, was put in place at the time of the Herley acquisition.
The same covenants are in place across the three facilities.
A further 15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 1.00% 2014: 1.00% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had available 159,756,000 2014: 177,956,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS, participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allowed the Group to issue loan notes up to a value of USD150 million and with a maturity date of up to 10 years.
USD10 million of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity date of July 2018 and a further USD60 million of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019.
In January 2014 the Group agreed an amendment to extend the private shelf agreement for a three year period.
Consequently loan notes can now be issued up until 2 January 2017.
The amendment also increased the size of the shelf agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue.
As at 31 December 2014 USD125 million remained available under the shelf agreement.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities: Within 1 to 2 to Over 1 year 2 years 5 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2015 Bank loans and overdrafts 4,923 4,242 299,095 - 308,260 Loan notes 1,701 1,701 48,902 - 52,304 Government loans --- 4,289 4,289 Trade payables 70,701 --- 70,701 Currency derivatives used for hedging 3,530 1,634 927 - 6,091 Deferred consideration 869 3,221 586 - 4,676 Accruals 27,178 842 860 273 29,153 2014 Bank loans and overdrafts 1,563 1,563 125,971 - 129,097 Loan notes 1,615 1,615 48,045 - 51,275 Government loans --- 5,728 5,728 Trade payables 92,855 --- 92,855 Currency derivatives used for hedging 1,920 1,678 -- 3,598 Deferred consideration 3,459 2,234 415 - 6,108 Accruals 25,196 1,853 967 206 28,222 Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2015, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 4,744,000 2014: liability 756,000, comprising 1,347,000 assets 2014: 2,842,000 and 6,091,000 liabilities 2014: 3,598,000.
The loss on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 3,988,000 2014: loss 7,243,000.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 109 Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
The value of the net investment hedge was US$325m 2014: US$120m.
Interest rate risk During the year the Group entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps mature in July 2019 and have a fixed swap rate, including the bank margin, of 1.232%.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR.
At the year end the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US dollar 120m 2014: nil.
The hedging contracts fix US dollar 120m of borrowings to December 2016, reducing to US Dollar 90m by December 2017, US dollar 60m by December 2018 and to US dollar 45m by July 2019.
The interest rate swaps were designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value is charged to equity.
At 31 December 2015, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was 198,000 2014: nil.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was nil and has been charged to interest cost in the year 2014: nil.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next 3.5 years.
The Group also has US dollar 70m of fixed rate debt with Pricoa at an interest rate of 3.60%, due for repayment in July 2018 and January 2019.
The interest rate swaps and fixed rate Pricoa debt were entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.

Introduction 110 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Currency risks The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement and equity of a 10% and 25% strengthening or weakening of average actual and transactional currency rates applicable during the year and a 10% and 25% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable for valuing foreign exchange derivative instruments.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided to UETCS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period to 2030.
Up to $8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2020 to 2033.
The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year.
The fair value of the loans have been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument.
Following delays on some of the UETCS programme, an extension of the funding is under negotiation.
The revised repayment profile and re-assessment of the discount rate has resulted in a reduction of the loan element and increase in the grant element during the year and a reduction in capitalised development.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and development of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Fair value of SADI loan brought forward 5,728 4,337 Contributions 662 687 Re-assessment as grant income 2,249 - Reduction in capitalised development 784 - Interest charged to finance costs 953 823 Foreign exchange differences 21 119 Fair value of SADI loan carried forward 4,289 5,728 Government grants credited to profit in the year 2015 2014 000 000 SADI 3,551 1,709 Other 163 222 3,714 1,931 Ultra Electronics Limited received a 163,000 2014: 222,000 grant from the Technology Strategy Board in the year.

Introduction 114 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 27 Share capital and share options continued The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 March LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2015 Weighted average share price 17.04 17.40 17.41 17.10 Weighted average exercise price 15.89 17.36 17.38 n a Expected volatility % 22.4 25.0 24.2 18.7 Expected option life years 3.5 653 Risk-free interest rate % 0.8 1.6 1.2 0.7 Expected dividends % 2.4 1.8 2.3 0.0 Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2014 Weighted average share price 16.03 17.14 17.44 n a Weighted average exercise price 14.81 17.37 17.40 n a Expected volatility % 24.5 25.3 24.9 n a Expected option life years 3.6 65 n a Risk-free interest rate % 1.1 1.6 1.2 n a Expected dividends % 2.3 1.7 2.2 n a Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 March LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.

Introduction 116 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes Some UK employees of the Group are members of the Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme which was established on 1 March 1994.
The scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1 60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2013.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes and the Swiss business of the Forensic Technology group has a defined benefit scheme.
During 2015 a consultation took place with the members on a proposal to close the UK defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual from 5 April 2016.
Following the end of the consultation and discussion with the Trustee, it was announced to members on 1 February 2016 that the Company had agreed with the Trustee the terms under which the scheme is to be closed and that the proposed closure would go ahead.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 4,765,000 2014: 4,696,000.
Defined benefit schemes All the defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2015 using the projected unit method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company.
Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the schemes membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company.
The Trustees are also responsible for the investment of the schemes assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death.
Members who leave service before retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.
Active members of the scheme pay contributions via salary sacrifice and the Company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular actuarial valuations.
The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk: inflation risk: investment risk and longevity risk.
The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies.
The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 6 April 2013.
The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2016.
These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence.
This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2013 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland UK Canada Switzerland 2015 2015 2015 2014 2014 2014 Discount rate 3.75% 3.75% 0.80% 3.65% 3.65% 1.50% Inflation rate RPI 3.05% 3.05% 0.80% 3.05% 3.05% 1.40% Inflation rate CPI 2.05% 2.05% 0.80% 2.05% 2.05% 1.40% Expected rate of salary increases 3.30% 3.30% 1.00% 3.30% 3.30% 1.00% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 2.85% n a n a 2.85% 3.05% 1.40% Future pension increases post 6 4 08 1.90% n a n a 1.90% n a n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.15% and a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate to 3.65% would increase the schemes liabilities by 1.4% and 1.9% respectively.
If the members life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 3.3%.
The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 20 years 2014: 19 years.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely: Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2015 2014 Current pensioners at 65 males 22 years 22 years Current pensioners at 65 females 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 males 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 females 26 years 26 years Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 117 Notes to accounts Group continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes continued Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland Total UK Canada Switzerland Total 2015 2015 2015 2015 2014 2014 2014 2014 m m m m m m m m Current service cost 4.9 0.1 0.3 5.3 4.9 0.1 0.1 5.1 Administration expenses 0.5 0.1 - 0.6 0.5 0.1 - 0.6 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 11.2 0.3 0.1 11.6 12.0 0.4 - 12.4 Expected return on pension scheme assets 8.2 0.3 0.1 8.6 8.4 0.4 - 8.8 8.4 0.2 0.3 8.9 9.0 0.2 0.1 9.3 Of the current service cost for the year, 3.9 million 2014: 3.8 million has been included in cost of sales, and 1.4 million 2014: 1.3 million has been included in administrative expenses.

34 Non-controlling interests The following table summarises the information, before any intra-group eliminations, relating to the Groups former subsidiary Ultra Electronics in Collaboration with Oman Investment Corporation, incorporated in the Sultanate of Oman, that had a material non-controlling interest held by Oman Investment Corporation OIC.
On 4 March 2015 the entity was placed into voluntary liquidation and no longer meets the IFRS 10 criteria for consolidation as a subsidiary of the Group see note 7.

The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise.
In addition, the Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
In particular, as set out in note 7, the Oman Airport IT contract was terminated in February 2015.
This has given rise to significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of negotiations in respect of this termination event, and it is not possible at this early stage to reliably estimate the outcome.
36 Assets classified as held for sale The Group is in advanced discussions to dispose of a small non-core part of the Communications & Security division.
These operations, which are expected to be sold within 12 months, have been classified on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities held for sale.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to substantially exceed the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of these operations as held for sale.
