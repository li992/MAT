Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Own equity instruments Treasury shares The groups holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders equity at cost.
Treasury shares represent BP shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes.
For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares.
Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity, withany difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to the profit and loss account reserve.
No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not shown as treasury shares, but are shown as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.
Revenue Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, which is typically at the point that title passes, and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Physical exchanges are reported net, as are sales and purchases made with a common counterparty, as part of an arrangement similar to a physical exchange.
Similarly, where the group acts as agent on behalf of a third party to procure or market energy commodities, any associated fee income is recognized but no purchase or sale is recorded.
Additionally, where forward sale and purchase contracts for oil, natural gas or power have been determined to be for trading purposes, the associated sales and purchases are reported net within sales and other operating revenues whether or not physical delivery has occurred.
Generally, revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which the group has an interest with joint operation partners are recognized on the basis of the groups working interest in those properties the entitlement method.
Differences between the production sold and the groups share of production are not significant.
Finance costs Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
All other finance costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards There are no new or amended standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Not yet adopted The following pronouncements from the IASB will become effective for future financial reporting periods and have not yet been adopted by the group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will supersede IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 covers classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment methodology and hedge accounting.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers provides a single model for accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 will supersede IAS 18 Revenue.
The IASB has issued IFRS 16 Leases which provides a new model for lease accounting in which all leases, other than short-term and small-ticket-item leases, will be accounted for by the recognition on the balance sheet of a right-to-use asset and a lease liability, and the subsequent amortization of the right-to-use asset over the lease term.
IFRS 16 will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and is expected to have a significant effect on the groups financial statements, significantly increasing the groups recognized assets and liabilities and potentially affecting the presentation and timing of recognition of charges in the income statement.
Information on the groups leases currently classified as operating leases, which are not recognized on the balance sheet, is provided in Note 27.
BP does not expect to adopt IFRS 9 or IFRS 15 before 1 January 2018 and has not yet determined its date of adoption for IFRS 16.
The group has not yet completed its evaluation of the effect of adoption of these standards.
The EU has not yet adopted IFRS 9, IFRS 15 or IFRS 16.
There are no other standards and interpretations in issue but not yet adopted that the directors anticipate will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the group.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in April 2010, BP continues to incur costs and has also recognized liabilities for certain future costs.
Liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, for which no provision has been made, have been disclosed as contingent liabilities.
The cumulative pre-tax income statement charge since the incident amounts to $55.5 billion.
For more information on the types of expenditure included in the cumulative income statement charge, see Impact upon the group income statement below.
The cumulative income statement charge does not include amounts for obligations that BP considers are not possible, at this time, to measure reliably.
For further information, including developments in relation to business economic loss claims under the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC settlement, see Provisions and contingent liabilities below.
On 2 July 2015, agreements in principle to settle all federal and state claims and claims made by more than 400 local government entities were signed.
These agreements in principle were subject to execution of definitive agreements, including a Consent Decree with the United States and Gulf states with respect to the Clean Water Act penalty and natural resource damages and other claims, a Settlement Agreement with five Gulf states with respect to state claims for economic loss, property damage and other claims, and resolution to BPs satisfaction of the economic loss, property damage and other claims with more than 400 local government entities.
The proposed Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states and BP was available for public comment until early December 2015 and is subject to final court approval.
The Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement with the five Gulf states are conditional upon each other and neither will become effective unless there is final court approval of the Consent Decree.
The United States is expected to file a motion with the court to enter the Consent Decree as a final settlement around the end of March, which the court will then consider.
During 2015, the Settlement Agreement with the five Gulf states was executed.
BP has accepted releases received from the vast majority of local government entities and payments required under those releases were made during 2015.
For more information on the proposed Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement see Legal proceedings on page 238.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 117 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued The agreements described above the Agreements significantly reduce the uncertainties faced by BP following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.
There continues to be uncertainty regarding the outcome or resolution of current or future litigation and the extent and timing of costs relating to the incident not covered by the Agreements.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to the incident will be dependent on many factors, as discussed under Provisions and contingent liabilities below, including in relation to any new information or future developments.
These uncertainties could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results and cash flows.
The impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the group are included within the relevant line items in those statements and are shown in the table below.
$ million 2015 2014 2013 Income statement Production and manufacturing expenses 11,709 781 430 Profit loss before interest and taxation 11,709 781 430 Finance costs 247 38 39 Profit loss before taxation 11,956 819 469 Less: Taxation 3,492 262 73 Profit loss for the period 8,464 557 396 Balance sheet Current assets Trade and other receivables 686 1,154 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 693 655 Accruals 40 Provisions 3,076 1,702 Net current assets liabilities 3,123 1,203 Non-current assets Other receivables 2,701 Non-current liabilities Other payables 2,057 2,412 Accruals 186 169 Provisions 13,431 6,903 Deferred tax 5,200 1,723 Net non-current assets liabilities 10,474 5,060 Net assets liabilities 13,597 6,263 Cash flow statement Profit loss before taxation 11,956 819 469 Finance costs 247 38 39 Net charge for provisions, less payments 11,296 939 1,129 Increase decrease in other current and non-current assets 662 1,481 Increase decrease in other current and non-current liabilities 732 792 618 Pre-tax cash flows 1,145 1,296 1,400 The impact on net cash provided by operating activities, on a post-tax basis, amounted to an outflow of $1,130 million 2014 outflow of $9 million and 2013 outflow of $73 million.
Trust fund BP established the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust the Trust, funded in the amount of $20 billion, to satisfy legitimate individual and business claims, state and local government claims resolved by BP, final judgments and settlements, state and local response costs, and natural resource damages and related costs.
Fines and penalties are not covered by the trust fund.
The funding of the Trust was completed in 2012.
The obligation to fund the $20-billion trust fund, adjusted to take account of the time value of money, was recognized in full in 2010 and charged to the income statement.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the $20-billion trust fund are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds.
An asset has been recognized representing BPs right to receive reimbursement from the trust fund.
We use the term reimbursement asset to describe this asset.
BP does not actually receive any reimbursements from the trust fund, instead payments are made directly from the trust fund, and BP is released from its corresponding obligation.
This is the portion of the estimated future expenditure provided for that will be settled by payments from the trust fund.
During 2014, cumulative charges to be paid by the Trust reached $20 billion.
Subsequent additional costs, over and above those provided within the $20 billion, are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
At 31 December 2015, $686 million of the provisions and payables are eligible to be paid from the Trust.
The reimbursement asset is recorded within Trade and other receivables on the balance sheet, all of which is classified as current, as payment of all amounts covered by the remaining reimbursement asset may be requested during 2016.
During 2015, $3,022 million of provisions and $147 million of payables were paid from the Trust.
At 31 December 2015, the remaining cash in the Trust not allocated for specific purposes was $25 million.
This unallocated amount was exhausted in January 2016 and BP commenced paying claims and other costs not covered by the specific-purpose cash balances.
The total cash remaining in the Trust and associated qualifying settlement funds, amounting to $1.4 billion, includes $0.7 billion in the seafood compensation fund, $0.2 billion held for natural resource damage early restoration projects and $0.5 billion held in relation to certain other specified costs under the PSC settlement.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Other payables BP reached an agreement with the US government in 2012, which was approved by the court in 2013, to resolve all federal criminal claims arising from the incident.
At 31 December 2015, $2,432 million remains in Other payables in relation to this agreement, of which $530 million falls due in 2016.
In addition, Other payables at 31 December 2015 includes the remaining $219 million for BPs commitment to fund the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, which is a 10-year research programme to study the impact of the incident on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions BP has recorded provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in relation to environmental expenditure including spill response costs, litigation and claims, and Clean Water Act penalties that can be measured reliably at this time.
Movements in each class of provision during the year and cumulatively since the incident are presented in the tables below.
$ million 2015 Litigation Clean Water Environmental and claims Act Total At 1 January 1,141 3,954 3,510 8,605 Increase in provision 5,393 5,832 661 11,886 Unwinding of discount 94 50 68 212 Change in discount rate 149 74 110 333 Reclassified to other payables 459 125 584 Utilization paid by BP 23 234 257 paid by the trust fund 78 2,944 3,022 At 31 December 5,919 6,459 4,129 16,507 Of which current 227 2,849 3,076 non-current 5,692 3,610 4,129 13,431 $ million Cumulative since the incident Litigation Clean Water Environmental and claims Act Total Net increase in provision 19,992 32,427 4,171 56,590 Unwinding of discount 107 56 68 231 Change in discount rate 130 74 110 314 Reclassified to other payables 459 4,408 4,867 Utilization paid by BP 11,710 4,314 16,024 paid by the trust fund 1,881 17,228 19,109 At 31 December 2015 5,919 6,459 4,129 16,507 Environmental The environmental provision at 31 December 2015 includes amounts payable for natural resource damage costs under the proposed Consent Decree.
These amounts are payable in instalments over 16 years commencing one year after the court approves the Consent Decree: the majority of the unpaid balance of this natural resource damages settlement accrues interest at a fixed rate.
During 2011, BP entered into a framework agreement with natural resource trustees for the United States and five Gulf states, providing for $1 billion to be spent on early restoration projects to address natural resource injuries resulting from the oil spill, to be funded from the $20-billion trust fund.
Remaining amounts payable under this framework agreement, that are not yet allocated to specific projects, are also included in environmental provisions.
Litigation and claims The litigation and claims provision includes amounts that can be estimated reliably for the future cost of settling claims by individuals and businesses for damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity and loss of subsistence use of natural resources Individual and Business Claims, and amounts provided under the Agreements in relation to state claims that have not yet been paid.
Claims administration costs and legal costs have also been provided for.
Litigation and claims PSC settlement The Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement EPD Settlement Agreement with the PSC provides for a court-supervised settlement programme, the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP, which commenced operation on 4 June 2012.
A separate claims administrator has been appointed to pay medical claims and to implement other aspects of the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement.
For further information on the PSC settlements, see Legal proceedings on page 239.
BP has provided for its best estimate of the cost associated with the PSC settlement agreements with the exception of the cost of business economic loss claims, which are provided for where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility.
Management believes that no reliable estimate can currently be made of any business economic loss claims not yet processed or processed but not yet paid, except where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility.
The submission deadline for business economic loss claims passed on 8 June 2015: no further claims may be submitted.
A significant number of business economic loss claims have been received but have not yet been processed and it is not possible to quantify the total value of the claims.
A revised policy for the matching of revenue and expenses for business economic loss claims was introduced in May 2014 and, of the claims assessable under the revised policy, the majority have not yet been determined at this time.
Uncertainties regarding the proper application of the revised policy to particular claims and categories of claims continue to arise as the claims administrator has applied the revised policy.
Only a small proportion of claim determinations have been made under some of the specialized frameworks that have been put in place for particular industries, namely construction, agriculture, professional services and education, and so determinations to date may not be representative of the total population BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 119 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued of claims.
In addition, although some pre-determination data has been provided to BP, detailed data on the majority of pre-determination claims is not available due to a court order to protect claimant confidentiality.
Therefore, there is an insufficient level of detail to enable a complete or clear understanding of the composition of the underlying claims population.
There is insufficient data available to build up a track record of claims determinations under the policies and protocols that are now being applied following resolution of the matching and causation issues.
We are unable to reliably estimate future trends of the number and proportion of claims that will be determined to be eligible, nor can we reliably estimate the value of such claims.
A provision for such business economic loss claims will be established when these uncertainties are sufficiently reduced and a reliable estimate can be made of the liability.
The current estimate for the total cost of those elements of the PSC settlement that BP considers can be reliably estimated, including amounts already paid, is $12.4 billion.
Prior to the end of the month following the balance sheet date, the DHCSSP had issued eligibility notices, many of which are disputed by BP, in respect of business economic loss claims of approximately $402 million which have not been provided for.
The total cost of the PSC settlement is likely to be significantly higher than the amount recognized to date of $12.4 billion because the current estimate does not reflect business economic loss claims not yet processed, or processed but not yet paid, except where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility.
There continues to be a high level of uncertainty with regards to the amounts that ultimately will be paid in relation to current claims as described above and there is also uncertainty as to the cost of administering the claims process under the DHCSSP and in relation to future legal costs.
The timing of payment of provisions related to the PSC settlement is dependent upon ongoing claims facility activity and is therefore also uncertain.
Litigation and claims Other claims The provision recognized for litigation and claims includes amounts agreed under the Agreements in relation to state claims.
The amount provided in respect of state claims is payable over 18 years from the date the court approves the Consent Decree, of which $1 billion is due following the court approval of the Consent Decree.
The vast majority of local government entities who filed claims have issued releases, which were accepted by BP: amounts due under those releases were paid during 2015.
Clean Water Act penalties A provision has been recognized for penalties under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as determined in the Agreements.
The amount is payable in instalments over 15 years, commencing one year after the court approves the Consent Decree.
The unpaid balance of this penalty accrues interest at a fixed rate.
Provision movements The total amount recognized as an increase in provisions during the year was $11,886 million.
This increase relates primarily to amounts provided for the Agreements, and additional increases in the litigation and claims provision for business economic loss claims, associated claims administration costs and other items.
After deducting amounts utilized during the year totalling $3,279 million, comprising payments from the trust fund of $3,022 million and payments made directly by BP of $257 million 2014 $2,071 million, comprising payments from the trust fund of $1,681 million and payments made directly by BP of $390 million, and after adjustments for discounting, the remaining provision as at 31 December 2015 was $16,507 million 2014 $8,605 million.
Contingent liabilities BP has provided for its best estimate of amounts expected to be paid that can be measured reliably.
It is not possible, at this time, to measure reliably other obligations arising from the incident, nor is it practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment.
Therefore, no amounts have been provided for these obligations as at 31 December 2015. Business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement The potential cost of business economic loss claims not yet processed and paid except where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility is not provided for and is disclosed as a contingent liability.
A significant number of business economic loss claims have been received but have not yet been processed and paid.
See Provisions above for further information.
Securities-related litigation Proceedings relating to securities class actions MDL 2185 pending in federal court in Texas, including a purported class action on behalf of purchasers of American Depositary Shares under US federal securities law, are continuing.
A jury trial is scheduled to begin in July 2016 and the timing of any outflow of resources, if any, is dependent on the duration of the court process.
No reliable estimate can be made of the amounts that may be payable in relation to these proceedings, if any, so no provision has been recognized at 31 December 2015.
In addition, no reliable estimate can be made of the amounts that may be payable in relation to any other securities litigation, if any, so no provision has been recognized at 31 December 2015.
Other litigation In addition to the securities class actions described above, BP is named as a defendant in approximately 2,700 other civil lawsuits brought by individuals and corporations in US federal and state courts, as well as certain non-US jurisdictions, resulting from the Deepwater Horizon accident, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and the spill response efforts.
Further actions may still be brought.
Among other claims, these lawsuits assert claims for personal injury in connection with the accident and the spill response, commercial and economic injury, damage to real and personal property, breach of contract and violations of statutes, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of US securities and environmental statutes.
In addition, claims have been received, primarily from business claimants, under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 in relation to the 2010 federal deepwater drilling moratoria.
Furthermore, there are also uncertainties around the outcomes of any further litigation including by parties excluded from, or parties who opted out of, the PSC settlement.
Until further fact and expert disclosures occur, court rulings clarify the issues in dispute, liability and damage trial activity nears or progresses, or other actions such as further possible settlements occur, it is not possible given these uncertainties to arrive at a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of the liabilities that may accrue to BP in connection with or as a result of these lawsuits, nor is it possible to determine the timing of any payment that may arise.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items as at 31 December 2015.
Settlement and other agreements Under the settlement agreements with Anadarko and MOEX, the other working interest owners in the Macondo well at the time of the incident, and with Cameron International, the designer and manufacturer of the Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer, BP has agreed to indemnify Anadarko, MOEX and Cameron for certain claims arising from the accident.
It is therefore possible that BP may face claims under these indemnities, but it is not currently possible to reliably measure, nor identify the timing of, any obligation in relation to such claims and therefore no amount has been provided as at 31 December 2015.
There are also agreements indemnifying certain third-party contractors in relation to litigation costs and certain other claims.
A contingent liability also exists in relation to other obligations under these agreements.
120 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 Financial statements 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued The magnitude and timing of all possible obligations in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill continue to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
Any such possible obligations are therefore contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timingof payment.
Furthermore, other material unanticipated obligations may arise in future in relation to the incident.
Impact upon the group income statement The amount of the provision recognized during the year can be reconciled to the charge to the income statement as follows: $ million Cumulative since 2015 2014 2013 the incident Net increase in provision 11,886 1,327 1,860 56,591 Change in discount rate relating to provisions 333 2 5 314 Costs charged directly to the income statement 156 114 136 4,514 Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discounting relating to trust fund liability 283 Recognition of reimbursement asset, net 662 1,542 20,000 Settlements credited to the income statement 19 5,681 Profit loss before interest and taxation 11,709 781 430 54,973 Finance costs 247 38 39 478 Profit loss before taxation 11,956 819 469 55,451 The group income statement for 2015 includes a pre-tax charge of $11,956 million 2014 pre-tax charge of $819 million in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The costs charged within production and manufacturing expenses in 2015 include $9.4 billion for the amounts provided under the Agreements, as well as the ongoing costs of operating the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization GCRO, business economic loss claims, claims administration costs, legal and litigation costs.
Finance costs of $247 million 2014 $38 million reflect the unwinding of the discount on payables and provisions.
The cumulative amount charged to the income statement to date comprises spill response costs arising in the aftermath of the incident, amounts charged for the Agreements, GCRO operating costs, amounts charged upon initial recognition of the trust obligation, litigation, claims, environmental and legal costs not paid through the Trust and estimated obligations for future costs that can be estimated reliably at this time, net of settlements agreed with the co-owners of the Macondo well and other third parties.
