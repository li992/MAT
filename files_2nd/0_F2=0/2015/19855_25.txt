Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Section 6: Acquisitions and disposals 6.1 Acquisitions Growth through acquisitions is one of the Groups priorities in order to deliver its Event First strategy.
Further details of the Groups strategy are provided in the Strategic Report on pages 18 to 19.
The Group completed three acquisitions during 2015 of which Hospitalar Feiras Congressos E Empreendimentos Ltda Hospitalar was significant 2014: four acquisitions of which Advanstar Communications Advanstar was particularly significant.
All values in relation to Hospitalar are provisional as at 31 December 2015.
Accounting policy The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred is measured at the amount of cash and cash equivalents transferred, the fair value of any equity instruments transferred and the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is classified as a financial liability that is within the scope of IAS 39 are recognised in profit or loss.
The Group recognises the fair values of the assets acquired, the liabilities including contingent liabilities assumed, and the equity interests issued by the Group.
For significant acquisitions, management is assisted by external advisors in identifying and measuring the fair values of any intangible assets acquired.
On an  basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value under the full goodwill method or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
When the full goodwill method is used, the fair value of the non-controlling interest is measured using a multiples approach adjusted for the discount that market participants would expect for the lack of control.
Acquisition costs incurred are recognised as an expense in profit or loss and classified as exceptional items.
If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying amount of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
When there is a change in ownership of a subsidiary without a change in control, the difference between the consideration paid received and the relevant share of the carrying amount of net assets acquired disposed of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
All 2015 and 2014 acquisitions where less than 100% of the voting rights of a company were purchased have been accounted for using the full goodwill method.
