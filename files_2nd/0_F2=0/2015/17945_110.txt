For all other financial instruments, the carrying amount is either the fair value, or approximates the fair value.
Financial risk factors The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The group financial risk committee GFRC advises the group chief financial officer CFO who oversees the management of these risks.
The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the group treasurer and the heads of the group finance, tax and the integrated supply and trading functions.
The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group.
The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the group chief executive GCE, and via the GCE to the board, that the groups financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordancewith group policies and group risk appetite.
The groups trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the integrated supply and trading function, while the activities in the financial markets are managed by the treasury function, working under the compliance and control structure of the integrated supply and trading function.
All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision.
Theseteams are subject to close financial and management control.
The integrated supply and trading function maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operationalrisk associated with trading activity.
A policy and risk committee monitors and validates limits and risk exposures, reviews incidents and validates riskrelated policies, methodologies and procedures.
A commitments committee approves value-at-risk delegations, the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the integrated supply and trading function undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described more fully below.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business.
The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The group enters into derivatives in a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation.
In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures.
In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.
The major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.
148 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 Financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued i Commodity price risk The groups integrated supply and trading function uses conventional financial and commodity instruments and physical cargoes and pipeline positions available in the related commodity markets.
Oil and natural gas swaps, options and futures are used to mitigate price risk.
Power trading is undertaken using a combination of over-the-counter forward contracts and other derivative contracts, including options and futures.
This activity is on both a standalone basis and in conjunction with gas derivatives in relation to gas-generated power margin.
In addition, NGLs are traded around certain US inventory locations using over-the-counter forward contracts in conjunction with over-the-counter swaps, options and physical inventories.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions in liquid periods using value-at-risk techniques.
These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period.
The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing.
Trading activity occurring in liquid periods is subject to value-at-risk limits for each trading activity and for this trading activity in total.
The board has delegated a limit of $100 million value at risk in support of this trading activity.
Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are outside liquid periods and which cannot be actively risk-managed.
ii Foreign currency exchange risk Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-atrisk techniques as explained above.
Since BP has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the groups reported results.
The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions.
For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the groups reported results.
The main underlying economic currency of the groups cash flows is the US dollar.
This is because BPs major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars.
BPs foreign currency exchange management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar.
The group co-ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible, and then managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
The group manages these exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million.
At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit.
The most significant exposures relate to capital expenditure commitments and other UK, Eurozone and Australian operational requirements, for which hedging programmes are in place and hedge accounting is applied as outlined in Note 1.
For highly probable forecast capital expenditures the group locks in the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards and futures.
The main exposures are sterling, euro, Australian dollar and South Korean won.
At 31 December 2015 the most significant open contracts in place were for $627 million sterling 2014 $321 million sterling.
For other UK, Eurozone and Australian operational requirements the group uses cylinders purchased call and sold put options to manage the estimated exposures on a 12-month rolling basis.
At 31 December 2015, the open positions relating to cylinders consisted of receive sterling, pay US dollar cylinders for $2,479 million 2014 $2,787 million : receive euro, pay US dollar cylinders for $560 million 2014 $867 million : receive Australian dollar, pay US dollar cylinders for $312 million 2014 $418 million.
In addition, most of the groups borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar.
At 31 December 2015, the total foreign currency net borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $826 million 2014 $871 million.
iii Interest rate risk Where the group enters into money market contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using value-at-risk techniques as described above.
BP is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt.
While the group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the debt to a floating rate exposure, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt.
The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2015 was 79% of total finance debt outstanding 2014 71%.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2015 was 2% 2014 2% and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt was five years 2014 four years.
The groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate element of the groups finance debt.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments were to have increased by one percentage point on 1 January 2016, it is estimated that the groups finance costs for 2016 would increase by approximately $419 million 2014 $377 million increase.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss tothe group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables.
Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2015 was $35 million 2014 $83 million in respect of liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $163 million 2014 $244 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk.
Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business.
On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered.
Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk: the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported: and the timely identification and reporting of any non-approved credit exposures and credit losses.
While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, the treasury function holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount.
The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses.
As at 31 December 2015, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $10.9 billion of credit risk 2014 $10.8 billion.
Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the groups overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued Management information used to monitor credit risk indicates that 81% 2014 82% of total unmitigated credit exposure relates to counterparties of investment-grade credit quality.

Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements The following table shows the amounts recognized for financial assets and liabilities which are subject to offsetting arrangements on a gross basis, and the amounts offset in the balance sheet.
Amounts which cannot be offset under IFRS, but which could be settled net under the terms of master netting agreements if certain conditions arise, and collateral received or pledged, are also presented in the table to show the total net exposure of the group.

The groups liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function.
Unless restricted by local regulations, generally subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to treasury, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the groups overall net currency positions.
Standard & Poors Ratings long-term credit rating for BP is A negative stable outlook and Moodys Investors Service rating is A2 rating under review from positive.
During 2015, $8 billion of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from 1 to 11 years.
Commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.
As a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $26.4 billion at 31 December 2015 2014 $29.8 billion, primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice.
At 31 December 2015, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of $7,375 million of standby facilities, of which $6,975 million is available to draw and repay until the first half of 2018, and $400 million is available to draw and repay until April 2017.
These facilities were renegotiated during 2015 with 26 international banks, and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group also has committed letter of credit LC facilities totalling $6,850 million with a number of banks, allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum two-year duration.
There were also uncommitted secured LC facilities in place at 31 December 2015 for $2,410 million, which are secured against inventories or receivables when utilized.
The facilities only terminate by either party giving a stipulated termination notice to the other.
