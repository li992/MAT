Financials 195 E: Financial assets and liabilities This section outlines the classification and measurement basis of financial assets and liabilities of the Group and provides further information on those instruments that are recognised at fair value and the fair value of instruments measured at amortised cost.
The Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets investments and loans, financial liabilities investment contracts, customer deposits and borrowings, reinsurance assets and insurance liabilities.
Section F of the financial statements discusses the financial risk management of the Group and should be read in conjunction with the Risks Section set out on pages 82 to 97 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Section E of the financial statement provides a detailed analysis of the composition of the individual financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
The Groups accounting policies on financial assets and liabilities are included in note L1.
E1: Categories of financial instruments The analysis of assets and liabilities into their categories as defined in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is set out in the following table.
Assets and liabilities of a non-financial nature, or financial assets and liabilities that are specifically excluded from the scope of IAS 39, are reflected in the non-financial assets and liabilities category.
All gains and losses on measuring the financial assets and liabilities at each reporting date are included in the determination of profit or loss for the year, with the exception of unrealised gains or losses on financial assets classified as available for sale, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.

OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 197 E2: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities a Determination of fair value The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market.
In the event that the market for a financial asset or liability is not active, or quoted prices cannot be obtained without undue effort, another valuation technique is used.
In general, the following inputs are taken into account when evaluating the fair value of financial instruments: Assessing whether instruments are trading with sufficient frequency and volume, that they can be considered liquid The inclusion of a measure of the counterparties non-performance risk in the fair-value measurement of loans and advances, which involves the modelling of dynamic credit spreads The inclusion of credit valuation adjustment CVA and debit valuation adjustment DVA in the fair-value measurement of derivative instruments, and The inclusion of own credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of financial liabilities.
There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques applied when valuing financial instruments.
The general principles applied to those instruments measured at fair value are outlined below: Reinsurers share of policyholder liabilities Reinsurers share of policyholder liabilities are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the provisions held in respect of the related insurance contracts.
Loans and advances Loans and advances include mortgage loans, other asset-based loans, including collateralised debt obligations, and other secured and unsecured loans.
In the absence of an observable market for these instruments, the fair value is determined by using internally developed models that are specific to the instrument and that incorporate all available observable inputs.
These models involve discounting the contractual cash flows by using a credit-adjusted zero-coupon rate.
Investments and securities Investments and securities include government and  securities, listed and unlisted debt securities, preference shares and debentures, listed and unlisted equity securities, listed and unlisted pooled investments see below, short-term funds and securities treated as investments and certain other securities.
Pooled investments represent the Groups holdings of shares units in open-ended investment companies, unit trusts, mutual funds and similar investment vehicles.
Pooled investments are recognised at fair value.
The fair values of pooled investments are based on widely published prices that are regularly updated or models based on the market prices of investments held in the underlying pooled investment funds.
Other investment and securities that are measured at fair value are measured at observable market prices where available.
In the absence of observable market prices, these investments and securities are fair valued utilising one or more of the following techniques: discounted cash flows, the application of an EBITDA multiple or any other relevant technique.
Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures are valued using appropriate valuation techniques.
These may include price earnings multiples, discounted cash flows or the adjusted value of similar completed transactions.
Derivatives The fair value of derivatives is determined with reference to the exchange traded prices of the specific instruments.
In situations where the derivatives are traded over the counter the fair value of the instruments is determined by the utilisation of option pricing models.
Investment contract liabilities The fair value of the investment contract liabilities is determined with reference to the underlying funds that are held by the Group.
Third-party interests in consolidation of funds Third-party interests in consolidation of funds are measured at the attributable net asset value of each fund.
Amounts owed to bank depositors The fair values of amounts owed to bank depositors correspond with the carrying amount shown in the statement of financial position, which generally reflects the amount payable on demand.
Borrowed funds The fair values of amounts included in borrowed funds are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date where applicable, or by reference to quoted prices of similar instruments.
Other financial assets and liabilities The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities which comprise cash and cash equivalents, cash with central banks, other assets and liabilities are reasonably approximated by the carrying amounts reflected in the statement of financial position as they are short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently.

Description of hierarchy Types of instruments classified in the respective levels Level 1 quoted market prices: financial assets and liabilities with Listed equity securities, government securities and other listed debt quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
securities and similar instruments, actively traded pooled investments, certain quoted derivative assets and liabilities, listed borrowed funds and investment contract liabilities directly linked to other Level 1 financial assets.
Level 2 valuation techniques using observable inputs: financial Unlisted equity and debt securities where the valuation is based on assets and liabilities with quoted prices for similar instruments in models involving no significant unobservable data.
active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments Certain loans and advances, certain privately placed debt in inactive markets and financial assets and liabilities valued using instruments, third-party interests in consolidated funds and amounts models where all significant inputs are observable.
Level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable Unlisted equity and securities with significant unobservable inputs, inputs: financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation securities where the market is not considered sufficiently active, techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
including certain inactive pooled investments, and derivatives embedded in certain portfolios of insurance contracts where the derivative is not closely related to the host contract and the valuation contains significant unobservable inputs.
The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, for example, consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid offer spreads.
In inactive markets, obtaining assurance that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value for determining the adjustments to transaction prices that are necessary to measure the fair value of the asset or liability requires additional work during the valuation process.
The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable data and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high.
However, certain financial assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant inputs that are unobservable and, for them, the derivation of fair value is more judgemental.
A financial asset or liability in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if a significant proportion of that asset or liabilitys carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs.
In this context, unobservable means that there is little or no current market data available for which to determine the price at which an arms-length transaction would be likely to occur.
It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value.
Furthermore, in some cases the majority of the fair value derived from a valuation technique with significant unobservable data may be attributable to observable inputs.
Consequently, the effect of uncertainty in determining unobservable inputs will generally be restricted to uncertainty about the overall fair value of the asset or liability being measured.
c Transfer between fair value hierarchies The Group deems a transfer to have occurred between Level 1 and Level 2 when an active, traded primary market ceases to exist for that financial instrument.
A transfer between Level 2 and Level 3 occurs when the majority of the significant inputs used to determine fair value of the instrument become unobservable.

When parameters are not amenable to statistical analysis, quantification of uncertainty is judgemental.
When the fair value of a financial asset or liability is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the figures shown reflect the most favourable or most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.
The valuations of the private equity investments are performed on an asset-by-asset basis using a valuation methodology appropriate to the specific investment and in line with industry guidelines.
In determining the valuation of the investment the principal assumption used is the valuation multiple applied to the main financial indicators such as adjusted earnings.
The source of these multiples may include multiples for comparable listed companies which have been adjusted for discounts for non-tradability and valuation multiples earned on transactions in comparable sectors.
The valuation of asset-backed securities are determined by discounted cash flow models that generate the expected value of the asset, incorporating benchmark information on factors such as prepayment patterns, default rates, loss severities and the historical performance of the underlying assets.
The outputs from the models used are calibrated with reference to similar securities for which external market information is available.
Structured notes and other derivatives are generally valued using option pricing models.
For structured notes and other derivatives, principal assumptions concern the future volatility of asset values and the future correlation between asset values.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of structured credit notes include credit volatilities and correlations.
For such unobservable assumptions, estimates are based on available market data, which may include the use of a proxy method to derive a volatility or correlation from comparable assets for which market data is more readily available, and examination of historical levels.
Details of the valuation techniques applied to the different categories of financial instruments can be found in note E2: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities.

Alternative assumptions are assessed in terms of possible favourable and unfavourable changes in the key market inputs for the major types of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, ranging from, for example, a 13% change in the price earnings multiple for equity securities, to a 13% change in the discount rates applied to debt securities and volatility assumptions in derivative contracts.
Changes in business risk inputs such as lapses and non-performance risk were also considered.
Management believes that in aggregate, 25% 2014: 15% of the amounts determined in the sensitivity tables represents a reasonable possible alternative judgement in the context of the current macro-economic environment in which the Group operates.
It is therefore considered that the impact of alternative assumptions will be in the range of 38 million 2014: 32 million favourable to 37 million 2014: 30 million unfavourable on profit or loss and assets.
The impact on liabilities will be in the range of 14 million 2014: 11 million favourable and 15 million 2014: 12 million unfavourable.
E4: Financial instruments designated as fair value through profit or loss Certain items in the Groups statement of financial position that would otherwise be categorised as loans and receivables under IAS 39 have been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Information relating to the change in fair value of these items as it relates to credit risk is shown in the table below: m At 31 December 2015 At 31 December 2014 Maximum Current Maximum Current exposure financial exposure financial Change in fair value due to change in credit risk to credit risk year Cumulative to credit risk year Cumulative Loans and advances 2,854 3,347 Investments and securities 6,305 3 6,406 1 3 Other financial assets 21 9,159 3 9,774 1 3 The change in fair value due to a change in credit risk shown above is determined as the amount of the change in fair value of the instrument that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk.
For loans and receivables that have been designated as fair value through profit or loss, individual credit spreads are determined at inception as the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the interest rate charged to the client.
Subsequent changes in the benchmark interest rate and the credit spread give rise to changes in fair value of the financial instrument.
Loans and advances are reviewed for observable changes in credit risk and the credit spread is adjusted at subsequent dates if there has been an observable change in credit risk relating to a particular loan or advance.
No credit derivatives are used to hedge the credit risk on any of the financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 206 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2015 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E4: Financial instruments designated as fair value through profit or loss continued Certain items in the Groups statement of financial position, that would otherwise be categorised as financial liabilities at amortised cost under IAS 39, have been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Information relating to the change in fair value of these items as it relates to credit risk is shown in the table below: m At 31 December 2015 At 31 December 2014 Current Contractual Current Contractual Change in fair value due financial maturity financial maturity to change in credit risk Fair value year Cumulative amount Fair value year Cumulative amount Borrowed funds 302 20 74 255 734 10 97 606 Amounts owed to bank depositors 2,885 4 7 2,894 2,199 2 5 2,198 3,187 24 81 3,149 2,933 8 92 2,804 The fair values of other categories of financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss do not change significantly in respect of credit risk.
The change in fair value due to credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss has been determined as the difference between fair values determined using a liability curve adjusted for credit and a risk-free liability curve.
This difference is cross-checked to market-related data on credit spreads, where available.
The basis for not using credit default swaps to determine the change in fair value due to credit risk is the unavailability of reliable market-priced instruments.
E5: Fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities not measured at fair value a Financial instruments Certain financial instruments of the Group are not carried at fair value, principally investments and securities categorised as held to maturity, loans and receivables, and other financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost.
The calculation of the fair value of these financial instruments incorporates the Groups best estimate of the value at which these financial assets could be exchanged, or financial liabilities transferred, between market participants at the measurement date.
The Groups estimate of what fair value is does not necessarily represent what it would be able to sell the asset for, or transfer the respective financial liability for, in an involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.
Investments and securities Investments and securities with a carrying value of 2,264 million 2014: 2,386 million are shown within note E1 as held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables and are therefore not carried at fair value.
The fair value of these securities is estimated to be 2,196 million 2014: 2,390 million and is based either on available market prices Level 1 763 million 2014: 519 million or discounted cash flow analysis where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive Level 2 1,433 million 2014: 1,871 million.
Loans and advances Loans and advances with a carrying value of 26,437 million 2014: 29,835 million, shown within note E1 as loans and receivables and therefore not carried at fair value, principally comprise variable rate financial assets.
The interest rates on these variable rate financial assets are adjusted when the applicable benchmark interest rate changes.
The fair value of these financial instruments at the reporting date are estimated to be 26,271 million 2014: 29,809 million and would be classified as Level 3.
Loans and advances are not actively traded in most markets and it is therefore not possible to determine the fair value of these loans and advances using observable market prices and market inputs.
Due to the unique characteristics of the loans and advances portfolio and the fact that there have been no recent transactions involving the disposals of such loans and advances, there is no basis to determine a price that could be negotiated between market participants in an orderly transaction.
The Group is not currently in the position of a forced sale of such underlying loans and advances and it would therefore be inappropriate to value the loans and advances on a forced-sale basis.
For specifically impaired loans and advances, the carrying value as determined after consideration of the Groups IAS 39 credit impairments, is considered the best estimate of fair value.
The Group has developed a methodology and model to determine the fair value of the gross exposures for the performing loans and advances measured at amortised cost.
This model incorporates the use of average interest rates and projected monthly cash flows per product type.
Future cash flows are discounted using interest rates at which similar loans would be granted to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities.
Inputs into the model include various assumptions utilised in the pricing of loans and advances.
The determination of such inputs is highly subjective and therefore any change to one or more of the assumptions may result in a significant change in the determination of the fair value of loans and advances.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials Other financial assets 207 The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, mandatory deposits with central banks and provisions and trade, other receivables and other assets are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short-term in nature or are repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.
Cash and cash equivalents and mandatory reserves would be classified into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Trade, other receivables and other assets would be classified into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Amounts owed to depositors Amounts owed to depositors principally comprises variable rate liabilities.
The carrying value of the amounts owed to depositors approximates fair value because the instruments reprice to current market rates at frequent intervals.
In addition, a significant portion of the balance is callable or is short-term in nature.
Amounts owed to depositors would be classified into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Borrowed funds Borrowed funds with a carrying value of 2,720 million 2014: 2,310 million are shown within note E1 as financial liabilities at amortised cost and therefore not carried at fair value.
The fair value of these instruments is estimated to be 2,656 million 2014: 2,318 million and is based either on available market prices Level 1 1,636 million 2014: 1,421 million or discounted cash flow analysis where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive Level 2 1,020 million 2014: 897 million.
Other financial liabilities The carrying values of trade, other payables, and other liabilities are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short-term in nature or are repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.
Trade, other payables and other liabilities would be classified into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
b Non-financial instruments The fair value of plant and equipment, investment in associated undertakings and joint ventures that is not categorised as Designated at fair value through profit or loss and Life assurance policyholder liabilities that are not categorised as Designated at fair value through profit or loss approximates the respective carrying values.
All of these assets and liabilities would be classified as Level 3.
E6: Master netting or similar agreements The Group offsets financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position when it has a legally enforceable right to do so and intends to settle on a net basis simultaneously.
Certain master netting agreements do not provide the Group with the current legally enforceable right to offset the instruments.
The majority of these transactions are governed by the principles of ISDA or a similar type of agreements.
These agreements aim to protect the parties in the event of default.
The following tables present information on the potential effect of netting offset arrangements after taking into consideration these types of agreements.
