Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section four Capital structure and financing This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure for the Group, specifically, how much cash is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead ofannouncing results and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to deliver its business plan.
During the year the Group entered into two year secured and unsecured term loans for US$390 million and US$300 million, respectively.
The Group also refinanced its revolving credit facility arrangements with a new five year US$570 million revolving credit facility.
4.1 Finance income and expense Finance income is mainly comprised of interest received from short-term investments in money market funds, external bank deposits and government bonds.
Financing costs mainly arise from interest due on bonds, external bank loans and foreign exchange losses primarily due to the translation of foreign currency borrowings.
Accounting policy detailed in note 5.1.

These costs are treated as exceptional due to the nature of these costs which were necessary as bondholder approval and consents were required as part of the acquisition of Columbus.
2013 14 exceptional finance costs of US$25 million relate to additional interest, early redemption charges and capitalised finance transaction costs written off in respect of the 2017 bond which was redeemed on 28 February 2014.
Tax relief of US$4 million is available on interest capitalised in the year ended 31 March 2015 2013 14 US$1 million.
Interest has been capitalised within property, plant and equipment at a rate of 3.1% 2013 14 3.8% on qualifying capital expenditure.

As at 31 March 2015, the Group had US$421 million undrawn facilities available due to US$149 million letters of credit in favour of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates prevailing when the facilities were arranged.
Annual Report 2014 15 133 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section four Capital structure and financing 4.3 Borrowings continued The agreements for the facilities entered into during the year contain financial and other covenants which are standard to these types of arrangements.

These assets were measured at fair value based on observable market data and are within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy note 4.7.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for available-for-sale financial assets is equal to their carrying value.
4.5 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This relates to the Columbus US$1,250 million senior notes for which the redemption option associated with the notes represent an embedded derivative.

Columbus held senior notes of US$1,250 million at 31 March 2015.
The Group assumed all terms agreed by Columbus under the debt agreement.
These terms enable the Group to redeem the notes under various scenarios.
The redemption terms associated with the notes represent an embedded derivative which required bifurcation where the bifurcated amount is carried at fair value, with charges going through profit or loss.
The embedded derivative is held at fair value and is valued using a valuation technique classed as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.
The lowest level inputs to the valuation are directly or indirectly observable.
Based on the unique features of the notes, the derivative was valued using a binomial tree lattice approach based on the Hull-White single factor interest rate term structure model.
Under this approach, an interest rate lattice is constructed according to a given short rate volatility and mean reversion constant as implied by the market as at each valuation date.
Key inputs to the valuation included: Percentages of swaption volatility selected as at 31 March 2015 between 34% and 74.20% and the credit spread as at 31 March 2015 was implied to be approximately 4.51%.
Annual Report 2014 15 135 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section four Capital structure and financing 4.6 Financial liabilities at fair value In the prior year, a liability was held for the 45% share of Monaco Telecom owned by the Principality of Monaco.
In the event that the Principality decided to exercise their contractual right to sell this stake, we would have been obliged to purchase it from them.
Monaco was sold in May 2014 and this liability was cancelled as part of the sale.

1 Monaco Telecom put option A put option was held by the non-controlling shareholder of Monaco Telecom, the Principality of Monaco the Principality as at 31 March 2014.
The put option was measured at fair value and was calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using inputs that were not based on publicly observable market data.
The liability for the put option represents 45% of the market value of Monaco Telecom.
The key assumptions used in valuing the put option liability were the Monaco Telecom three-year operating plan in particular revenue performance and discount rates of between 8% and 27% for the distinct operating businesses within Monaco Telecom.
A movement in the discount rate of 1% would result in an increase or decrease in the liability of US$33 million.
On 20 May 2014, the Group sold Monaco Telecom.
The put option liability was cancelled as a result of the sale note 2.8.
2 CMC put option As part of the transaction to sell Monaco & Islands to Batelco note 2.8.

Specific shareholder authority for such purchases was obtained at the general meeting held on 5 December 2014: grant a right to the Principal Vendors to nominate one Director each to the Board, subject to recommendation by the Nomination Committee.
The initial three nominations were agreed at completion, being John Risley, Thad York and Brendan Paddick: and restrict the ability of the Principal Vendors to otherwise sell the consideration shares during the period covered by the options.
A lock-up and put option agreement was entered into between the Company and each of the three Principal Vendors for the issued share capital as part of the acquisition of Columbus.

1 Columbus put option and repurchase liability As part of the transaction to acquire Columbus International Inc, the Company issued 1,557,529,605 consideration shares of US5 cents each to the Principal Vendors in proportion to their Columbus shareholding.
As a result, the Principal Vendors CVBI Holdings Barbados Inc, Clearwater Holdings Barbados Limited, Columbus Holding LLC and Brendan Paddick in aggregate hold approximately 36% of the ordinary shares in the Company.
Each Principal Vendor agreed at completion to enter into lock-up and put option arrangements in respect of its issued consideration shares until 2019.
An exception to the lock-up arrangements will enable each Principal Vendor to require the Company to purchase for cash up to a certain number of its shares each year from 2016 to 2019 inclusive for the notional issue price of US$0.7349 per share.
If a Principal Vendor sells some or all of their shareholding subject to orderly market conditions then some or all of its future options to require the Company to purchase up to a certain number of shares as described above will immediately cease to have effect and will not be capable of exercise.
The liability for the repurchase under the terms of IAS 32 have been valued on initial recognition using the present value technique of the future liability was US$879 million 2014 15 US$nil.
4.9 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests We made no business acquisitions with non-controlling interests during the year, however, accounting standards note 5.1.
3 require us to make an adjustment to goodwill attributable to Monaco Telecom.
On 20 May 2014 we sold Monaco Telecom note 2.8.
Accounting policy detailed in note 1.2.
1 Monaco Telecom Goodwill in connection with the Groups investment in Monaco Telecom SAM increased by US$46 million during the year ended 31 March 2014.
The goodwill balance increased as a result of exchange differences and changes in the fair value of the Monaco Telecom put option.
As part of the acquisition of Monaco Telecom a put option was issued note 4.6.
Changes in the fair value of this put option are treated as contingent consideration and adjusted against goodwill.
The cash outflow in respect of contingent consideration, being the dividend paid to the Principality as the non-controlling shareholder of Monaco Telecom, was US$30 million for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Monaco Telecom was sold on 20 May 2014.
The put option was cancelled subsequent to the sale.

Capital management The Group defines capital as equity, borrowings note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents note 4.2.
The Group does not have any externally imposed requirements for managing capital, other than those imposed by Company Law.
Annual Report 2014 15 139 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section four Capital structure and financing 4.10 Equity continued The Boards objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives, including, but not limited to, reshaping the portfolio through mergers and acquisitions.
In doing so the Board seeks to: Manage funding and liquidity risk: Optimise shareholder return: and Maintain credit ratings.
This strategy is unchanged from the prior year.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with the policies described in note 4.11.
The Articles of Association of the Company permit aggregate borrowing up to the higher of three times the adjusted capital and reserves of the Group or US$3 billion.
The Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders and it intends to target a sustainable and progressive dividend that reflects the underlying cash generation and growth outlook of the business.
This process is managed through the Groups budget and longer-term forecasting process.
In May 2014, the Group received total cash proceeds of US$445 million for the Monaco Telecom disposal note 2.8.
In addition, the Group received US$8.6 million relating to the estimated cash, debt and working capital at completion.
In line with the Boards objectives, these proceeds were used towards the acquisition of Columbus note 3.11.1.
In April 2013, the Group received total cash proceeds of US$501 million in respect of the Islands sub-group disposal note 2.8.
2, excluding the Seychelles for which regulatory approval was not obtained, representing consideration of US$470 million plus US$31 million of the proportionate share of net cash in the disposed businesses attributable to Cable & Wireless Communications.

Foreign currency translation and hedging reserve The foreign currency translation and hedging reserve contains exchange differences on the translation of subsidiaries with a functional currency different to the presentation currency of the Group.
It also includes cumulative exchange differences arising on the translation of hedging instruments.
Capital and other reserves At 31 March 2015, other reserves included a capital redemption reserve of US$152 million 2013 14 US$152 million, a revaluation reserve of US$nil 2013 14 US$nil, a fair value reserve of US$20 million 2013 14 US$17 million, a special reserve of US$2,137 million 2013 14 US$2,137 million and a capital reserve of US$987 million 2013 14 US$987 million, less a reserve relating to transactions with non-controlling interests of US$5 million 2013 14 US$5 million and a reserve for the repurchase of shares and put option of US$776 million 2013 14 US$nil.
A merger reserve is a statutory relief from recognising share premium when issuing equity shares in order to acquire the legal entity shares of another company where specified conditions are met.
The merger reserve was formed at 31 March 2015 as the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Columbus and the consideration for Columbus included the issuance of shares.
The put option reserve was also formed at 31 March 2015 with the acquisition of Columbus note 4.8.
The special reserve relates to the cancellation of the share premium account of Cable & Wireless Limited formerly Cable and Wireless Plc in February 2004.
It will reduce from time to time by the amount of any increase in the paid-up share capital and share premium account of Cable & Wireless Limited after 20 February 2004 resulting from the issue of new shares for cash or other new consideration or upon a capitalisation of distributable reserves.
On 26 March 2010, a court-approved capital reduction became effective which had the effect of creating a capital reserve of US$1,931 million which may be released, in whole or in part, to distributable reserves of the Company at the discretion and upon the resolution of the Board of Directors or a duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors.
140 Cable & Wireless Communications 4.11 Financial risk management This note details our treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies.
We discuss the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risk and the policies in place to monitor and manage these risks.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board for managing each of these risks including levels of authority on the type and use of financial instruments.
Treasury policy The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk : credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Day to day management of treasury activities is delegated to the Groups treasury function Treasury, within specified financial limits for each type of transaction and counterparty.
To the extent that subsidiaries undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by Group policies and delegated authorities.
Material subsidiary positions are monitored by Treasury.
Where appropriate, transactions are reported to the Board.
All subsidiaries are required to report details of their cash and debt positions to Treasury on a monthly basis.
The key responsibilities of Treasury include funding, investment of surplus cash and the management of interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The majority of the Groups cash resources including facilities and borrowings are managed centrally by Treasury.
From time to time, the Group may use derivatives including forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and options, where appropriate, in the management of its foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
The use of these instruments is in accordance with strategies agreed from time to time by Treasury and subject to policies approved by the Board.
Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes and derivative transactions and positions are monitored and reported by Treasury on a regular basis and are subject to policies adopted by the Board.
Exchange rate risk The Group trades in many countries and a proportion of its revenue is generated in currencies other than US dollars.
The Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to non-dollar currency payments including external dividends, the corporate centre costs and pensions, dividend income from foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries and the net asset carrying value of non-US dollar investments.
Exchange risk is managed centrally by the corporate centre on a matching cash flow basis including forecast foreign currency cash repatriation inflows from subsidiaries and forecast foreign currency payments.
1 for key exchange rates used.
Where appropriate, the Group manages its exposure to movements in exchange rates on a net basis and from time to time may use forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative and financial instruments to reduce the exposures created where currencies do not naturally offset in the short term.
The Group will undertake hedges to minimise the exposure to individual transactions that create significant foreign exchange exposures for the Group where appropriate.
Where cost-effective and possible, foreign subsidiaries are financed in their domestic currency to minimise the impact of translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
As part of the overall policy of managing the exposure arising from foreign exchange movements relating to the net carrying value of overseas investments, the Group may, from time to time, elect to match certain foreign currency liabilities against the carrying value of foreign investments.
The reported profits of the Group are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
Overseas earnings are predominately in US dollars or currencies linked to the US dollar.
However, the Group also has overseas earnings in other currencies.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in relation to monetary assets and liabilities that are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
In broad terms, based on monetary assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2015 the impact of a unilateral 10% weakening of the US dollar would have been to decrease profit from continuing operations by approximately US$34 million at 31 March 2014 US$42 million.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on its surplus cash balances and variable rate loans although there is a degree of offset between the two.
Treasury may seek to reduce volatility by fixing a proportion of this interest rate exposure while taking account of prevailing market conditions as appropriate.
At 31 March 2015, 69% 31 March 2014 79% of the Groups loans were at a fixed rate.
A reduction in interest rates would have an unfavourable impact upon the fair value of the Groups fixed rate loans.
However, no debt is held for trading purposes and it is intended that it will be kept in place until maturity.
As a result, there is no exposure to fair value loss on fixed rate borrowings and, as such, its effect has not been modelled.
A one percentage point increase in interest rates will have a US$4 million 2013 14 US$2 million impact on the income received from the surplus cash balances of the Group and a US$ 9 million 2013 14 US$2 million impact on the floating rate loans of the Group.
The impact on equity is limited to the impact on profit or loss.
