STRATEGIC REPORT Reconciliation of consolidated statement of financial position continued Notes: 1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of financial position aggregates the line items into the single line item Investment in investment entities.
In the Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as if the investment entity subsidiaries were consolidated.
The adjustment reclassifies items in the Statement of financial position.
There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different.
The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is significantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by investment entity subsidiaries is aggregated into the Investments in investment entities line.
We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments, unquoted equity investments or loans and receivables.
Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates these items.
2 Cash balances held in investment entity subsidiaries are also aggregated into the Investment in investment entities line.
At 31 March 2015 3 million 2014 restated: 23 million of cash was held in subsidiaries that are now classified as investment entity subsidiaries and is therefore included in the Investment in investment entities line.
3 Intercompany balances between investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the IFRS basis.
If an investment entity subsidiary has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset or liability of the investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary will be disclosed as an asset or liability in the Statement of financial position for the Group.
Prior to the adoption of IFRS 10, these balances would have been eliminated on consolidation.
4 Investment basis financial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under this basis.

Therefore in our Investment basis financial statements, we have disclosed our cash flow statement on a look through basis, in order to reflect the underlying sources and uses of cash flows and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2 There is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis financial statements and the IFRS financial statements because there are cash balances held in investment entity subsidiary vehicles.
Cash held within investment entity subsidiaries will not be shown in the IFRS statements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.
