Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Note 9 Earnings losses per share and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings losses per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year.
Diluted earnings losses per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options.
The dilutive effect is calculated on the full exercise of all potentially dilutive ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
Given the loss for the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2015, the Group has recognised a basic loss per share rather than a basic earnings per share.
The dilutive effects have not been considered in calculating the diluted loss per share as this would reduce the loss per share.
For the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2015 there were 12 million potentially dilutive share options.
As the Group has recognised an underlying profit the dilutive effects have been considered in calculating the underlying earnings per share.

The effective rate of tax on underlying earnings was 20.7% 2014: 15.4% which excludes certain permanent differences on which tax relief is not available.
Under IAS 33 Earnings per share, potentially dilutive share options are treated as dilutive only when their conversion would decrease earnings per share.
All adjustments above have been based on 8,107 million 2014: 8,078 million shares, with the 0.02 pence per share dilutive impact of the 12 million current year potentially dilutive share options factored in only when calculating the final underlying diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.
