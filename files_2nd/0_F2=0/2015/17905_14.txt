This led to materially increased costs associated with overtime payments, customer Key Facts concessions and penalties and higher engine lease costs, against a backdrop ofcompetitive Authorisations supporting Authorisations supporting over Strong customer relationships and low growth markets.

After initial weather driven delays, construction of the new engine repair and test facility at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport is now progressing well and remains on track to meet the revised fully operational date of the end of 2016.
In addition, the new rotorcraft engine repair facility in Abu Dhabi successfully established its test cell, as well as receiving both General Civil Aviation Authority CAR 145 approval and EASA certification ensuring that it can meet the comprehensive MRO needs for PW200 and PT6C-67 customers throughout the EMEA region.
