PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT The Company made a profit before dividends paid for the financial profit of 6.6m 52 week period to 28 March 2014: 21.2m.

INVESTMENTS m Shares in Group undertaking Cost As at 28 March 2014 295.4 Additions share based payments 1.4 Distribution in-specie a 280.3 At 3 April 2015 16.5 a During the year the Company received a dividend in-specie, being a receivable due from another group company, which is not expected to be settled in the near future.
As a result the value of the Companys investment in the IreCo 1 company wound up during the year fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Companys accounting records.
Schedule 1 to the Companies Act 2006, The Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 SI 2008 No.
410 requires that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the Companys profit and loss account.
However, the Directors consider that, as there has been no overall loss to the Company, it would fail to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Companys profit and loss account for the year and the cost of the investment of 280.3m should instead be re-allocated to the carrying amount of the Companys receivable, so as to recognise in the Companys individual balance sheet the effective cost to the company of the receivable.
Given that the receivable has a fair value of 328.3m, the company has recognised an unrealised gain of 48.0m through the Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL.
The effect of this departure is to increase the holding companys total recognised gains for the financial year and the carrying amount of the receivable in the holding companys balance sheet by 280.3m.
The Group financial statements are not affected by this transfer.
During FY14 the Group began an exercise in order to restructure the underlying companies of the Group.
During the year this exercise led to a distribution in-specie of discounted loan notes from Halfords Ireco 1 Limited to Halfords Group plc.
