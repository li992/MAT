Disclosure Service Concession Arrangements The Consolidated Group held at 31 March 2015 investments in 101 2014: 93 service concession arrangements in the Accommodation, Education, Health, Transport and Law and Order sectors.
The concessions vary on the required obligations but typically require the financing and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specific project agreement.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operators rights to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the service company to fulfil its requirements.
