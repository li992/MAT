These studies are undertaken to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to explore the preliminary or potential Safety profile efficacy of the product candidate, as well as dosage tolerance and The known information about how safe a medicine is the optimal effective dose Seasonal allergy Phase IIb An allergy where symptoms are only experienced at certain times of Phase II studies are sometimes further divided into two phases: phase the year IIa trials are designed to assess dosage how much product candidate subjects should be given : and phase IIb trials are specifically designed Short ragweed to study efficacy how well the product candidate works at a prescribed Ambrosia artemisiifolia, a type of flowering plant common in dose.
Often phase II trials are designed as randomised clinical studies, North America where some subjects receive the product candidate and others receive a placebo standard treatment.
Randomised phase II trials typically have Synthetic peptide immuno-regulatory epitopes SPIREs fewer subjects than randomised phase III trials Short amino acid sequences that contain the T-cell epitope, and intended to elicit a T-reg response to an allergen identified using the Phase III Companys ToleroMune technology When phase II trials demonstrate that a specific dosage range of the product candidate is likely to be effective and has an acceptable safety T-cell epitope profile, confirmatory phase III trials are undertaken.
These studies are Epitope that is recognised by a T-cell intended to provide an adequate basis for establishing the benefit risk ratio for a subsequent application for marketing approval.
Therefore, TH2 response a sufficiently high number of subjects must be enrolled and exposed The defensive response of the immune system response to an allergen, to the product candidate for a duration which will provide adequate triggered by TH2 cells efficacy and safety data for the envisaged clinical use.
The studies must be controlled, i. e. compare the product candidate to placebo and T-Helper cells class 2 TH2 cells or to active treatment depending on the medical condition and the A sub-group of lymphocytes a type of white blood cell product candidate under investigation.
