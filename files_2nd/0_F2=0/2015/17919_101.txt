11 Financial risk management 11.1 Financial risk factors The companys activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk and cash ow interest rate risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
The companys overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the companys financial performance.

Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Chief Financial Officer identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposure on its foreign currency denominated investments in related undertakings, primarily with respect to the Euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.

Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 205 11.1 Financial risk factors continued ii Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk The companys interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at oating rates.
The companys interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings, including inter-company borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the company to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Company policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at xed rate using cross-currency interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2015 and 2014, the companys borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of xed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account  rate swaps: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 87.7 In more than one year, but not more than two years 83.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 178.3 172.4 In more than five years 190.4 64.3 456.4 319.7 Floating interest rate borrowings 40.1 143.3 Total external borrowings 496.5 463.0 Floating interest rate inter-company borrowings 64.7 69.0 During 2015 and 2014, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31 December 2015 As at 31 December 2014 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 56.0 56.0 1.6 1.6 Bank overdrafts 105.9 105.9 Inter-company receivables 64.9 60.3 125.2 158.2 64.9 223.1 Inter-company payables 64.7 64.7 69.0 69.0 Borrowings 456.4 40.1 496.5 319.7 143.3 463.0 Pre-derivative net debt position 391.5 11.5 380.0 161.5 251.7 413.2 Derivative effect note i 55.8 55.8 22.2 22.2 Post-derivative net debt position 335.7 11.5 324.2 139.3 251.7 391.0 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The majority of banks and financial institutions are independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2015 206 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued 11.1 Financial risk factors continued Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The total counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 124.1 million 2014: 63.4 million.
The company does not hold any collateral as security.
c Liquidity risk Cash ow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and is aggregated by group finance.
Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the companys liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities note 9 at all times so that the company does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the companys debt nancing plans, covenant compliance, and compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets.
The table below analyses the companys financial liabilities, excluding break clauses, which will be settled on a net basis into relative maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contract maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash ows using spot interest and foreign exchange rates at 31 December 2015.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of the discount is not significant.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets of the company.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: a financial derivatives in fair value hedging relationship will not inuence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: a the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net oating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: a the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: and a changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.
The following table shows the companys exposure to foreign exchange risk as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, which is a result of increase decrease of 10% movement in foreign exchange gains losses on translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The company manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
The company continues to remain compliant with all its banking covenants.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the balance sheet plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.

The different levels have been dened as follows: a Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : a Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 2 : and a Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3.

The valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specic estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Specic techniques used to value financial instruments include: a quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments: a the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on observable yield curves: a the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value: and a other techniques, such as discounted cash ow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
