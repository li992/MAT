Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 129 Measurement of Prepaid Operational Readiness Costs Included within prepayments are operational readiness costs relating to the new administration service agreement which are initially recognised at the amounts advanced.
The prepayment is expensed in line with the provision of services under the service agreement.
At each statement of financial position date, the value of the prepayment is assessed for impairment recognised against the present value of the estimated future contract benefits.
In determining the present value of the estimated future contract benefits, the critical judgements are the levels of future business that will be serviced, the anticipated future service tariffs, termination fees payable and receivable under the contract and the rate used to discount amounts to present value.
Fair Value Estimation of Assets Acquired In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, as of the acquisition date, the Group recognises, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and classifies the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of the contractual terms, economic conditions, its operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as they exist at the acquisition date.
The Group measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values.
SEGMENT REPORTING IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified, on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board, in order to allocate resources to each segment and assess its performance.
The Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: 1.
Life business offering pensions, protection and investment products through the Groups life assurance subsidiaries.
Unit Trust business offering unit trust investment products, including ISAs, through St. Jamess Place Unit Trust Group Limited and St. Jamess Place Investment Administration Limited.
Distribution business the distribution network for the St. Jamess Place life and unit trust products as well as financial products such as annuities, mortgages and stakeholder pensions, from third party providers.
The figures for segment income provided to the Board in respect of the distribution business relate to the distribution of the products of third party providers only.
The figures for segment profit provided to the Board take account of fees and commissions payable by the life business and unit trust business to the distribution business.
Other all other Group activities.
Separate geographical segmental information is not presented since the Group does not segment its business geographically.
Most of its customers are based in the UK, as is management of the assets.
In particular, the operation based in south east Asia is not yet material for separate consideration.
The income, profit and assets of these segments are set out over the next few pages.
