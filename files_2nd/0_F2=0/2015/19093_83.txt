It also operates two post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans of 12 million 2014: 7 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined contribution plans during 2016 are 12 million 2015: 7 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans The Group operates in excess of 100 retirement plans across its global operations.
A large proportion of the Groups defined benefit plans are closed to new members.
The majority of these plans are unfunded and provide pensions and severance benefits to members of those plans.
The most significant unfunded defined benefit plans are operated in Austria, Germany and Russia and funded plans are operated primarily in the UK.
These plans are established in accordance with applicable local labour legislation and or collective agreements with participating employees.
The benefits are based on a variety of factors, the most significant of which are a combination of pensionable service and final salary.
A number of these plans also provide additional benefits in the event of death in service, disability or ill-health retirement which are derived from the final salary benefit formula.
The assets of the funded plans are held separately in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice where those funds are operated.
The boards of trustees of these plans are required to act in the best interest of the plans and all relevant stakeholders of the plans active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the plans.
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 171 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 22 Retirement benefits continued The post-retirement medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain of their dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The South African plan is unfunded while the Austrian plan is funded.
The South African plan has been closed to new participants since 1January1999.
Except for the actuarial risks set out below, the Group has not identified any additional specific risks in respect of these plans.
Defined benefit plans typically expose the Group to the following actuarial risks: Investment risk Asset volatility The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high-quality bond yields.
If the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit that needs to be funded guaranteed by the employer.
Currently the plan assets have a relatively balanced investment in equity and bonds.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the boards of trustees consider it appropriate that areasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equities.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase plan liabilities, however this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans debt instruments.
Longevity risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
Anincrease in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Salary risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the expected future salaries of plan participants.
An increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Medical cost inflation risk The present value of the post-retirement medical plans is calculated by reference to expected future medical costs.
An increase in medical cost inflation will increase the plan liabilities.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every year using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial assumptions The weighted average principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are detailed below: 2015 2014 % South Africa Europe Other regions South Africa Europe Other regions Discount rate 10.2 2.7 9.4 8.3 2.3 5.9 Rate of inflation 8.2 2.3 5.8 6.5 2.3 5.2 Rate of increase in salaries 9.2 2.0 6.1 7.5 2.8 6.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.6 3.6 1.9 2.1 Expected average increase of medical costs 9.7 4.0 8.0 4.1 The assumption for the discount rate for plan liabilities is based on AA corporate bonds, which are of a suitable duration and currency.
In South Africa, the discount rate assumption has been based on the zero coupon government bond yield curve.
Mortality assumptions The assumed life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are: 2015 2014 years South Africa Europe Other regions South Africa Europe Other regions Retiring today Males 16.04 14.16-22.80 14.29 15.99 13.98-22.70 13.93 Females 19.97 17.63-27.02 17.91 19.93 17.35-26.89 17.72 Retiring in 20 years Males 20.54 13.51-25.00 14.29 20.44 13.98-23.00 13.93 Females 24.79 13.51-26.51 17.91 24.74 14.00-26.00 17.72 The mortality assumptions have been based on published mortality tables in the relevant jurisdictions.

It is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans during 2016 are 17 million 2015: 18 million.
The market values of the plan assets in these plans are detailed below: 2015 2014 million Quoted Unquoted Total Quoted Unquoted Total External equity 41 41 39 39 Property 1 1 Bonds 79 79 77 77 Insurance contracts 15 15 23 23 Cash 1 1 2 2 Fair value of plan assets 122 15 137 118 23 141 The majority of the Groups plan assets are located in Austria and the UK and the following asset-liability matching investing strategies are applied: Austria The investment strategy is based on Austrian Social Security Law which stipulates that investments can only be made in high-quality euro bonds or deposits in euro in highly rated financial institutions.
No investments in equity or equity funds are allowed.
Due to legal and market restrictions asset-liability matching is not possible.
UK The trustees invest in diverse portfolios of pooled funds.
The long-term objective is to ensure that each plan can continue to meet the benefit payments without exposing either the plan or the company to an undue level of risk.
The mix of investments in each plan is determined taking into account the maturity, currency and nature of the expected benefit payments required.
There are no financial instruments or property owned by the Group included in the fair value of plan assets.
The fair values of equity, property, bonds, insurance contracts and cash are determined based on quoted prices in active markets.
The actual return on plan assets in respect of defined benefit plans was a gain of 3 million 2014: gain of 16 million.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 83% 2014: 75% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the plans trustees and in accordance with local independent actuarial advice and statutory provisions.
Sensitivity analyses The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes to the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of the actual changes in the net retirement benefits asset liability as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another and some of the assumptions may be inter-related.
The projected unit credit method was used to calculate the sensitivity analyses below.
