The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years.
The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.
The Company operates one of these schemes, being the Scottish Hydro-Electric scheme.
The Group also has an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit scheme and a Group Personal Pension Plan.
The Group Personal Pension Plan operates on a money purchase basis and has been arranged with Friends Provident.
The Group matches employee contributions up to a specified limit, in most circumstances this is set at 6%.
The Group may also provide additional contributions of 3% after five years and a further 3% after ten years continuous Group service.

The most financially significant risks are likely to be: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets under perform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by and increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so an increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication of the impact on the value of the schemes liabilities of the risks highlighted.
Policy for recognising gains and losses The Group and Company recognise actuarial gains and losses immediately in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income following the re-measurement of the net defined benefit liabilities of the schemes.
Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses The sensitivities disclosed are calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the schemes liabilities.
While these have been calculated consistently with the previous financial year, the method applied may change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.
