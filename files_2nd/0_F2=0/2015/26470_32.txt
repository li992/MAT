Group cash flow does not include cash and cash equivalents held by the Groups Post Trade operations on behalf of its clearing members for use in its operation as manager of the clearing and guarantee system.
These balances represent margins and default funds held for counterparties for short periods in connection with this operation.
Interest on CCP balances are received net of withholding tax, which is deducted at source.
This withholding tax is effectively a cash outflow for the Group, and is shown separately in the cash flow statement.
