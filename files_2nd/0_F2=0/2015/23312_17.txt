Principal Accounting Policies Accounting policies describe the Companys approach to recognising and measuring transactions during the year and the position of the Company at the year end.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied during the year and the preceding year, unless otherwise stated.
a Basis of preparation Accounting Standards Applied The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
The financial statements are also prepared on a going concern basis.
b Foreign Currency and Segmental Reporting i Functional and presentational currency The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency and the currency in which the Companys share capital and expenses, as well as its assets and liabilities, are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currency, whether of a revenue or capital nature, are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any gains or losses, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital reserve or to the revenue account, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
iii Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business of investing in equity and debt securities, issued by companies quoted mainly on the UK or other recognised stock exchanges.
c Financial Instruments i Recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company will offset financial assets and financial liabilities if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis.
ii Derecognition of financial assets The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in the transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as an asset.
iii Derecognition of financial liabilities The Company derecognises financial liabilities when its obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
iv Trade date accounting Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.
16310 Edinburgh pp37 56 does not close 16310 Edinburgh pp37 56 20 05 2015 13:29 Page 41 THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 41 v Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The Companys investments are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, with transaction costs expensed in the income statement, and are subsequently valued at fair value.
Fair value for investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted bid prices at the balance sheet date.
Fair value for investments that are actively traded but where active stock exchange quoted bid prices are not available is determined by reference to a variety of valuation techniques including broker quotes and price modelling.
Unquoted, unlisted or illiquid investments are valued by the Directors at fair value using a variety of valuation techniques including earnings multiples, recent transactions and other market indicators, cash flows and net assets.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
d Hedging and Derivatives Forward currency contracts entered into for hedging purposes are valued at the appropriate forward exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits or losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are recognised in the income statement and taken to capital reserves.
Futures contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes and are valued at the quoted price of the contract.
Profits and losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are recognised in the income statement and taken to capital reserves.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Derivative instruments may be capital or revenue in nature and, accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognised in capital or revenue in the income statement as appropriate.
e Income Interest income arising from fixed income securities and cash is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Dividend income arises from equity investments held and is recognised on the date investments are marked ex-dividend.
Deposit interest and underwriting commission receivable are taken into account on an accruals basis.
f Expenses and Finance Costs Expenses are recognised on an accruals basis and finance costs are recognised using the effective interest method in the income statement.
The investment management fee and finance costs are allocated 70% to capital and 30% to revenue.
This is in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the portfolio.
The performance fee for the year ended 31 March 2014 was allocated wholly to capital as it arose principally from capital returns on the portfolio.
Transaction costs are recognised as capital in the income statement.
All other expenses are allocated to revenue in the income statement.
g Taxation The liability to corporation tax is based on net revenue for the year, excluding non-taxable dividends.
The tax charge is allocated between the revenue and capital account on the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income in the revenue account.

Principal Accounting Policies continued g Taxation continued Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised in respect of surplus management expenses, losses on loan relationships and eligible unrelieved foreign tax to the extent that the Company is likely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these.
h Dividends Payable Dividends are not recognised in the accounts unless there is an obligation to pay at the balance sheet date.
Proposed dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid to shareholders.
Income This note shows the income generated from the portfolio investment assets of the Company and income received from any other source.

Included within other expenses is 17,000 2014: 16,000 of employers National Insurance payable on Directors fees.
As at 31 March 2015, the amount outstanding on Directors fees and employers National Insurance was 16,800 2014: 16,900.
Fees payable to the Companys auditor for audit related assurance services are for their review in connection with the half-yearly financial statements and the annual certificate to the trustee of the debenture stock, which are recognised in revenue.
Fees payable to the Companys auditor are shown excluding VAT, which is included in other expenses.
Finance Costs Finance costs arise on any borrowing facilities the Company has in place, being in this case a 100 million of debenture stock and a 100 million bank revolving credit facility.

Taxation As an investment trust the Company pays no tax on capital gains.
As the Company invests principally in UK equities, it has little overseas tax and the overseas tax charge is the result of withholding tax deducted at source.
This note also clarifies the basis for the Company to have no deferred tax asset or liability.

d Factors that may affect future tax changes The Company has surplus management expenses and losses on loan relationships of 408,385,000 2014: 389,865,000 that are available to offset future taxable revenue.
A deferred tax asset of 81,667,000 2014: 77,973,000, measured at the standard corporation tax rate of 20% 2014: 20%, has not been recognised in respect of these expenses since the Directors believe that there will be no taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax assets can be offset.
Return per Ordinary Share Return per share is the amount of gain generated for the financial year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
The basic, capital and total returns per ordinary share are based on each return on ordinary shares after tax and on 195,116,734 2014: 195,116,734 ordinary shares, being the number of shares in issue during the year.

Dividends Dividends represent the distribution of income to shareholders.
The Company pays four dividends a year three interim and one final dividend.
Investments The portfolio comprises investments which are listed or traded on a recognised stock exchange, and a small proportion of investments which are valued by the Directors as they are unlisted or not regularly traded.
Gains and losses in the year are either: realised, usually arising when investments sold: or unrealised, being the difference from cost on those investments still held at the year end.

Share Capital Share capital represents the total number of shares in issue, on which dividends accrue.
Reserves This note explains the different reserves attributable to shareholders.
The aggregate of the reserves and share capital see previous note make up total shareholders funds.
The share premium comprises the net proceeds received by the Company following the issue of shares, after deduction of the nominal amount of 25 pence and any applicable issue costs.
The capital redemption reserve maintains the equity share capital arising from any buy back and cancellation of shares: both are non-distributable.
Capital investment gains and losses are shown in note 9 b, and form part of the capital reserve.
The revenue reserve shows the net revenue retained after payment of any dividends.
The capital and revenue reserves are distributable by way of dividend.

Net Asset Value NAV per Ordinary Share The Companys total net assets total assets less total liabilities are often termed shareholders funds and are converted into NAV per ordinary share by dividing by the number of shares in issue.
The NAV debt at par is the NAV with the value of the 100 million debenture the debt at its nominal equivalent to the par value of 100 million.
The NAV debt at market value reflects the debenture stock at the value that a third party would be prepared to pay for the debt, and this amount fluctuates owing to various factors including changes in interest rates and the remaining life of the debt.
The number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end was 195,116,734 2014: 195,116,734. a NAV debt at par The shareholders funds in the balance sheet are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards: however, this does not reflect the rights of shareholders on a return of assets under the Articles of Association.
These rights are reflected in the net assets with debt at par and the corresponding NAV per share.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments Financial instruments comprise the Companys investment portfolio, derivative financial instruments held if any, as well as any cash, borrowings, other receivables and other payables.
Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments mainly comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages 15 and 16 a debenture, a bank loan as well as its cash, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main financial risks that the Company faces from its financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities and management of gearing of the Company as more fully described in the Directors Report.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term so as to fulfil its investment policy incorporating the Companys investment objective.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These policies are summarised below and have remained substantially unchanged for the two years under review.
Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk for the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board has meetings in each calendar quarter to assess risk and review investment performance, as disclosed in the Board Responsibilities on page 23.
Any borrowing to gear the investment portfolio is used to enhance returns but also increases the Companys exposure to market 1 risk and volatility.
Up until the maturity of the 100 million 11 2% debenture on 30 June 2014, the Company had structural gearing of 200 million.
Subsequently, the Company has the ability to gear by using its 100 million debenture stock 2022 and its bank facility of 100 million.
Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and all of its liabilities are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to US dollar and Swiss franc.
16310 Edinburgh pp37 56 does not close 16310 Edinburgh pp37 56 20 05 2015 13:29 Page 51 THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 51 Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to foreign currencies arising naturally from the Managers choice of securities.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the assets denominated in currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
The Company may invest up to 20% of the portfolio in securities listed on non-UK stock exchanges.
At the year end holdings of non-UK securities total 212.0 million 2014: 235.7 million representing 14.0% 2014: 16.6% of the portfolio.
Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2015 2014 EURO USD CHF EURO USD CHF 000 000 000 000 000 000 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 1,905 1,253 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 120,832 91,179 29,537 98,270 107,904 Total net foreign currency exposure 122,737 92,432 29,537 98,270 107,904 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity In respect of the Companys direct foreign currency exposure to investments denominated in currencies, if sterling had weakened by 4.5% for the US dollar and 3.3% for the Swiss franc during the year, the income statement capital return and net assets of the Company would have increased by 8.4 million 2014: 5.3 million.
Conversely, if sterling had strengthened by the same percentage for the currencies mentioned above, the capital return and net assets of the Company would have decreased by the same amount.
The exchange rate variances of 4.5% for US dollar and 3.3% for Swiss francs 2014: US dollar 3.4%, Swiss franc 1.3% and Euro 1.5% have been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the relevant currency.
This sensitivity takes no account of any impact on the market values of the Companys investments arising from the foreign currency mix of their respective revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements will affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and money market funds, and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate determined by the custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon.
The Company put in place a 364 day committed revolving credit facility the facility of 100 million with the custodian on 24 June 2014.
Interest is payable at 0.70% over LIBOR with a commitment fee for undrawn amounts.
Under the facilitys covenants, the Companys total indebtedness must not exceed 25% of total assets and total assets must not be less than 500 million.
The facility is due for renewal on 23 June 2015.
The Company uses the facility when required at levels monitored by the Board.
At the maximum possible facility gearing of 100 million, the effect of a 1% increase decrease in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the Company's income of 1,000,000.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued Risk Management Policies and Procedures continued The Company has an uncommitted bank overdraft facility which it uses for settlement purposes and interest is dependent on the base rate determined by the Custodian.
All of the Companys debt of 100 million 2014: 200 million of debenture stock is fixed which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
Details of the debenture stock interest is shown in note 12, with details of its market value and the affect on net asset value in note 15 b.
The Company can invest in fixed income securities although at the year end none were held 2014: nil.
Interest rate exposure At 31 March the exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when the interest rate is due to be reset: and fixed interest rates giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and need not be highly correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the profit after tax for the year and the net assets of the Company would decrease by 151 million 2014: 142 million.
Conversely, if the value of the portfolio rose by 10%, the profit after tax and the net assets of the Company would increase by the same amounts.
Liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the Companys investments constitute a diversified portfolio of readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
In addition, the Company has an overdraft facility which it can use to provide short-term funding flexibility.
Liquidity risk exposure The contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, are as follows: 2015 MORE THAN THREE MONTHS THREE MONTHS BUT LESS THAN MORE THAN OR LESS ONE YEAR ONE YEAR TOTAL 000 000 000 000 Bank overdraft 230 230 Debenture stock 100,000 100,000 Bank facility 50,000 50,000 Interest on debenture stock 7,750 50,375 58,125 Accruals 861 861 51,091 7,750 150,375 209,216 2014 MORE THAN THREE MONTHS THREE MONTHS BUT LESS THAN MORE THAN OR LESS ONE YEAR ONE YEAR TOTAL 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 100,000 100,000 200,000 Interest on debenture stocks 5,750 7,750 58,125 71,625 Amounts due to brokers 3,596 3,596 Accruals 810 810 Performance fee 4,826 4,826 114,982 7,750 158,125 280,857 Credit risk encompasses the failure by counterparties to deliver securities which the Company has paid for, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered, and cash balances.
Counterparty risk is minimised by using only approved counterparties.
The Companys ability to operate in the short-term may be adversely affected if the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
The Board reviews the custodians annual controls report and the Managers management of the relationship with the custodian.
Cash balances are limited to a maximum of 5 million with any one depository, with only approved depositories being used, and a maximum deposit of 75 million with Short-Term Investments Company Global Series plc, a triple-A rated money market fund.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, amounts due to brokers, accruals, cash and any drawings on the bank facility or at amortised cost debentures.
The book cost and fair value of the debenture, based on the offer value at the balance sheet date, are as follows: BOOK FAIR BOOK FAIR VALUE VALUE VALUE VALUE 2015 2015 2014 2014 NUMBER 000 NUMBER 000 Debenture repayable between within one year: 1 11 2% Debenture Stock 2014 100,000 103,231 Debenture repayable in more than five years: 3 7 4% Debenture Stock 2022 100,000 135,439 100,000 125,892 Discount on issue of debenture 1,883 2,134 98,117 135,439 197,866 229,123 Incorporating the fair value of the debentures results in the reduction of the net asset value per ordinary share to 686.07p 2014: 613.25p.
Fair Value of Hierarchy Disclosures All except three of the Companys portfolio of investments are in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The three levels set out in FRS 29 follow.
Level 1 fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 fair values based on valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 fair values based on valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
The sole investment in Level 2 comprised the Companys holding of Barclays Bank Nuclear Power Notes 28 February 2019.
The two investments in Level 3 arose previously as a result of corporate events on securities already held: Eurovestech delisted from AIM and Proximagen CVRs arose as a partial cash alternative on the original Proximagen equity holding.
The holdings in these two securities did not change during the year.

The Companys total capital employed is managed to achieve the Companys objective and investment policy as set out on page 7, including that borrowings may be used to provide gearing of the equity portfolio up to the maximum authorised by shareholders, currently 25% of net assets.
Net gearing was 10.9% 2014: 15.7% at the balance sheet date.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital were unchanged throughout the year and the preceding year.
The main risks to the Companys investments are shown in the Strategic Report under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 9 to 12.
These also explain that the Company is able to use borrowings to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio.
The Board can manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy-back shares and it also determines dividend payments.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility by the terms imposed by the custodian.
The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements.
This is unchanged from the prior year.
Borrowings comprise the debenture stocks, details of which are contained in note 12 and an overdraft facility which may be used for short-term funding requirements.
Contingencies, Guarantees and Financial Commitments This note would show any liabilities the Company is committed to honour, but which are dependent on future circumstances or events occurring.
There are no contingencies, guarantees or financial commitments of the Company at the year end 2014: nil.
