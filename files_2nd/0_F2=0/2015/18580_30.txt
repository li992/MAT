142 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2015 39.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation We have prepared these Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
We have applied the accounting policies consistently throughout the current and prior year.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
The Companys financial statements are included in the Genus plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2015.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing transactions with other members of the Genus Group.
Fixed assets and depreciation We state fixed assets at cost, together with any incidental acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
We calculate depreciation on a straight-line basis, to write the assets down to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are as follows: Leasehold land and buildings period of lease Equipment 3 to 20 years We review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments We state fixed assets investments at cost less provision for impairment.
Pensions A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
We charge contributions to profit and loss as they become payable under the schemes rules.
We show differences between the contributions payable and the amounts actually paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The schemes assets are held separately from those of the Company.
Certain current and former employees of the Company are members of one of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, further details of which are given in note 28 of the Group Financial Statements.
The schemes are all multiemployer defined benefit schemes, whose assets and liabilities are held independently from the Group.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the schemes underlying assets and liabilities, and therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Taxation We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
We recognise deferred taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
We only recognise deferred taxation assets if we consider it more likely than not that we will have suitable profits from which we can deduct the future reversal of the underlying timing differences.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements, and which are capable of reversing in one or more subsequent periods.
We only recognise deferred taxation in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
We measure deferred taxation on a non-discounted basis, at the tax rates we expect to apply in the periods in which we expect the timing differences to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies We record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate ruling at the transaction date or at the contracted rate, if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
We retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the prevailing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Genus plcAnnual Report 2015 STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL 143 REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION Treasury shares The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, which requires us to recognise the assets and liabilities associated with the Companys investment in its own shares in the Companys financial statements, where there is fide facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Companys own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust remain deducted from shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Employee share schemes The Companys Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers receive part of their remuneration in the form of share awards, which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three year period.
We measure the cost of these awards by reference to the shares fair value at the award date.
At the end of each financial reporting period, we estimate the extent to which the performance criteria will be met at the end of three years, and record an appropriate charge in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding credit to profit and loss reserves.
Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit and loss account in subsequent periods.
Share-based payments We have implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with subsidiary undertakings under UITF 44, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings under an equity-settled arrangement, and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company for these rights.
Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiarys accounts as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an equal amount.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
We use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk.
We also use forward foreign currency contracts, implemented through a medium-term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap, to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiary entities.
Forward foreign currency contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not in its balance sheet.
Our use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Groups policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors.
The notes to the Group Financial Statements include information about the Groups financial risks and their management, and its use of financial instruments and their impact on the Groups risk profile, performance and financial condition.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve.
We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the profit and loss account.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, then we reclassify the associated gains and losses that we had recognised directly in equity into profit or loss.
We do this in the same period or periods that the asset or liability affects profit or loss, which are the periods when we recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If we no longer expect the hedged transaction to occur, we immediately recognise in the profit and loss account the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We treat derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts as separate derivatives, when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses reported in the profit and loss account.

Significant accounting policies continued Debt We initially state debt at the amount of the net proceeds, after deducting issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Finance costs We charge the finance costs of debt to the profit and loss account over the debt term, at a constant rate on the carrying value of the debt to which they relate.
