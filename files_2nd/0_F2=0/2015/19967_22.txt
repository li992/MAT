Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 26 February 2015 1A uthorisation of consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 26 February 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 27 April 2015.
Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in Note 4, Segment information.
2Accounting policies Basis of accounting and preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 27 February 2014, except for a change in presentation and the adoption of the new Standards and Interpretations that are applicable for the year ended 26 February 2015 detailed as follows: Change in presentation There have been some minor changes to the presentation of the consolidated income statement and the consolidated cash flow statement.
The consolidated income statement has been amended to remove the profit before tax and exceptionals subtotal.
The directors do not use this definition anymore to manage the business and therefore references to before exceptional in the statements have been removed.
Certain categories in the consolidated cash flow statement have been reclassified and the corresponding comparatives re presented.
Interest received has moved from investing activities to operating activities, bringing it in line with interest payable.
Payments against provisions and pension payments have been reclassified from cash generated from operations to net cash flows from operating activities.
This is more representative of the nature of the cash flows.
Amendment to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for NonFinancial Assets This amendment addresses the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal.
Whilst applicable to the Group, the impairment values for this year are immaterial and therefore no further disclosure is necessary.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities Identifies the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off balance sheet vehicles.
Additional disclosure has been provided where relevant in the financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following standards and interpretations which have been assessed as having no financial impact or disclosure requirements at this time: IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as revised in 2011 : IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and  to IAS 32: IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge AccountingAmendments to IAS 39: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 93 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 26 February 2015 2Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associate incorporated using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of principal subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company except for Yueda Costa Shanghai Food & Beverage Management Company Limited which has a yearend of 31 December as per Chinese legislation.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary which significantly affect the subsidiarys return so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 01, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from, or up to, the date that control passes respectively.
All intraGroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable, or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated life of the asset as follows: trading licences have an indefinite life: reacquired franchise rights are amortised over the life of the acquired franchise agreement: IT software and technology is amortised over periods of three to six years: the asset in relation to acquired customer relationships is amortised over 15 years: and operating rights agreements are amortised over the life of the contract.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Prior to the 1999 2000 financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis.
Since this date, the Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, whilst previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of qualifying assets are capitalised until the time that the assets are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: freehold land is not depreciated: freehold buildings do not depreciate where the residual value is the same, or exceeds, net book value: long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years: and plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The residual values are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the values of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 94 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 2Accounting policies continued Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into, or acquiring, leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease payments.
These are amortised on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes, at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the CGUs recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a straightline basis over its remaining useful life.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating costs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU, on a prorata basis.
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value, less the costs of disposal, of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less the costs of disposal and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment, the Group considers each trading outlet to be a separate CGU.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset either from independent sources or, in conjunction with, an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Investments in joint ventures and associates The Group assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
Where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.
Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 95 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 26 February 2015 2Accounting policies continued Assets held for sale Noncurrent assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Such assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value, less the cost to sell, and are not depreciated or amortised.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
Provisions Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Non underlying performance measure To monitor the financial performance of the Group, certain items are excluded from the profit measure.
This measure is called underlying and represents the business performance excluding items that the directors consider could distort the understanding of the performance or the comparability between periods.
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated having adjusted profit after tax on the same basis.
The term underlying profit is not defined under IFRSs and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profit.
The adjustments made to reported profit in the consolidated income statement, in order to present an underlying performance measure, include: Exceptional items The Group includes in non underlying performance measures those items which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group includes within exceptional items the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions, profit or loss on the sale of a business, impairment and exceptional interest and tax: IAS 19 income statement finance charge credit for defined benefit pension schemes Underlying profit excludes the finance cost revenue element of IAS 19 as this does not relate to the Groups ongoing activities as the schemes are closed to future accrual: Amortisation charge on acquired intangible assets Underlying profit excludes the amortisation charge on acquired intangible assets as this relates to transactions outside of the underlying business: and Taxation The tax impact of the items above is also excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date.
Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency generally sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Dayto day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a nonsterling functional currency.
The financial performance and end position of these entities are translated into sterling in the consolidated financial statements.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 96 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 2Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of the goods or services provided have transferred to the buyer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable from the sale of goods and services to third parties after deducting discounts, allowances for customer loyalty and other promotional activities.
Revenue includes duties which the Group pays as principal, but excludes amounts collected on behalf of other parties, such as value added tax.
All sales between Group businesses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue of the Group comprises the following streams: Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of food, beverages and merchandise is recognised at the point of sale, with the exception of wholesale transactions which are recognised on delivery.
The Group operate some customer loyalty programmes.
Where award credits are granted as part of a sale transaction, a portion of revenue equal to the fair value of the award points earned is deferred until redemption.
The fair value of points awarded is determined with reference to the discount received upon redemption and the level of redemption: Rendering of services Revenue from room sales and other guest services is recognised when rooms are occupied and as services are provided: and Franchise fees Revenue from fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names is recognised when earned.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Remeasurements are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with net interest costs reported within finance costs.
In addition, all administration costs, other than those relating to the management of plan assets or taxes payable by the plan itself, are charged as incurred to operating costs in the income statement.
Net interest is calculated by applying the opening discount rate to the opening net defined benefit obligation taking into account the expected contributions and benefits paid.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 97 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 26 February 2015 2Accounting policies continued Sharebased payment transactions Equitysettled transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equitysettled remuneration in the form of sharebased payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they are granted.
The cost of equitysettled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions or nonvesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
Except for awards subject to marketrelated conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions, at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
If options are subject to marketrelated conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets being met.
Instead, these conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equitysettled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
Where an equitysettled award is forfeited, the related expense recognised to date is reversed.
Cashsettled transactions The cost is fairvalued at grant date and expensed over the period until the vesting date, with recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement for the period.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profit for the year and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts that have originated but have not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or the initial recognition of an asset or liability, in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all, or part of, the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are charged or credited directly to equity.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.

The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset.
The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
On initial recognition these assets are recognised at fair value.
Subsequent measurement is also at fair value, with changes recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available forsale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and shortterm deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, cash in hand and shortterm deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest and currency risks associated with underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Cash flow hedges mitigate exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Fair value hedges mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment and include foreign currency swaps.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the applicable market yield curves at the balance sheet date.
The portion of any gains or losses on cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be effective, is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The change in fair value, of derivatives designated as part of a fair value hedge, is recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
The change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, that is attributable to the hedged risk, is also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 99 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 26 February 2015 2Accounting policies continued Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
When a fair value hedge item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and the redemption value, recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported as revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Impairment An impairment test of tangible and intangible assets is undertaken each year on both an EBITDA multiple approach and a discounted cash flow approach.
Note 15 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions: Residual values and asset lives The residual value is the net realisable value of an asset at the end of its useful economic life.
The Group has taken an assessment of the residual values that are appropriate for the business and reviews this assessment annually.
Asset lives are based upon the managements estimation at the point of capitalisation.
Periodically these are reviewed to ensure that the estimated life of the assets are accurate and if not the assets are relifed prospectively: Onerous contracts provisions Judgement involving estimates is used in determining the value of provisions carried for onerous contracts.
This is primarily based around assumptions on rent and propertyrelated costs for the period the property is vacant as well as assumptions of future rental incomes or potential reverse lease premiums paid.
Note 23 provides details of the value of the provisions carried: Defined benefit pension Defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with actuarial advice using the projected unit credit method.
Note 31 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions: and Taxation The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items, where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material income statement and or cash flow variances.
Corporation tax is calculated on the basis of income before taxation, taking into account the relevant local tax rates and regulations.
For each operating entity, the current income tax expense is calculated and differences between the accounting and tax base are determined, resulting in deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable expenses and these affect the income tax calculation.
Provisions may be made for uncertain exposures or recoveries, which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
Assumptions are also made around the tax net book value of assets to which capital allowances apply, the level of capital allowances, the extent of rollover gains, indexation thereon and the tax base into which they have been rolled.
A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses, pension deficits and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised.
Detailed amounts of the carrying value of corporation and deferred tax can be found in Note 9.

A complete version of the standard was issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 covers the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model and a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment.
The new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption.
The Group is currently considering the impact of IFRS 9 on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014.
The new standard provides a single, fivestep revenue recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.
It replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, subject to EU adoption.

The UK and International Hotels & Restaurants segments have been aggregated on the grounds that the International segment is immaterial.
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
Segment performance is measured based on underlying operating profit.
Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables below are the costs of running the public company.
The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances held and controlled by the central treasury function, taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment, centrally held provisions and central working capital balances.
Intersegment revenue is from Costa to the Hotels & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation.
Transactions are entered into on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with thirdparties.
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding business operating segments for the years ended 26 February 2015 and 27 February 2014.

The corporation tax balance is a liability of 35.4m 2014: liability of 35.1m.
Deferred tax Deferred tax relates to the following: Consolidated Consolidated balance sheet income statement 2015 2014 2014 15 2013 14 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated capital allowances 52.0 50.3 0.3 7.5 Rolled over gains and property revaluations 82.6 86.0 3.3 59.0 Gross deferred tax liabilities 134.6 136.3 Deferred tax assets Pensions 82.6 78.7 3.1 4.0 Other 8.3 10.8 0.3 1.4 Gross deferred tax assets 90.9 89.5 Deferred tax expense 6.4 71.9 Net deferred tax liability 43.7 46.8 Total deferred tax liabilities released as a result of disposals during the year was nil 2014: nil.
The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose.
The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability of these losses and does not think it is appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax assets.
If the Group were to recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by 10.0m 2014: 6.2m, of which, the share attributable to the parent shareholders is 7.8m 2014: 5.0m.
At 26 February 2015, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2014: nil for taxes that would be payable on any unremitted earnings, as all such amounts are permanently reinvested or, where they are not, there are no corporation tax consequences of such companies paying dividends to parent companies.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to 0.8m 2014: 0.6m.
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years The Finance Act 2013 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The effect of the new rate was included in the accounts for 2013 14.

Life Coffee Caf Limited was a franchise partner and operated 16 Costa franchise operations.
On 26 February 2015, Premier Inn Hotels Limited acquired two trading hotels for a cash consideration of 9.3m.

The goodwill arising on acquisition relates to the Life Coffee Caf Limited acquisition and arises as a result of the expected synergies from the business combination.
Included in the acquisition was 0.7m of loans.
From the date of acquisition, the business combination contributed 0.7m revenue and 0.1m profit to the Group.
If the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group would have been increased by 1.7m and the revenue by 11.1m.

The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the year.
Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option price, the options become antidilutive and are excluded from the calculation.

The trading licences, which have a carrying value of 1.8m 2014: 1.8m, are deemed to have indefinite useful lives as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to contribute to the Groups net cash inflow.
The operating rights agreements are being amortised between six years and ten years and have a carrying value of 1.7m 2014: 2.0m.
Development costs have a carrying value of 1.3m 2014: 1.7m and are being amortised over six years.

2015 2014 Capital expenditure commitments m m Capital expenditure commitments for property, plant and equipment for which no provision has been made 123.5 52.3 In addition to the capital expenditure commitments disclosed above, the Group has also signed agreements with certain thirdparties to develop new trading outlets within the Hotels & Restaurants strategic business unit as part of its pipeline.
These developments are dependant upon the outcome of future events, such as the granting of planning permission, and consequently do not represent a binding capital commitment at the yearend.
The directors consider that developments likely to proceed as planned will result in further capital investment of 440.0m over the next five years 2014: 210.0m.
Capitalised interest Interest capitalised during the year amounted to 4.3m, using an average rate of 4.1% 2013 14: 2.6m, using an average rate of 4.1%.
Assets held for sale Three sites with a combined net book value of 1.1m 2014: 1.5m continued to be classified as held for sale at the yearend.
An impairment loss of 0.4m 2013 14: 0.4m was recognised in the year.
During 2013 14, certain property assets with combined book value of 4.7m were reclassified as assets held for sale and property assets sold during the same year had a net book value of 4.3m.

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pretax discount rate of 8.6% in the UK 2013 14: 9.9%, 9.5% in China 2013 14: 10.6% and 9.9% in Poland 2013 14: 11.1%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a fiveyear period.
These business plans and forecasts include managements most recent view of mediumterm trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate based upon the relevant countrys inflation target, ranging from 1.5% to 6.0% with the UK, the most significant country, being 2.0% 2013 14: 2.0%.
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of 5.2m are set out below: Hotels & Restaurants The impairment of 2.9m at eight sites in this strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors: changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated: decisions to exit some sites where current market values are lower than book values: and high asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites and also anticipated higher growth rates at that time than are now expected.
Costa The 2.3m impairment charge includes two UK and 31 international sites, where stores are to be closed or are underperforming.
The noncontrolling interest portion of this cost was 0.7m 2013 14: 0.7m.
Impairment reversals Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously impaired sites, reversals of 8.6m have been recognised, 8.1m in Hotels & Restaurants and 0.5m in Costa.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount rates applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the fiveyear business plans and in the pretax discount rates would be an incremental impairment charge of: Hotels & Restaurants Costa Total Incremental impairment charge m m m Impairment if business plan growth rates were reduced by 1% pt 2.4 2.4 Impairment if discount rates were increased by 1% pt 2.2 2.2 Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 115 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 26 February 2015 15Impairment continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2013 14: 2.0%.
The pretax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.6% 2013 14: 9.9%.
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to either the Hotels & Restaurants CGU or the Costa CGU.

Provision is made for rent and other propertyrelated costs for the period that a sublet or assignment of the lease is not possible.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sublet, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by both internal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the estimated cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% 2014: 3.74% based on an approximation for the time value of money.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variations.
The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both internal and external property experts to determine the provision held.
Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period of up to 25 years.

The Groups financial instruments policy can be found in Note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the financial risks summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups longterm sterling debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt in conjunction with private placement loan notes.
The Groups policy is to maintain fixed rate debt between 35% and 65% of total debt.
Some transactions can lead to a deviation from this policy but not without prior approval from the Group Finance Director.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
At the yearend, 313.0m 61.1% of the Groups longterm debt was fixed for an average of 4.88 years at an average interest rate of 5.0% 2014: 296.5m, 68.5%, for 5.88 years, at 5.0%.
Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, crosscurrency swaps mean that the interest rate risk is effectively sterling only.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 26 February 2015 and 27 February 2014 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 2: and cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the yearend, a 1% pt change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 2.0m 2013 14: 1.4m, and equity by approximately 16.6m 2014: 5.2m.
Liquidity risk In its funding strategy, the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interestbearing deposit where maturity is fixed at no more than three months.
Shortterm flexibility is achieved through the use of shortterm borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 26 February 2015 and 27 February 2014 based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest: On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 26 February 2015 m m m m m m Interestbearing loans and borrowings 71.2 0.3 13.4 383.4 174.7 643.0 Derivative financial instruments 1.8 1.8 6.9 4.1 14.6 Trade and other payables 166.8 20.5 187.3 Accrued financial liabilities 177.6 177.6 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 1.7 5.0 9.6 17.6 33.9 71.2 170.6 197.8 420.4 196.4 1,056.4 On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 27 February 2014 m m m m m m Interestbearing loans and borrowings 0.3 11.5 333.1 173.0 517.9 Derivative financial instruments 2.1 2.1 12.2 6.1 22.5 Trade and other payables 156.4 17.7 174.1 Accrued financial liabilities 158.2 158.2 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 3.2 9.6 12.6 16.9 42.3 162.0 181.4 375.6 196.0 915.0 Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 122 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 24Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and any known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 19.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into financial difficulty, the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group.
Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan notes, these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been carried out.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and when they are required.
Capital management The Groups primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern and has sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants.
See pages 42 to 45 of this Report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Groups credit facilities and financing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets.
The Group has adopted a framework to keep leverage debt divided by EBITDAR on a pensions and lease adjusted basis at 3.5 times or below, which was achieved for the year ended 26 February 2015.
This calculation takes account of net debt, the pension deficit and the capital value of leases.
The management of equity through share buy backs and new issues is considered as part of the overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth.
In addition, the Group may carry out a number of small sale and leaseback transactions to provide further funding for growth.
The Groups financing is subject to financial covenants.
These covenants relate to the measurement of EBITDA against consolidated net finance charges interest cover and total net debt leverage ratio, on a notadjustedfor pension and property lease basis.
The Group has complied with all of these covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.
In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding strategy.
25Financial instruments Fair values As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities disclosed in Notes 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 26 are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date using level 2 techniques.
Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 123 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 26 February 2015 25Financial instruments continued Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The classification uses the following threelevel hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Other techniques for which all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Techniques which use inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, that are not based on observable market data.

Derivative financial instruments include 2.2m assets 2014: nil and 13.8m liabilities 2014: 24.7m due after one year.
Derivative financial instruments Hedges Cash flow hedges At 26 February 2015, the Group has interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 100.0m 2014: 100.0m whereby it receives variable interest rates based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 5.372% 2014: 5.145% and 5.372%.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
The Group also has crosscurrency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of between 3.92% and 4.86% 2014: 3.92% and 4.86% on a notional amount of US$250.0m 2014: US$250.0m and pays an average of 4.72% on a notional sterling balance of 158.2m 2014: 4.72% on 158.2m.
There are 50.0m of swaps 2014: 50.0m with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facility 2019 which are in place to hedge against the core level of debt the Group will hold.
The ineffectiveness recorded within finance costs in the income statement for 2014 15, a debit of 14.0k, and 2013 14, a credit of 6.0k was immaterial.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 26 February 2015 and a net unrealised loss of 3.0m 2013 14: net unrealised gain of 1.4m has been recorded in other comprehensive income.
Fair value hedges At 26 February 2015, the Group has crosscurrency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 5.23% 2014: 5.23% on a notional amount of $75.0m 2014: $75.0m and pays a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% 2014: 1.715% and 1.755% over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of 50.1m 2014: 50.1m.
The fair value hedges were also assessed to be highly effective at 26 February 2015.
An increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap of 4.4m 2013 14: a reduction of 7.3m offset by a loss in the fair value of the hedged items of 3.9m 2013 14: gain of 6.4m led to a credit of 0.5m recorded within finance revenue in the income statement 2013 14: a debit of 0.9m in finance costs in the income statement.
Cash flow and fair value hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in Note 24.

Other than shares issued in the normal course of business as part of the sharebased payments schemes and those issued in respect of scrip dividends, there have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares since the reporting date and before the completion of these consolidated financial statements.
28Reserves Share premium The share premium reserve is the premium paid on the Companys 76.80p ordinary shares.
The issue of shares in lieu of cash dividends was treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share premium account.
Capital redemption reserve A capital redemption reserve was created on the cancellation of the Groups B and C preference shares Note 27 and also includes the nominal value of cancelled ordinary shares.
Retained earnings In accordance with IFRS practice, retained earnings include revaluation reserves which are not distributable under UK law.
Currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the consolidated financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and other foreign currency investments.
Treasury reserve This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust ESOT and treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC.
The shares held by the ESOT were purchased in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and potential awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and other incentive schemes.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose as a consequence of the merger in 2000 01 of Whitbread Group PLC and Whitbread PLC.
Hedging reserve This reserve records movements for effective cash flow hedges measured at fair value.
The total of the treasury, merger and hedging reserves equals other reserves in the consolidated balance sheet.

29Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses.
The leases are noncancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time e. g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices, future market rates of interest.
Future minimum rentals payable under noncancellable operating leases, on an undiscounted basis, are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Due within one year 196.6 173.0 Due after one year but not more than five years 671.1 598.2 Due after five years but not more than ten years 629.4 543.3 Due after ten years 1,335.6 1,263.2 2,832.7 2,577.7 Future minimum rentals payable under noncancellable operating leases disclosed above includes 78.6m in relation to privity contracts 2014: 109.7m.
Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerous contracts provision Note 23.
Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under noncancellable operating leases is 13.3 years 2014: 14.0 years.
Group companies have sublet space in certain properties.
The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under noncancellable sublease agreements as at 26 February 2015 are 58.5m 2014: 67.3m of which 45.9m 2014: 53.7m relates to privity contracts.
Contingent liabilities There are no contingent liabilities to be disclosed in the year ended 26 February 2015 2014: nil.

Vesting of all shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting earnings per share EPS performance targets over a threeyear period the vesting period.
In addition, awards from 2012 onwards are dependent on meeting a return on capital employed ROCE target over the vesting period.
Grants prior to this were dependent on meeting a total shareholder return TSR target over the vesting period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen in the remuneration report on pages 62 to 76.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2015 2014 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 977,348 958,874 Granted during the year 202,809 320,130 Exercised during the year 329,389 250,299 Expired during the year 33,126 51,357 Outstanding at the end of the year 817,642 977,348 Exercisable at the end of the year 5,497 35,310 Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 05.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason, the proportion of awards which vest depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date that employment ceased.
If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the awards vest, between the first and second anniversary, 25% vest and between the second and third anniversary, 50% vest.

The shares can be purchased over the sixmonth period following the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement date, depending on the length chosen by the employee.
Movements in the number of share options and the related weighted average exercise price WAEP are as follows: 2015 2014 WAEP WAEP Options per share Options per share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 1,099,022 19.58 1,125,508 16.27 Granted during the year 535,621 35.07 385,072 27.46 Exercised during the year 249,888 12.75 225,863 10.79 Expired during the year 160,211 23.48 185,695 16.84 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,224,544 27.30 1,099,022 19.58 Exercisable at the end of the year 60,083 13.01 23,226 10.93 The weighted average contractual life of the share options outstanding as at 26 February 2015 is between two and three years.
Outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares of 76.80 pence between 2014 and 2019 are exercisable at prices between 10.08 and 35.07 2014: between 2013 and 2018 at prices between 7.28 and 27.46.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for employee share scheme options exercised during the year was 49.01 2014: 37.62.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The riskfree rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested, trusteeadministered funds.
The Group also had a contractedout defined contribution pension scheme which was wound up during 2012.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution scheme, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the scheme.
The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined contribution scheme in the year was 7.2m 2013 14: 6.8m.
At the yearend, 26,673 employees 2014: 25,770 were active members of the scheme, which also had 4,282 deferred members 2014: 4,172.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund is set up under UK trust law, registered with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs and regulated by the Pensions Regulator.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund is governed by a corporate trustee which operates the scheme in accordance with the requirements of UK pensions legislation.
At the yearend, the scheme had no active members 2014: nil, 23,543 deferred pensioners 2014: 24,161 and 16,696 pensions in payment 2014: 16,681.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The IAS 19 R pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from, and calculations provided by Lane Clark & Peacock, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
As the scheme is closed to future accrual, there is no future service cost.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 17.5 years 2014: 17.5 years.

A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2014.
A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit, have been agreed with the Trustee.
The Group made a 70.0m payment in 2014 15 and will make the following payments to the Fund: 65.0m in August 2015: 70.0m in August 2016: 80.0m in August 2017: 80.0m in August 2018: 80.0m in August 2019: 80.0m in August 2020: 80.0m in August 2021 and 17.0m in August 2022.
For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower.
Until the next valuation, the Trustee has also been given a promise of accelerated payments of up to 5.0m per annum where increases in ordinary dividends exceed RPI and the right to consultation before any special distributions can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate SLP, which was established by the Group in the year ended 4 March 2010 the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid.
The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner and by the Pension Scheme.
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership SP, which was also established by the Group during 2009 10.
Property assets with a market value of 221.0m have been transferred from other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
However, the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of 228.0m.
The Group retains control over both partnerships and, as such, they are fully consolidated in these consolidated financial statements.
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership over the next ten years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will, depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up to a value of 150.0m 2014: 150.0m.
Under IAS 19 R, the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly the pension deficit position in these consolidated financial statements does not reflect the 165.8m 2014: 141.0m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
During the year ended 28 February 2013, the Group entered into a charge in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited over properties with a market value totalling 180.0m at that date.
The charge was to secure the obligations of the Group to make payments to the Pension Fund as part of the recovery plan to reduce the deficit.
This, together with the properties secured as a consequence of the arrangement surrounding the partnerships, secures properties totalling 408.0m in favour of the Pension Scheme.
Risks Through its defined benefit scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to the IAS 19 R deficit, the most significant of which are detailed below: Principal impact on assets Risk Description and obligation reconciliations Market volatility The defined benefit obligation is linked to AArated corporate bonds whilst scheme Return on plan assets assets are invested in equities, gilts, bonds, property and cash.
This exposes the Group to risks including those relating to interest rates, equity markets, property markets and foreign exchange.
Changing market conditions, in conjunction with discount rate fluctuations, will lead to volatility in the Groups net pension liability on the balance sheet, pension expense in the income statement and remeasurement movements in other comprehensive income.
Inflationary risk Due to the link between the scheme obligation and inflation, an increased rate Actuarial movements in financial of inflation will lead to higher scheme liabilities.
assumptions Accounting The defined benefit obligation is calculated by projecting the future cash flows Discount rate: interest income on assumptions of the scheme for many years into the future.
Consequently, the assumptions used scheme assets and cost on liabilities can have a significant impact on the balance sheet position and income statement charge.
In practice, future scheme experience may not be in line with the assumptions Mortality: actuarial movements adopted.
For example, an increase in the life expectancy of members would increase in demographic assumptions scheme liabilities.

The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.2 years 2014: 20.0 years if they are male and for a further 24.3 years 2014: 22.6 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2035 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.7 years 2014: 21.9 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.6 years 2014: 24.4 years after retirement if they are female.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows: 2014 15 2013 14 m m Net interest on net defined benefit liability 21.6 23.6 Administrative expenses 3.0 2.5 Total expense recognised in the income statement gross of deferred tax 24.6 26.1 Amounts recognised in operating profit for service costs or curtailment are nil 2013 14: nil.
The amounts taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income are as follows: 2014 15 2013 14 m m Actuarial losses 339.7 77.7 Return on plan assets greater than discount rate 263.4 40.0 Remeasurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 76.3 37.7 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Present value of defined benefit obligation 2,447.8 2,104.9 Fair value of scheme assets 1,894.0 1,570.6 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 553.8 534.3 During the year, the accounting deficit increased from 534.3m at 27 February 2014 to 553.8m at 26 February 2015.
The principal reasons for this deterioration were a reduction in the discount rate and updated mortality assumptions partially offset by asset returns exceeding the assumed interest on the assets and employer contributions in excess of the pension expense for the year.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Opening defined benefit obligation 2,104.9 2,021.6 Interest cost 88.7 91.1 Remeasurement due to: Changes in financial assumptions 276.4 74.0 Changes in demographic assumptions 84.5 Experience adjustments 21.2 3.7 Benefits paid 85.4 85.4 1 Benefits settled by the Group in relation to an unfunded pension scheme 0.1 0.1 Closing defined benefit obligation 2,447.8 2,104.9 Whitbread Consolidated Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 accounts 2014 15 132 Overview p1 3 Strategic report p4 47 Governance p48 81 Consolidated accounts 2014 15 p83 135 Company accounts 2014 15 p137 142 31Retirement benefits continued Changes in the fair value of the scheme assets are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Opening fair value of scheme assets 1,570.6 1,479.9 Interest income on scheme assets 67.1 67.5 Return on plan assets greater than discount rate 263.4 40.0 1 Contributions from employer 72.4 62.4 1 Additional contributions from Moorgate SLP 8.9 8.7 Benefits paid 85.4 85.4 Administrative expenses 3.0 2.5 Closing fair value of scheme assets 1,894.0 1,570.6 The major categories of plan assets are as follows: 2015 2014 Quoted and Quoted and pooled Unquoted Total pooled Unquoted Total m m m m m m 2 Equities 869.0 88.4 957.4 787.5 88.4 875.9 Government bonds 532.3 532.3 322.8 322.8 2 Corporate bonds 124.6 25.4 150.0 154.5 154.5 Property 123.6 46.4 170.0 105.3 34.7 140.0 3 Other 84.3 84.3 77.4 77.4 1,733.8 160.2 1,894.0 1,447.5 123.1 1,570.6 The assumptions in relation to discount rate, inflation and mortality have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Increase decrease in liability 2015 2014 m m Discount rate 0.25% increase to discount rate 103.0 88.0 0.25% decrease to discount rate 114.0 88.0 Inflation 0.25% increase to inflation rate 86.0 84.0 0.25% decrease to inflation rate 82.0 84.0 Life expectancy Additional one year increase to life expectancy 83.0 75.0 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method projected unit credit method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumption did not change.

2 Certain quoted and unquoted property funds have been reclassified from equity to property this year and therefore use have restated the prior year to be consistent.
3 Other relates to assets held in respect of cash and net current assets.
