Strategic report Governance Financial statements Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 | 135 European embedded value EEV Supplementary financial statements Just Retirement Group plc has prepared supplementary financial statements for the Group on an EEV basis.
The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the CFO Forum of European Insurance Companies in May 2004 and additional guidance issued in October 2005.
Life insurance products are, by their nature, long-term and the profit on this business is generated over a significant number of years.
Accounting under IFRS alone does not, in the Groups opinion, fully reflect the value of future cash flows.
The Group considers that embedded value reporting provides investors with a measure of the future profit streams of the Groups in-force long-term business and is a valuable supplement to statutory accounts.
