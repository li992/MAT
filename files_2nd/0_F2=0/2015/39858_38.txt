Sustainability 146 Dividends and Debenture Interest Proposed 2015 final dividend: Glossary of terms 156 Ex-dividend 21 January 2016 Record date 22 January 2016 Payment date 12 February 2016 2016 interim dividend to be paid July 2016 Debenture stock interest to be paid 31 March 2016 and 30 September 2016 Effect of REIT status on payment of dividends REITs do not pay UK corporation tax in respect of rental profits and chargeable gains relating to property rental business.
However, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their qualifying income broadly calculated using the UK tax rules as a PID.
Certain categories of shareholder may be able to receive the PID element of their dividends gross, without deduction of withholding tax.
Categories which may claim this exemption include: UK companies, charities, local authorities, UK pension schemes and managers of PEPs, ISAs and Child Trust Funds.
Further information and the forms for completion to apply for PIDs to be paid gross are available on the Groups website or from the registrar.
The deadline for completed forms to be with the registrar for payment of the 2015 final dividend is 22 January 2016.
Where the Group pays an ordinary dividend, in addition to the PID, this will be treated in the same way as dividends from non-REIT companies.
