Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 1.
Basis of preparation Following the publication of FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements by the Financial Reporting Council, the Company has changed its accounting framework for its entity financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Directors considered, and no shareholders objected, that it was in the best interest of the Company to adopt FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.

The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
As discussed on page 37 of the Directors Report, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the going concern basis continues to be used in preparing these Financial Statements.
As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash-flow statement and certain related party transactions.
