The LTIP measures performance targets over a three year period.
Options will normally vest, subject to performance targets being achieved, on the third anniversary of the date of grant at a nominal cost to the employee.
Employees who leave with a right to exercise options must normally wait until the end of the measurement period.
If the option vests, the employee will receive an entitlement which normally will be time apportioned for the period from the start of the measurement period to the date on which employment ended.
Options granted in 2015 to executive directors and band 1 and 2 executives are subject to two performance conditions, compound annual growth in underlying earnings per share EPS and relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, in the proportion 75% and 25%, respectively.
The EPS element has a return on capital employed underpin.
These options are equity settled.
Options granted in 2015 to other senior management are subject to 100% EPS.
These options are cash settled.
Options include a dividend equivalent element whereby employees will be entitled to receive, in cash, the notional dividends paid during the measurement period on any options that vest.
For further details of the LTIP refer to the directors remuneration report.
SAYE All employee SAYE schemes are open to eligible employees resident in the UK and Ireland.
Grants of options over shares are made at an exercise price of 80% of the market value of Rexam shares at the invitation date.
Options vest three, five or seven years after the commencement of the savings contract, depending on the term selected by the employee at grant and expire six months after vesting.
No options were granted in 2015.
Deferred Bonus Rexam executive directors receive 25% of any annual bonus as a deferred award over Rexam ordinary shares.
These shares must be held for a period of not less than three years.
There are no further vesting conditions.
For further details of the deferred bonus plan refer to the directors remuneration report.
ESOS Prior to 2009, annual grants of options over ordinary shares were made to certain senior management.
For grants up to and including 2006, shares vested if a performance target growth in economic profit was met over the three year measurement period.
No performance targets were set for the 2007 and 2008 grants.
Options are exercisable three years after grant date and expire ten years after grant date.
The exercise price was set at market value using the market price of a Rexam share at the grant date.
