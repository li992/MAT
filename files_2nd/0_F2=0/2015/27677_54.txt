Financials 216 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2015 G: Analysis of financial assets and liabilities G1: Loans and advances The Group extends advances to individuals and to the corporate, commercial and public sectors.
The majority of loans and advances are in respect of Nedbank which represents 96% 29,873 million : 2014: 97% 33,773 million of the Groups net loans and advances.
Nedbank assesses its loan portfolios for impairment at each financial reporting date and manages its exposure to loans and advances through a documented credit approval processes.
Emerging Markets has lending exposure, net of credit impairment provisions, of 912 million 2014: 909 million through its non-wholly owned subsidiaries in South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe.
Credit loss ratios are monitored at each individual business unit level.
Interest earned on loans and advances is analysed in Note D3: Banking interest and similar income and credit impairment charges are included in note G1 d Provision for impairment.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Provisions for impairment of loans and advances The impairment for performing loans is calculated on a portfolio basis, based on historical loss experience, adjusted for national and sector-specific economic conditions and other indicators present at the reporting date that correlate with defaults on the portfolio.
These include early arrears, such as changes in macro-economic conditions and legislation affecting credit recovery.
These annual loss ratios are applied to loan balances in the portfolio and scaled to the estimated loss emergence period.
For portfolios of loans and advances which comprise large numbers of small, homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on the portfolio, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
There are a number of models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or client category.
Judgement and knowledge are needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
Additional impairment provisions may be raised for issues which the Group believes are not specifically covered by statistical models.
For wholesale larger exposures impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account.
The level of impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculations of future cash flows and change with time as new information becomes available or as strategies evolve, resulting in revisions to the impairment provision as individual decisions are taken.

At 31 December 2015, the Group recognised collateral of 16 million 2014: 33 million in the statement of financial position.
These amounts are being included in the loans and advances above as properties in possession.
Financial collateral The Group takes financial collateral to support exposures in its banking and securities and lending activities.

OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 223 G4: Derivative financial instruments assets and liabilities The Group utilises derivative instruments for both economic hedging and trading purposes.
Economic hedging occurs when a derivative financial instrument is taken out for the management of financial risk but does not achieve hedge accounting.
Only where the accounting treatment results in an economic mismatch will the Group undertake hedge accounting.
The derivative instruments become in-the-money or out-of-the-money as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or asset prices relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are in-the-money or out-of-the-money and, therefore, the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
The Group undertakes transactions involving derivative financial instruments with other financial institutions.
Management has established limits commensurate with the credit quality of the institutions with which it deals and manages the resulting exposures such that a default by any individual counterparty is unlikely to have a materially adverse impact on the Group.
The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the Groups derivative financial instruments outstanding at year-end.
These instruments allow the Group and its customers to transfer, modify or reduce their credit, equity market, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

G6: Insurance and investment contracts Life assurance Classification of contracts Life assurance contracts are categorised into insurance contracts, contracts with a discretionary participation feature or investment contracts, in accordance with the classification criteria set out in the paragraphs below.
For the Groups unit-linked assurance business, contracts are separated into an insurance component and an investment component known as unbundling and each unbundled component is accounted for separately in accordance with the accounting policy for that component.
Unit-linked assurance contracts are savings contracts with a small or insignificant component of insurance risk.
Other kinds of contracts are considered and categorised as a whole.
Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event the insured event adversely affects the policyholder are classified as insurance contracts.
Insurance risk is risk other than financial risk.
Contracts accounted for as insurance contracts include life assurance contracts and savings contracts providing more than an insignificant amount of life assurance protection.
Financial risks are the risks of a possible future change in one or more of an interest rate, security price, security index, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, a credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided, in the case of a non-financial variable, that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.
Contracts with discretionary participating features are those under which the policyholder holds a contractual right to receive additional payments as a supplement to guaranteed minimum payments.
These additional payments, the amount and timing of which is at the Groups discretion, represent a significant portion of the total contractual payments.
These are contractually based on 1 the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract, 2 realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the Group or 3 the profit or loss of the Group.
Investment contracts with discretionary participating features, which have no life assurance protection in the policy terms, are accounted for in the same manner as insurance contracts.
Contracts under which the transfer of insurance risk to the Group from the policyholder is not significant or there is no transfer of insurance risk and where there is no discretionary participation are classified as investment contracts.
Such contracts include unit-linked savings and or investment contracts sold without life assurance protection.
Premiums on life assurance Premiums and annuity considerations receivable under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are stated gross of commission and exclude taxes and levies.
Premiums in respect of unit-linked insurance contracts are recognised when the liability is established.
Premiums in respect of other insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are recognised when due for payment.
Outward reinsurance premiums are recognised when due for payment.
Amounts received under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as deposits and credited directly to investment contract liabilities.
Claims paid on life assurance Claims paid under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature include maturities, annuities, surrenders, death and disability payments.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials Maturity and annuity claims are recorded as they fall due for payment.
Death and disability claims and surrenders are accounted for in 225 profit and loss when notified.
Reinsurance recoveries in profit and loss are recognised in profit and loss in the same period as the related claim.
Amounts paid under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as reductions of the investment contract liabilities.
Amounts received under investment contracts, other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are not recorded through profit or loss, except for fee income and investment income attributable to those contracts, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to investment contract liabilities.
Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contract liabilities for African businesses have been computed using a gross premium valuation method.
Provisions in respect of African business have been made in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis as set out in the guidelines issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa in Standard of Actuarial Practice SAP 104 2012.
Under this guideline, provisions are valued using realistic expectations of future experience, with margins for prudence and deferral of profit emergence.
Provisions for investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are also computed using the gross premium valuation method in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis.
Surplus allocated to policyholders but not yet distributed related to these contracts is included as part of life assurance policyholder liabilities as discretionary margins.
Reserves on immediate annuities and guaranteed payments are computed on the prospective deposit method, which produces reserves equal to the present value of future benefit payments.
For other territories, the valuation bases adopted are in accordance with local actuarial practices and methodologies.
Derivative instruments embedded in an insurance contract are not separated and measured at fair value if the embedded derivative itself qualifies for recognition as an insurance contract.
In this case the entire contract is measured as described above.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and intangible assets is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount to the carrying value of the liability at discount rates appropriate to the business in question.
Where a shortfall is identified, an additional provision is made by increasing the liability held.
The provision assumptions and estimation techniques are periodically reviewed, with any changes in estimates reflected in profit or loss as they occur.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross insurance contract liabilities and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
In respect of the South Africa life assurance, shadow accounting is applied to insurance contract liabilities where the underlying measurement of the policyholder liability depends directly on the value of owner-occupied property and the unrealised gains and losses on such property, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The shadow accounting adjustment to insurance contract liabilities is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the unrealised gains or losses on owner-occupied property backing insurance contract liabilities are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as insurance contracts.
Liability adequacy testing is performed to ensure that the carrying amount of the liability for financial guarantee contracts is sufficient.
Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups business other than unit-linked business are recorded at amortised cost unless they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency, for example where the corresponding assets are recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups unit-linked business are recorded at fair value.
For such liabilities, including the deposit component of unbundled unit-linked assurance contracts, fair value is calculated as the account balance, which is the value of the units allocated to the policyholder, based on the bid price of the assets in the underlying fund adjusted for tax.
Investment contract liabilities measured at fair value are subject to a deposit floor such that the liability established cannot be less than the amount repayable on demand.
Acquisition costs Acquisition costs for insurance contracts comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the sale of insurance contracts.
As the gross premium valuation method used in African territories to determine insurance contract liabilities makes implicit allowance for the deferral of acquisition costs, no explicit deferred acquisition cost asset is recognised in the statement of financial position for the contracts issued in these areas.
Deferral of costs on insurance business in other territories is limited to the extent that they are deemed recoverable from available future margins.
Costs incurred in acquiring investment management service contracts Incremental costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service contract are recognised as an asset if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are amortised as the related revenue is recognised.
Costs attributable to investment management service contracts in the asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 226 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2015 G: Analysis of financial assets and liabilities continued G6: Insurance and investment contracts continued Revenue on investment management service contracts Fees charged for investment management services provided in conjunction with an investment contract are recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
Initial fees, which exceed the level of recurring fees and relate to the future provision of services are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which services will be provided.
Fees charged for investment management service contracts by asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
Property & casualty Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party and which are not classified as life insurance are classified as general insurance.
All classes of property & casualty business are accounted for on an annual basis.
Premiums on property & casualty Premiums are stated gross of commissions, exclude taxes and levies and are accounted for in the period in which the risk commences.
The proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of risk after the reporting date is carried forward to subsequent accounting periods as unearned premiums as a liability, so that earned premiums relate to risks carried during the accounting period.
Claims on property & casualty Claims incurred, which are recognised in profit and loss, comprise the settlement and handling costs of paid and outstanding claims arising during the year and adjustments to prior year claim provisions.
Outstanding claims comprise claims incurred up to, but not paid, at the end of the accounting period, whether reported or not.
Outstanding claims do not include any provision for possible future claims where the claims arise under contracts not in existence at the reporting date.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its claim liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and the unearned premium reserve is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events, and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in profit or loss in the financial statements for the period in which the adjustments are made, and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used and estimates made are reviewed regularly.
Acquisition costs on property & casualty Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred and amortised over the period in which the related general insurance premiums are earned.
Reinsurance The Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its net loss potential through the diversification of its risks.
Assets, liabilities and income and expense arising from ceded reinsurance contracts are presented separately from the related assets, liabilities, income and expense from the related insurance contracts because the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its direct obligations to its policyholders.
Only rights under contracts that give rise to a significant transfer of insurance risk are accounted for as reinsurance assets.
Rights under contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for as financial instruments.
Reinsurance premiums for ceded reinsurance are recognised as an expense on a basis that is consistent with the recognition basis for the premiums on the related insurance contracts.
For property & casualty business, reinsurance premiums are expensed over the period that the reinsurance cover is provided based on the expected pattern of the reinsured risks.
The unexpensed portion of ceded reinsurance premiums is included in reinsurance assets.
The amounts recognised as reinsurance assets are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the insurance liabilities held in respect of the related insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets include recoveries due from reinsurance companies in respect of claims paid.
Reinsurance assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date.
An asset is deemed impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after its initial recognition, that the Group may not recover all amounts due, and that the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.
The reinsurers share of policyholder liabilities in Old Mutual Wealth relates to investment contracts where the direct management of assets are ceded to a third party through a reinsurance arrangement.
Due to the nature of the arrangement, there is no transfer of insurance risk.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 227 Critical accounting estimates and judgements Policyholder liabilities Emerging Markets Financial Soundness Valuation discount rate The calculation of the Groups South African life assurance contract liabilities is sensitive to the discount rate used to value the liabilities.
The methodology applied by the Group requires discount rates to be set according to the South African professional guidance note SAP 104.
In line with these principles, the reference rate is selected as the Bond Exchange of South Africa BESA par bond 10-year yield.
The reference rate was relatively volatile over 2015, ranging from 7.
At 31 December 2015, the reference discount rate was 9.9% 2014: 8.0%.
The volatile interest rate environment continued to have a negligible impact on the operating profit for the South African life assurance businesses during 2015, given the continuance of the hedging programme and discretionary margins put in place to mitigate these impacts.
The Group estimates that a 1% reduction in the reference discount rate would result in no profit impact as at 31 December 2015 2014: 2 million, allowing for the mitigating impacts of the hedging programme and discretionary margins in place.
This is due to further management actions to reduce the impact of volatile interest rates on profit in 2015.
Emerging Markets discretionary reserves Technical provisions in South Africa are determined as the aggregate of: Best estimate liabilities, with assumptions allowing for the best estimate of future experience and a market-consistent valuation of financial options and guarantees Compulsory margins, prescribed in terms of the Long Term Insurance Act, 1998 and South African professional actuarial guidance note SAP 104 as explicit changes to actuarial assumptions that increase the level of technical provisions held, and Discretionary margins, permitted by the Long Term Insurance Act, 1998 and SAP 104, to allow for the uncertainty inherent in estimates of future experience after considering available options of managing that experience over time, or to defer the release of profits consistent with policy design or company practice.
Discretionary margins are held as either implicit or explicit margins.
Explicit discretionary margins are derived as conscious changes to assumptions used to project future experience to increase technical provisions.
Implicit discretionary margins arise where the method used to calculate overall technical provisions results in liabilities that are greater than the sum of best estimate liabilities and compulsory margins.
Explicit discretionary margins of R8,602 million 377 million 1.7% of total technical provisions were held at 31 December 2015 2014: R8,261 million 459 million, 1.7% of total technical provisions.
This consisted largely of: Margins held for Mass Foundation Cluster protection business, which allow for the uncertainty related to mortality experience in South Africa, as well as future lapse experience and future investment returns, and to ensure that profit is released appropriately over the term of the policies Margins to allow for the uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to value financial options and guarantees, implied volatility assumptions in particular, which are difficult to hedge due to the short-term nature of the equity option market in South Africa Margins on non-profit annuities, due to the inability to fully match assets to liabilities as a result of the limited availability of long-dated bonds, and to provide for longevity risk, and Margins for the uncertainty inherent in future economic assumptions used to calculate, mainly protection product liabilities, in the Retail Affluent and Mass Foundation Cluster businesses.
Although interest rate hedging is used to manage interest rate risk on these products, the volatility of bond yields in South Africa means that it is difficult to maintain appropriate hedging positions without incurring significant trading costs.
The discretionary margin therefore caters for the residual uncertainty present after allowing for the hedge programme that is in place.
Old Mutual Bermuda guarantees Since the sale of Old Mutual Bermuda Ltd OMB to Beechwood Bermuda Limited on 31 December 2015, OMB no longer owns underlying policies or manages policyholder funds.
The Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefits GMAB risk on the remaining active variable annuity contracts is to be retained until the last GMAB policy with a Universal Guarantee Option UGO rider passes its 10-year anniversary, which will be no later than August 2018.
Almost all of the current risk relates to GMAB policies sold with Universal Guarantee Options UGOs, which constitute more than 95% of the remaining GMAB policies.
Products sold with a Capital Guarantee Option CGO GMAB, a product predecessor to the UGO, hold less onerous guarantees and do not give rise to significant risk.
The GMAB UGOs guarantee policyholders a return of 120% of invested premiums and, subject to policyholder election, also a Highest Anniversary Value HAV guarantee.
These guarantees are effective on the 10-year anniversary of policies, which will be reached in 2017 and 2018.
The risk attached to the guarantee of 120% of invested premium, and relating to equity and foreign exchange downside risks, is managed by an existing suite of hedging programmes dynamic tail hedging strategy, structured look-back options, and forward start options which continue to effectively manage the potential downside associated with the 120% Capital Return Guarantee and the HAV features for the GMAB policy obligations.
As with the approach leading up to the 5-year anniversaries, we expect that as the 10-year anniversaries of these GMAB policies approach the business will adapt the suite of hedging programmes so that it efficiently manages market exposure from GMAB guarantee top-up payments in 2017 and 2018.
GMAB reserves have increased from $82 million at 31 December 2014 to $125 million at 31 December 2015, an increase of $43 million, mainly due to unfavourable equity and foreign exchange performances on average across all economies in 2015 compared to 2014.
If the Group were to stress the underlying assets and liabilities, by adding 10% to the current level of volatility, it would increase the underlying assets by 7 million and increase the value of the liability by 8 million, which would result in a net loss for the Group of 1 million.

Investment contract policyholders have the option to terminate or transfer their contracts at any time and to receive the surrender or transfer value of their policies.
Although these liabilities are payable on demand, and are therefore included in the contractual maturity analysis as due in less than three months and more than three months less than one year, the Group does not expect all these amounts to be paid out within one year of the reporting date.
The undiscounted cash flows of discretionary participating investment contracts only include amount vested or to be vested, while their carrying amount includes reserves that are payable at the discretion of the Group.

The effect of a change in assumption is mitigated by the offset partial or full to the bonus stabilisation reserve in the case of smoothed bonus products in South Africa.
The tables below demonstrate the effect of a change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain unchanged: At 31 December 2015 % m m m Emerging Old Mutual Change Markets Wealth Bermuda Assumption Mortality and morbidity rates assurance 10 212 2 Mortality rates annuities 10 38 Discontinuance rates 10 1 1 1 Expenses maintenance 10 47 3 At 31 December 2014 % m m m Emerging Old Mutual Change Markets Wealth Bermuda Assumption Mortality and morbidity rates assurance 10 271 2 Mortality rates annuities 10 44 Discontinuance rates 10 7 1 1 Expenses maintenance 10 54 3 Emerging Markets The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
The insurance contract liabilities recorded for the Emerging Market business are also impacted by the valuation discount rate assumed.
Lowering this rate by 1% with a corresponding reduction in the valuation inflation rate assumption would result in no impact on insurance contract liabilities or net profit 2014: 2 million.
This impact is calculated with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
There is no impact in 2015 due to further management actions taken to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on operating profit.
It should be noted that where the assets and liabilities of a product are closely matched e. g. non-profit annuity business or where the impact of a lower valuation discount rate is hedged or partially hedged, the net effect has been shown since the asset movement fully or partially offsets the liability movement.
Old Mutual Wealth The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated independently using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in premiums paid by policyholders.
The assumption changes have no impact on the linked UK business.
Whole of Life is the main product group affected by the lapse assumption change.
This is because the policies have the longest duration and represent close to 93% of the reserve.
The main product groups impacted by the expense, mortality and morbidity sensitivities are Whole of Life and Accelerated Critical Illness.
In the Old Mutual Wealth business, non-linked liabilities are well matched by gilts so that the net impact of a valuation interest rate change taking asset and liability movement into account is negligible.
Old Mutual Bermuda Post the sale of Old Mutual Bermuda Limited OMB, the Group no longer owns any underlying policies or manages policyholder funds.
The Group continues to provide re insurance coverage to Beechwood Bermuda Ltd in connection with the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit GMAB guarantees.
Lapses and partial withdrawals have the largest impact where increased activity reduces the guarantee portion of the business since less living benefit exposure is expected in the future.
Mortality plays a much smaller part in Bermuda since the business is minimum guaranteed accumulation benefit.
Increased deaths likewise reduce future guarantees: however the effect is negligible due to the short-term nature of the benefit.
h Sensitivity analysis property & casualty An increase of 10% in the average cost of claims would require the recognition of an additional loss after tax of 19 million 2014: 27 million net of reinsurance.
Similarly, an increase of 10% in the ultimate number of claims would result in an additional loss of 19 million 2014: 27 million net of reinsurance.
The majority of the Groups property & casualty contracts are classified as short-tailed, meaning that any claim is settled within a year after the loss date.
This contrasts with the long-tailed classes where the claims cost take longer to materialise and settle.
The Groups property & casualty long-tailed business is generally limited to accident, third-party motor, liability and some engineering classes.
In total the long-tail business comprises less than five per cent of an average years claim costs.
i Reinsurance assets credit risk None of the Groups reinsurance assets are either past due or impaired.
Of the reinsurance assets shown in the statement of financial position all are considered investment grade with the exception of 179 million of unrated exposures 2014: 189 million.
Collateral is not taken against reinsurance assets or deposits held with reinsurers other than in limited circumstances.
