Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

TRADE AND OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses.
We do not consider the fair values of trade and other receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values.
Credit terms for customers are determined in individual territories.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets.
Balances are considered for impairment on an individual basis rather than by reference to the extent that they become overdue.
