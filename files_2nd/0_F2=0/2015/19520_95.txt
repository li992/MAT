Deferred taxation continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
The deferred tax asset arises due to timing differences in Latin America, Africa and Europe.
Given both recent and forecast trading, the directors areof the opinion that the level of profits in the foreseeable future is more likely than not to be sufficient to recover these assets.
Deferred tax liabilities of US$2,013 million 2014: US$3,174 million are expected to fall due after more than one year and deferred tax assets ofUS$115 million 2014: US$112 million are expected to be recovered after more than one year.
2015 2014 US$m US$m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: Tax losses 281 355 Tax credits 1,355 1,532 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 7 19 Share-based payments 47 28 Other deductible temporary differences 120 1,690 2,054 Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are not recognised unless there is convincing evidence that existing taxable temporary differences will reverse in the future or there will be sufficient taxable profits in future years to recover the assets.
A significant part of the tax losses arise in the UK and the value has been calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 20%.
The tax losses do not expire.
Deferred tax assets in respect of tax credits arising which are carried forward for offset against future profits are not recognised unless it is probable that future profits will arise.
US$1,345 million 2014: US$$1,180 million of these tax credits expire within 10 years.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where there is an intention to distribute those reserves.
A deferred tax liability of US$11 million 2014: US$14 million has been recognised.
A deferred tax liability of US$56 million 2014: US$97 million has been recognised in respect of unremitted profits of associates where a dividend policy is not in place.
Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operating in lower tax jurisdictions do not result in a deferred tax liability where the reporting entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Similarly no tax is provided where there are plans to remit overseas earnings of subsidiaries but it is not expected that such distributions will give rise to a tax liability.
As a result of UK legislation which largely exempts overseas dividends from tax, the temporary differences arising on unremitted profits are unlikely tolead to additional corporate taxes.
However, remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
