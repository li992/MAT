Other information Analysis of investments Analysis of investments Analysis of investments We invest our policyholders funds and our own funds in order to generate a return for both policyholders and shareholders.
The financial strength of the Group and both our current and future operating results and financial performance are, therefore, in part dependent on the quality and performance of our investment portfolios in the UK, Europe, North America and Asia.
For additional information on our financial investments, see IFRS Financial statements Note 26 Financial investments.
Investment strategy Our investment portfolio supports a range of businesses operating in a number of geographical locations.
Our aim is to match the investments held to support a line of business to the nature of the underlying liabilities, whilst at the same time considering local regulatory requirements, the level of risk inherent within different investments, and the desire to generate superior investment returns, where compatible with this stated strategy and risk appetite.
Long-term insurance and savings business As stated above, we aim to optimise investment returns whilst ensuring that sufficient assets are held to meet future liabilities and regulatory requirements.
As different types of life insurance business vary in their cash flows and in the expectations placed upon them by policyholders, we need to hold different types of investments to meet these different cash flows and expectations.
The UK with-profits business is comprised largely of long-term contracts with some guaranteed payments.
We are therefore able to invest a significant proportion of the funds supporting this business in equities and real estate.
This is because the longterm nature of these contracts allows us to take advantage of the long-term growth potential within these classes of assets, whilst the level of guaranteed payments is managed to mitigate the level of risk that we bear in relation to the volatility of these classes of assets.
Non-UK participating business, annuities and non-participating contracts in all countries, have a high level of guaranteed future payments.
We endeavour to match the investments held against these types of business to future cash flows.
We therefore have a policy of generally holding fixed income securities and mortgage loans with appropriate maturity dates.
With unit-linked business, the primary objective is to maximise investment returns, subject to following an investment policy consistent with the representations that we have made to our unit-linked product policyholders.
General insurance and health business The general insurance and health business is comprised of shorter-term liabilities than the long-term insurance business.
Furthermore, all the risk attaching to the investments is borne by our shareholders.
As a result, the investment portfolio held to cover general insurance liabilities contains a higher proportion of fixed income securities than the portfolio held to cover life insurance liabilities.
Property partnerships As part of their investment strategy, the UK and certain European policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships PLPs, either directly or via property unit trusts PLPs, through a mix of capital and loans.
The nature of our involvement in property partnerships is set out in the second and third paragraphs of the Investment vehicles section of IFRS Financial Statements Accounting policies D Consolidation principles.
Property partnerships are accounted for as subsidiaries, joint ventures or financial investments depending on our participation and the terms of each partnership agreement.
For each property partnership accounted for as a subsidiary, joint venture or financial investment, we are exposed to falls in the value of the underlying properties which are reflected as unrealised gains losses on investment properties, our share of joint venture results and unrealised gains losses on financial investments, respectively.
However, the majority of these are in policyholder funds rather than shareholder funds so such losses are offset by changes in the amounts due to policyholders or unitholders, or UDS.
Analysis of investments We distinguish between policyholder, participating fund and shareholder investments, which are terms used to reflect the differing exposure to investment gains and losses.
Policyholder assets are connected to our unit-linked business, where the policyholder bears the investment risk on the assets in the unit-linked funds.
Our exposure to loss on policyholder assets is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the funds.
Participating fund assets relate to some of our insurance and investment contracts which contain a discretionary participation feature, which is a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
Our exposure to investment losses on participating funds is generally limited to our participation in the fund.
Shareholder assets are other assets held within our businesses that are not backing unit-linked liabilities or participating funds.

The apportionment of our shareholder assets is predominantly weighted towards debt securities and loans.
In comparison, policyholder assets contain a greater proportion of equities and other investments e. g. unit trusts, and participating funds contain a greater proportion of debt and equity securities, reflecting the underlying investment mandates.
We carry investments on our statement of financial position at either fair value or amortised cost.
At 31 December 2015, approximately 99% of the Groups total investments were carried at fair value on the statement of financial position.
For more information about financial investments analysed according to their accounting classification and valuation approach, as well as the cost, unrealised gains and losses, impairments, fair value and other information concerning financial investments, see IFRS Financial statements Note 26 Financial investments.
Debt securities Participating fund asset and shareholder debt securities analysed by credit rating and sector Participating fund asset and shareholder debt securities analysed by credit rating and product type as at 31 December 2015 are set out in the tables below.
Government and corporate debt securities are further analysed by type of issuer.
The credit rating used for each individual security is the median rating of the available ratings from the major credit rating agencies.
If a credit rating is available from only one of these rating agencies then this rating is used.
If an individual security has not been given a credit rating by any of the major rating agencies, the security is classified as non-rated.
For the table above we have expressed our rating using a rating scale whereby investment grade debt securities are classified within the range of AAA extremely strong to BBB good ratings, with AAA being the highest possible rating.
Debt securities which fall outside this range are classified as less than BBB.
This rating scale is analogous with that used by major rating agencies.
At 31 December 2015, the proportion of our shareholder debt securities that are investment grade increased to 92.9% 2014: 91.3%.
The remaining 7.1% of shareholder debt securities that do not have an external rating of BBB or higher can be split as follows: 1.4% are debt securities that are rated as below investment grade: and 5.7% are not rated by the major rating agencies.
Of the securities not rated by an external agency most are allocated an internal rating using a methodology largely consistent with that adopted by an external rating agency, and are considered to be of investment grade credit quality: these include 2.5 billion 2014: 2.5 billion of debt securities held in our UK Life business, predominantly made up of private placements and other corporate bonds, which have been internally rated as investment grade.
Total wrapped credit In respect of the wrapped credit investments, the table below shows the credit rating of the securities as they are officially rated, and an estimate of their rating without the guarantee.
As rating agencies do not provide credit ratings for individual wrapped credit securities without consideration of the insurance guarantee, the credit ratings disclosed in the table below are based on internal best estimates.

All of these assets are valued on a mark to market basis under IAS 39, and therefore our statement of financial position and income statement already reflect any change in value between the date of purchase and the balance sheet date.
The significant majority of these holdings are within our participating funds where the risk to our shareholders is governed by the nature and extent of our participation within those funds.
