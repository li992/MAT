The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued o Payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for securities purchased for future settlement, accruals and deferred income that have been acquired incurred in the ordinary course of business.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of business if longer.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
p Policy on operating segments Under IFRS 8, operating segments are considered to be the components of an entity, about which separate financial information is available, that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker Henderson, with oversight from the Board in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Directors meet regularly to consider investment strategy and to monitor the Companys performance.
The Fund Manager, who has been appointed to manage the Companys investments, attends all Board meetings at which investment strategy and performance are discussed.
The Directors consider that the Company has one operating segment, which invests in shares and securities primarily for capital appreciation and dividend growth in accordance with the Companys published investment objectives.
The business is not managed on a geographical basis.
However, for the convenience of investors, disclosure by geographical segment has been provided in note 3 and in the Fund Manager Report on pages 10 to 21.
Further analyses of expenses, investment gains or losses, profit and other assets and liabilities by country have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way or the results are not considered to be significant.
