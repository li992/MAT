Financial risk management objectives and policies The Companys principal financial assets comprise investments in subsidiary undertakings and cash.
The main purpose of these financial assets is to finance the subsidiaries operations.
The Company has various other financial assets and liabilities such as debtors and creditors.
The main risks arising are interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks that are summarised overleaf.
a Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Company is as follows: 31 August 31 August 2015 2014 Fixed rate assets m m Investments in subsidiary undertakings 110.8 82.0 31 August 31 August 2015 2014 Variable rate assets m m Cash at bank 67.1 39.3 The weighted average interest rate of the equity loans included within investments in subsidiary undertakings and cash at bank is 1.5% and LIBOR respectively.

31 August 31 August 2015 2014 m m Assets 33.8 29.7 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the exchange rate, with all variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax due to changes in value of loans from to subsidiary undertakings and interest streams: Increase Effect on profit decrease in before tax exchange rate m 2015 5% 0.6 5% 0.6 2014 5% 0.5 5% 0.5 The exchange rate as at 31 August 2015 was 1.369 2014: 1.261.

Annual Report 2015 | 111 Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued for the year ended 31 August 2015 c Credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at period end was: 31 August 31 August 2015 2014 m m Investments 271.4 252.4 Cash at bank 67.1 39.3 Debtors 271.3 160.9 Total 609.8 452.6 A provision of 157.1 million 2014: 236.3 million is in place against the carrying value of the shares and loans to subsidiaries undertakings to write down their carrying value to their estimated recoverable amount of 271.4 million 2014: 252.4 million.
As at 31 August 2015 no provision was required against the carrying value of the intercompany debtors 2014: 25.5 million to write down their carrying value to their estimated recoverable amount of 249.3 million 2014: 156.9 million With respect to credit risk arising from cash at bank, the majority of the counterparties are investment grade or above.
d Liquidity risk The table below represents the maturity profile of contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Company can be requiredto pay: Amounts due to subsidiaries Trade and undertakings other payables At 31 August 2015 m m In one year or less 3.5 In more than one year, but not more than two years In more than two years, but not more than three years 15.6 Total contractual cash flows 15.6 3.5 Carrying amount 15.6 3.5 Amounts due to subsidiaries Trade and undertakings other payables At 31 August 2014 m m In one year or less 1.9 In more than one year, but not more than two years In more than two years, but not more than three years 13.0 Total contractual cash flows 13.0 1.9 Carrying amount 13.0 1.9 e Fair value Due to the short maturities of cash at bank, debtors and creditors, the fair value approximates carrying value.
Commitments and contingencies The Company has provided certain subsidiary entities with a commitment to provide financial support for a stated period should the need arise.
Contingent consideration linked to potential uplift in property values following redevelopment may become payable in respect of the CMC acquisition, specifically the acquisition of the Ingolstadt and Hamburg properties.
This is payable within three years of the completion date if certain conditions are met.
Based on the facts as at 31August 2015 the outflow of economic benefits is not probable and so no provision has been set up for any potential future outflow.
Subsequent events On 7 September 2015 the Company, through its whollyowned subsidiary Redefine AUK Limited, exchanged contracts to acquire the AUK Portfolio of 20 investment properties for 490 million, excluding transaction costs.
Due to the nature and size of the transaction shareholder approval was sought and was received at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 25 September 2015.
The acquisition was planned to complete in three phases, the first consisting of one property valued at 52.5 million which did not require shareholder approval completed on 7 September.
The second consisting of nine properties with a combined value of 203.5 million completed on 2 October 2015.
The final ten properties with a combined value of 233.7 million are due to complete in March 2016.
The portfolio consists primarily of offices and retail parks and all properties are located in the United Kingdom.
