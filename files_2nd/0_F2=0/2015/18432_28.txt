Essentra calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the applicable corporate income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
2015 2014 m m Profit before income tax 90.4 99.7 1 Tax at weighted average tax rate 2015: 20.9%: 2014: 22.0% 18.9 21.9 Effects of: 2 Permanent disallowable items including exceptional costs 2.1 1.4 3 Non-taxable exceptional items 1.4 Overseas state and local tax 1.2 0.8 4 Unrecognised tax attributes arising utilised 0.2 3.6 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2.3 0.4 5 Withholding tax on unremitted earnings 3.0 6 Change in tax rates 0.9 7 Other items 1.3 0.2 Income tax expense 21.7 27.9 Income tax expense in the UK is 0.7m 2014: 4.6m.
This is primarily due to significant exceptional costs incurred in 2015 relating to the UK businesses.
1 The change in the weighted average applicable tax rate is caused by a change in the geographical balance of the Groups profits and by changes in corporate tax rates in these geographies 2 The acquisition of Clondalkin led to significant restructuring activities in the year.
Accordingly, permanent disallowable items may vary in future years.
3 See note 2 and analysis of other exceptional operating items.
Income from the release of warranty obligation in relation to the disposal of Globalpack and an adjustment for contingent deferred consideration in relation to prior acquisitions are included at the UK rate of 20.25% 4 See further information regarding deferred tax asset recognition in note 15 5 Essentra is able to control the timing and amount of remitted earnings, and therefore this amount may vary in future years 6 The UK corporate tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% on 1 April 2015, and further reductions to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 have been enacted during 2015.
The impact of these enacted changes on deferred tax for the UK is 0.6m.

The weighted average useful economic lives of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year were 14.2 years and 10.6 years 2014: 15.0 years and 10.7 years respectively.
Essentra tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
A discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units as appropriate.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units, being the operating segments, as follows: Goodwill 2015 2014 Operating segment m m Distribution 89.5 87.9 Health & Personal Care Packaging 243.8 90.4 Specialist Technologies 33.9 33.5 367.2 211.8 Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are allocated to the businesses to which they relate as shown below: Customer relationships and other intangible assets 2015 2014 Business Operating segment m m Components Businesses of former Moss and Skiffy Distribution 12.6 14.2 Components Businesses of former Richco Distribution 32.8 33.9 Components Business of former Reid Supply Distribution 7.6 8.3 Components Business of former Mesan Distribution 13.1 16.9 Components Abric Distribution 10.9 10.4 Healthcare Clondalkin Health & Personal Care Packaging 147.2 Porous St. Charles Specialist Technologies 4.0 4.8 Porous Chicopee Specialist Technologies 13.4 13.8 Packaging Health & Personal Care Packaging 2.7 3.2 Speciality Tapes Distribution 12.7 13.4 Healthcare Health & Personal Care Packaging 61.1 69.1 Multiple businesses Multiple segments 6.3 6.6 324.4 194.6 The goodwill impairment tests are based on the following assumptions: Cash flows for the next two years are based upon the Groups annual Plan.
The key assumptions in the cash flow projections for the Groups annual Plan are the revenue growth and operating margin for each division.
Operating margin is primarily based on the levels achieved in 2015, which are disclosed in note 1, adjusted by targets set for revenue expansion and cost control and reduction for each individual division within the Plan period Cash flows beyond the Plan period are based on year twos Plan cash flows with growth rates specific to each business which range from nil to 2% 2014: nil to 3% The estimated cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon Essentras estimated post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.3% 2014: 9.3% adjusted for the risk applicable to each operating segment.
The pre-tax discount rates applied for each group of cash generating units to which significant goodwill is allocated are as follows: 16.2% for Distribution, 11.4% for Health & Personal Care Packaging and 12.7% for Specialist Technologies 2014: 16.7% for Component & Protection Solutions, 13.1% for Porous Technologies, 11.7% for Packaging & Securing Solutions and 11.7% for Other Any impairment losses identified as a result of the analysis are recognised in profit or loss.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved reducing future cash flows by up to 40%, reducing terminal growth rates by up to 2 percentage points or increasing discount rates by up to 80 basis points.
The results of these analyses showed that, despite significantly lower post-tax operating cash flows or increased pre-tax discount rates, the value in use of goodwill and other intangible assets continued to exceed their carrying value.

Derivatives continued Fair value derivatives protect the Group from currency risk exposure from changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a previously unrecognised firm commitment to buy or sell assets at a fixed price.
Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows.
Of the balance at 31 December 2014, 2.9m relates to a cash flow hedge on the consideration for the acquisition of Clondalkin SPD, which completed on 30 January 2015 see note 23.
The other cash flow hedges relate to usual trading transactions in foreign currencies.
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in foreign operations.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur.
All of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next 15 months and all derivative instruments mature within the next 15 months.
Essentra had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings.
The exchange gains of 13.7m 2014: losses of 6.2m on the US dollar borrowings and the losses of 7.7m 2014: gains of 3.9m on the euro borrowings were recognised in other comprehensive income.
Finance income and expense arising on financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are those amounts, excluding interest on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities, detailed in note 3.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: 2015 2014 Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net m m m m m m 1 Property, plant and equipment 2.2 17.1 14.9 2.7 16.2 13.5 2 Intangible assets 83.3 83.3 0.5 42.1 41.6 3 Employee benefits 10.9 5.3 5.6 13.6 4.6 9.0 4 Other 8.1 3.9 4.2 10.8 7.6 3.2 Tax assets liabilities 21.2 109.6 88.4 27.6 70.5 42.9 Set off of tax 16.6 16.6 15.8 15.8 Net tax assets liabilities 4.6 93.0 88.4 11.8 54.7 42.9 1 A deferred tax liability arises on property, plant and equipment as the tax value of assets is lower than the corresponding accounting value.
This arises as tax deductions are determined by the applicable tax laws in each country the Group operates in whereas accounting depreciation is calculated in line with the Groups accounting policy 2 A deferred tax liability is provided on temporary differences arising on the Groups intangible assets as in the majority of cases the local tax authorities do not allow deduction for the amortisation of these intangible assets.
The increase during the year is due to the acquisition of the Clondalkin SPD business see note 23 3 This represents deferred tax on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and share-based incentives 4 This includes expenditure that will be deductible in future periods for tax purposes when the amounts are settled in cash, and withholding tax on overseas earnings from group companies expected to be remitted in the foreseeable future of 3.0m 2014: nil 109 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 | WWW.

At the year end it is expected that earnings from certain overseas group companies will be remitted and a deferred tax liability of 3.0m 2014: nil has been recognised accordingly.
This represents withholding taxes payable on the remittance of these earnings under local tax laws.
The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 102.0m as at 31 December 2015 2014: 94.8m, and the associated amount of unrecognised deferred tax is 13.9m 2014: 9.1m.
Based on available information, management determined whether it is probable for some or all of the deferred tax assets to be realised.
In determining this, management considered the cumulative losses in prior years, the history of tax losses, the manner in which assets can be used including time limitations under local laws, future earnings potential and expectation of future reversal of taxable temporary differences.
Following management assessment, deferred tax assets of 0.2m 2014: 0.2m in respect of capital losses and unutilised tax losses of 30.9m 2014: 30.9m have not been recognised where their realisation is not considered probable.
The capital losses have an unlimited expiry date.
The tax losses expire as follows: nil within five years, 4.5m in five to ten years, 10.5m in over ten years and 15.9m with no expiry.
If future conditions change the amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets will be reassessed.
This may impact the income tax expense credit in that year.

Other provisions relate primarily to vacant properties, lease dilapidations, employees compensation claims, other claims, environmental liabilities and product warranties.
Non-current provisions are generally long-term in nature with uncertain timing of utilisation.
The release of other provisions during the year relates mostly to claims, property related provisions and warranty liabilities.
Employee benefits Post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The Group also has a number of other post-employment obligations in certain countries, some of which are required under local law.
The defined benefit plans are administered by boards of trustees and the assets are held independently from Essentra.
The boards of trustees comprise member nominated trustees, employer nominated trustees and independent advisory trustees.
The articles of the plans prohibit a majority on the boards to be established by either the member or employer nominated trustees.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2015 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recently completed actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
The principal European defined benefit schemes entitle remaining members to a pension calculated on 1.25% or 2% of their capped final pensionable pay multiplied by the number of pensionable years of service.
Some members have historical entitlements to accrual rates of 1.67%-1.9% and 3% for certain tranches of their service.
The principal US defined benefit schemes entitle certain participating employees to annuity benefits equal to 50% of final average pensionable salary, reduced for years of service less than 30, and other participating employees to annuity benefits equal to $49 per month for each year of service.

During 2014, an offer to settle the pension obligations was made by the US board of trustees to deferred members of the US pension schemes, and a settlement gain was recognised in profit or loss relating to those members who accepted the offer.
Following the closure of the Groups principal defined benefit pension schemes to future accruals, the schemes are funded by the Groups subsidiaries and employees are not required to make any further contribution.
The funding of these schemes is based on separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from those used in the valuation for IAS 19 purposes.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were: 2015 2014 Europe US Europe US 1 Increase in salaries pre-2010 n a 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 1 Increase in salaries post-2010 n a 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 1 Increase in pensions at RPI capped at 5% 3.10% n a 3.00% n a at CPI capped at 5% 2.20% n a 2.10% n a at CPI minimum 3%, capped at 5% 3.30% n a 3.20% n a at CPI capped at 2.5% 1.80% n a 1.70% n a Discount rate 3.80% 4.37% 3.70% 4.00% Inflation rate 2.70% n a 2.60% n a 1 For service prior to April 2010, pension at retirement is linked to salary at retirement.
For service after April 2010, pension is linked to salary at April 2010 with annual increases capped at 3% Due to the timescale covered, the assumptions applied may not be borne out in practice.

Employee benefits continued The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate defined benefit obligations at the year end are: 2015 2014 Europe US Europe US Male retiring today at age 65 22.4 21.2 22.4 21.6 Female retiring today at age 65 24.8 23.2 24.7 23.8 Male retiring in 20 years at age 65 24.3 22.9 24.3 23.3 Female retiring in 20 years at age 65 26.7 24.9 26.6 25.5 The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustees investment policies.
The allocation of assets is arrived at taking into consideration current market conditions and trends, the size of potential returns relative to investment risk and the extent to which asset realisation needs to match liability maturity.
There are risks underlying these considerations.
If asset returns fall below the returns required for scheme assets to match the present value of scheme liabilities, a scheme deficit results.
Persistent deficits represent an obligation the Group has to settle through increased cash contributions.
If asset maturities are not properly matched with liability maturities, there is also the risk that the Group could be required to make unplanned short-term cash contributions to resolve resulting liquidity issues.
Scheme assets are invested by the trustees in asset classes and markets that are considered to be reasonably liquid, so this matching and liquidity risk is considered to be sufficiently mitigated.
The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the pension scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are therefore inherently uncertain, are: 2015 Europe US Total m m m Equities 32% 63.4 63% 30.3 93.7 Corporate bonds 18% 35.6 36% 17.6 53.2 Government bonds 50% 99.0 99.0 Other 0% 0.5 1% 0.3 0.8 Fair value of scheme assets 198.5 48.2 246.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 174.6 71.2 245.8 Net retirement benefit assets obligations 23.9 23.0 0.9 2014 Europe US Total m m m Equities 31% 62.6 61% 26.4 89.0 Corporate bonds 18% 35.3 36% 15.4 50.7 Government bonds 51% 103.8 103.8 Other 0% 0.9 3% 1.2 2.1 Fair value of scheme assets 202.6 43.0 245.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 182.5 62.6 245.1 Net retirement benefit assets obligations 20.1 19.6 0.5 The equity, corporate bond and government bond assets are either direct investments or investments made via a managed fund for those asset classes.
All of these assets have a quoted market price in an active market.
The other asset class relates primarily to property and hedge funds, which are valued at their cumulative unit offer price.
No direct investment in property is held.
No plan assets are invested directly in the shares of Essentra plc.
Employee benefits continued The pension surplus in Europe is not restricted as the asset is considered realisable on the basis of the Groups unconditional right to a refund.
The average expected duration of the Groups European defined benefit pension liability at 31 December 2015 is 20 years 2014: 20 years.
The average expected duration of the Groups US defined benefit pension liability at 31 December 2015 is 12.9 years 2014: 13.3 years.
The Groups contributions to its defined benefit pension schemes are determined in consultation with trustees, taking into consideration actuarial advice, investment conditions and other local conditions and practices.
In 2016, the Group expects to make defined benefit contributions of $3.7m to its US schemes.
Contributions to its European schemes are being determined.

Financial risk management Essentras activities expose the business to a number of key financial risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Essentras system of internal control and financial risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system.
Such a system can only be designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Essentra has a centralised treasury function to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
Essentra uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury function is subject to periodic independent reviews by the Group Assurance department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Treasury Committee.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographical presence, expertise and suitable credit rating.
The following describes Essentras financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Essentra has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.
The following is an overview of how Essentra manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables Essentras exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers.
This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, including the industry and country in which customers operate.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of business.
Essentra monitors significant customers credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective allowance takes account of historical experience and the profile of customers.
As at 31 December 2015, gross trade receivables were 229.2m 2014: 151.8m of which 43.7m 2014: 25.1m were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Up to three months 39.5 25.1 Over three months 4.2 43.7 25.1 As at 31 December 2015, trade receivables of 4.3m 2014: 6.3m were provided for as they were considered to be impaired.
The ageing of the impaired receivables provided for is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Up to three months 1.6 Over three months 4.3 4.7 4.3 6.3 117 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 | WWW.
Financial risk management continued The movement in the provision for impaired receivables is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Beginning of year 6.3 5.7 Impaired receivables acquired 2.1 0.5 Impairment loss recognised 0.3 2.8 Release in the year 2.9 1.6 Utilisation 1.5 1.1 End of year 4.3 6.3 Derivative assets Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.
The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Essentra monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Essentra by classifying derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.
ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Essentra has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bps, 100bps and 200bps in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Essentra is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
118 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES ANNUAL REPORT 2015 | WWW.
Financial risk management continued a Currency risk Essentra publishes its consolidated Financial Statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore, it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Essentras net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds through measures such as borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
Essentras US dollar denominated assets were approximately 78% 2014: 48% hedged by the US dollar denominated borrowings.
Essentras euro denominated assets were approximately 58% hedged by the euro denominated borrowings.
At 31 December 2014, Essentra did not have any euro denominated borrowings as these were repaid with the proceeds from the share placing during 2014.
Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Essentras transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and therefore transaction exposure is limited.
However, where such exposure does occur, Essentra uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 18 months.
Essentra does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are transferred either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will continue to be 100% effective.

Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk During 2014, Essentras strategy was to ensure with a reasonable degree of certainty that at least 50% of the overall net finance expense is protected against material adverse movements in interest rates using fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps and caps.
With effect from 1 January 2015, Essentra implemented a revised policy, which is to ensure that at least 30% of the total debt with maturities of more than one year is protected with fixed interest rates or approved interest rate derivatives.
The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external floating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Essentras interest rate derivatives.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had no significant floating rate debt and therefore has no significant sensitivity to interest rate movements.
There is no impact on amounts recorded directly in other comprehensive income or equity.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Essentra, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Essentras objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Essentra is mostly funded by two series of US$80m US Private Placement Loan Notes from various financial institutions and syndicated multi-currency five-year revolving credit facilities of 271.0m and 167.5m from its bankers.
The two series of Loan Notes of US$80m have original maturities of six and nine years and the revolving credit facilities mature in July 2019.

All trade and other payables are due to be settled in less than six months.
Financial risk management continued Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out Essentras accounting categories and fair value for each class of financial asset and liability.

Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
These are determined to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The only financial instrument with fair value determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, which is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, is the deferred contingent consideration of 1.5m relating to the acquisition of Mesan Kilit A. S. and Specialty Plastics 2014: 5.8m relating to the acquisition of Mesan Kilit A.
The fair value of the deferred contingent consideration is estimated based on an assessment of the likely outcome of the acquired business financial performance.
There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
During the year, a fair value gain of 4.8m 2014: fair value gain of 0.6m in respect of financial instruments at level 3 fair value hierarchy was recognised within exceptional items see note 2, and nil 2014: nil was settled in cash.
No other fair value gains or losses were recorded in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $160m US Private Placement Loan Notes.
The Loan Notes are held at amortised cost with a carrying value of 108.3m 2014: 101.9m.
The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan Notes at 31 December 2015 is 117.4m 2014: 111.3m.
All other financial assets, classified as loans and receivables, and trade and other payables, classified as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
Unsecured bank loans, included within interest bearing loans and borrowings, incur interest at floating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate their fair values at the reporting date.

Essentra sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Essentra manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Essentra may return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Essentra monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items.
Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees.
During 2015, Essentras strategy, which was unchanged from 2014, was to maintain the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 31 December 2014 was low due to the inclusion of proceeds from the issue of 23,659,761 shares during 2014, to fund the acquisition of Clondalkin SPD which was completed on 30 January 2015.
The net debt-to-EBITDA ratios at 31 December were: 2015 2014 Note m m Net debt excluding prepaid facility fees 375.8 64.7 Operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items 171.5 142.5 Plus depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment 7 31.9 27.2 Plus share option expense 17 5.7 6.8 EBITDA 209.1 176.5 Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.80 0.37 19.

Issued share capital continued In 2014, to fund the acquisition of Clondalkin Essentra plc issued a total of 23,659,761 new ordinary shares of 25p each at a price of 713.5p per share, raising gross proceeds of 168.8m.
Issue costs of 1.2m were incurred.
The excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of shares issued is recorded in a merger relief reserve in accordance with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
As at 31 December 2014, the proceeds from the placing were used to repay the amounts drawn under the revolving credit facilities.
Reserves Within retained earnings the Company has deducted the value of own shares purchased for an employee trust and treasury shares held by the Company with a total cost of 19.0m 2014: 34.7m.
Employee trust shares are ordinary shares of the Company held in an employee benefit trust.
The purpose of this trust is to hold shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to Executive Directors and employees relating to deferred share awards and options granted under the Companys share-based incentive plans.
Full details are set out in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 62 to 78.
The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in these Financial Statements.
At 31 December 2015 the trust held 1,828,789 2014: 3,379,383 shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of 0.5m 2014: 0.8m and market value of 15.1m 2014: 24.7m.
The Company holds 1,750,571 2014: 3,449,685 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 0.4m 2014: 0.9m in treasury.
This represents 0.7% 2014: 1.3% of the number of ordinary shares in issue.
The other reserve relates to the Group reorganisation, which took place as part of the demerger from Bunzl plc.
It represents the difference between Essentra plcs share capital and Essentra International Limiteds share capital and share premium on 6 June 2005 and is not distributable.

Acquisitions 2015 acquisition: Clondalkin On 30 January 2015, Essentra acquired the entire Specialist Packaging Division of Clondalkin Group Clondalkin SPD from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus.
Clondalkin SPD is a global provider of speciality secondary packaging solutions for the pharmaceutical and health & personal care industries.
With 24 facilities in North America and Europe, the acquisition of Clondalkin SPD significantly enhances Essentras existing geographic presence in healthcare packaging and, through leveraging the combined footprint of both businesses, will allow the Group to further exploit both existing, and attractive new growth opportunities.
Clondalkin SPDs product portfolio of folding carton, product literature and labels is complementary to the Groups current packaging and authentication capabilities, therefore broadening the range and innovation offered to customers.
A summary of the acquisition of Clondalkin SPD is detailed below: Fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed m Customer relationships and order book 160.7 Goodwill 158.1 Property, plant and equipment 35.6 Inventories 20.8 Receivables 36.4 Cash and cash equivalents 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations 4.9 Deferred tax 43.6 Current Tax 0.5 Payables 57.0 Provisions 4.6 Fair value of net assets acquired 308.2 Satisfied by: Cash consideration paid 308.2 Cash consideration 308.2 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 7.2 Net cash flow in respect of the acquisition 301.0 Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories, receivables and payables were all reassessed to their fair value.
The gross contractual amount receivable of the receivables was 38.5m.
Acquisitions continued Goodwill represents the expected operating synergies and financial synergies, and the value of an assembled workforce.
Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax effect of recognising customer relationships and other intangible assets and the tax effect of the fair value adjustments.
Clondalkin SPD contributed 228.5m to revenue and 27.1m to operating profit before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2015.
Had the acquisition been completed on 1 January 2015, the Groups revenue and operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items would have been 1,118.8m and 171.7m respectively.
2015 acquisition: Specialty Plastics The Group also acquired Specialty Plastics based in Australia in February 2015.
This acquisition was not material.
Relevant previous acquisitions During 2015, Essentra reassessed the fair value adjustments made in respect of the major operating subsidiaries of Abric Berhad Abric which was acquired on 16 December 2014, and made changes to certain accruals, property, plant and equipment, customer relationship intangible assets and deferred tax assets.
The impact on goodwill is an increase of 0.9m.
Transactions with related parties During 2014, the Filters business in Jordan was disposed of to the minority shareholder who was also a director of the business, for a consideration of US$50,000.
A loss on disposal of 0.4m arose from the transaction.
Other than this transaction and the compensation of key management note 5, Essentra has not entered into any material transactions with related parties during 2014 and 2015.
