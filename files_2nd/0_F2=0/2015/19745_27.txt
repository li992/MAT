Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2015 2014 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.10% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.00% 2.00% Discount rate 3.80% 3.65% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.00% Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows: 2015 2014 Retiring today: Males 87.6 87.5 Females 90.1 90.0 Retiring in 20 years: Males 89.4 89.3 Females 92.1 92.0 Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 1% Decrease increase by 54 million Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 12 million The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
The movements in the net liability arising from defined benefit obligation over the year is as follows: 2015 2014 Present Present value of Net liability value of Net liability funded arising from funded arising from defined Fair value defined defined Fair value defined benefit of scheme benefit benefit of scheme benefit obligation assets obligation obligation assets obligation m m m m m m At 1 January 361.0 277.2 83.8 315.9 255.6 60.3 Current service cost 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.5 Interest expense income 13.0 10.2 2.8 14.4 11.6 2.8 Amounts recognised in income in respect ofdefined benefit schemes 13.6 10.2 3.4 14.9 11.6 3.3 Remeasurement: Return on plan assets excluding amounts includedin interest expense income 5.7 5.7 13.0 13.0 Gains losses from changes in financialassumptions 5.0 5.0 42.4 42.4 Amounts recognised in the statement ofcomprehensive income 5.0 5.7 0.7 42.4 13.0 29.4 Contributions: Employers 0.6 10.2 10.8 0.5 8.7 9.2 Payments from plans Benefit payments 12.5 12.5 11.7 11.7 At 31 December 356.5 279.4 77.1 361.0 277.2 83.8 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 109
