Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 83 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 March 2015 1.
Principal Accounting Policies RPC Group Plc the Company is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
Both the Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of these approved financial statements.
The following principal accounting policies apply to both the Group and Company financial statements.
They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group and Companys financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements, which are presented in sterling, are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments and contingent consideration which are stated at their fair value.
In preparing the consolidated set of financial statements, the Consolidated income statement has been restated to reflect the split between Adjusted and Nonunderlying categories.
This change was made to better reflect the adjusted performance of the Group and improve the clarity of the reporting.
The geographical segment analysis has also been restated to reflect the Rest of World segment, previously included within Mainland Europe, due to increased global presence.
The change was made to better reflect the regions in which the Group operates.
Key Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of the financial statements requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key estimates and judgements used in the financial statements are as follows: Impairment of tangible and intangible assets Intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment and the Groups tangible assets other than inventories, financial assets within the scope of International Accounting Standard IAS 39 and deferred tax assets, are tested when there is an indication of impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out below and in note 12 to the financial statements.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash flow projections for each cash-generating unit and discount rates based on a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assumptions of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit CGU.
Business combinations IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the consideration for an acquisition is recorded at fair value.
Where contingent consideration is part of the acquisition cost then management have estimated the fair value of the amount payable.
Contingent consideration is revalued each reporting period according to the latest forecasts of the acquired business based on the terms of the earn-out arrangement.
Where deferred consideration is part of an acquisition cost then it is recorded and held on the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Where payment is dependent on the recipient remaining in employment, the payment will be accounted for as post-acquisition remuneration as required under IFRS 3 and be classified as exceptional remuneration expense over the earn-out period.
This is also held at fair value and revalued each reporting period.
Assets and liabilities must also be recognised at fair value on acquisition.
The identification and measurement of contingent liabilities, out-of-market contracts and intangible assets are key areas of judgement.
For intangible assets appropriate valuation methods are used, including royalty rates and the excess earnings model to recognise the fair value of the assets acquired.
Retirement benefit obligations The costs and present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend upon such factors as life expectancy of the members, wage rate increases of current employees, the returns that the Schemes assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the pension liabilities.
The Group uses estimates based on past experience and actuarial advice in determining these future cash flows and in determining the discount rate.
The accounting policy is set out under Employee Benefits below and details of the assumptions used are set out in note 29 to the financial statements.
Taxation There are many transactions whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group makes provision for anticipated tax consequences based on the likelihood of whether additional taxes may arise.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
If these estimates do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which losses might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax asset or liability will be revised in a future period.
The accounting policy for taxation is set out below.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidation includes the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 March 2015.
Where subsidiaries are acquired during the year, their results are included in the Groups financial statements from the date of control.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Investments joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
84 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 March 2015 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Acquisition Accounting Acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
A systematic approach is taken to identify the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree, and to measure them at fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests, using appropriate valuation methods and third party valuation specialists where appropriate.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
New Standards and Interpretations In the current year there were no new standards adopted that had a material impact on the Group results.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements has been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2014.
This standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements.
The impact led to the adoption of IFRS 11 and 12 as described below.
During the period the Group adopted IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
As a result a joint venture previously proportionally consolidated has now been accounted for under the equity method.
The results for 2014 have been restated for this change.
The impact of this is not material and is disclosed in note 15.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, there were no standards endorsed but not yet adopted by the EU that would have a material impact on the Group results.
Property, Plant and Equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost together with any incidental expenses of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Plant and equipment 5 to 12 years Moulds 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Non-current Assets Disposal Groups Held for Sale Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities, or disposal groups, are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when a sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and management is committed to the sale which is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for resale, the average purchase price is used.
For finished goods, cost is taken as production cost which includes the cost of the raw materials and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Financial Assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to sell the asset, and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 85 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Investments in Subsidiaries Investments are stated at the fair value of the consideration given when initially acquired adjusted for capital contributions in respect of share options granted to employees of its subsidiaries and reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign Currencies Trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling when the transaction was entered into.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the balance sheet.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the balance sheet and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Since converting to IAS and as permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has reported the differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of foreign operations, the effective portion of foreign currency borrowings used in a net investment hedge, and the translation of the results of those companies at the average rate within the translation reserve and has reported the transactions inthe Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Prior to 2005, these items were recognised in retained reserves.
All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Bank Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums paid on settlement or redemption of direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The fair values are determined by reference to the market prices available from the market on which the instruments involved are traded.
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Fair value of Level 2 financial instruments is determined using valuation techniques.
Fair value of Level 3 financial instruments are where inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups treasury policy.
Hedges are classified as follows: Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Cash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Net investment hedges that hedge exposure to changes in the value, due to fluctuations in exchange rates, of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the income statement.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge, as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is recognised in equity, directly in the cash flow hedge reserve or the translation reserve, respectively, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
When the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Where a Group company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements for them as such.
In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
86 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 March 2015 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Revenue Revenue, which excludes value added tax, other sales taxes and trade discounts, represents the invoiced value of goods supplied.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when packaging products and associated equipment are supplied to external customers in line with contractual arrangements.
In these instances, significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to third parties, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Discontinued Operations In the prior financial year the Board approved a plan to dispose of its operations in the Cobelplast cluster, which is consistent with the Groups long-term strategic priority to drive growth and improve returns.
In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the net results for the year are presented within discontinued operations in the Group Income Statement and the assets and liabilities of the businesses were presented separately in the Group Balance Sheet until the sale of the businesses was completed on 30 September 2014.
See note 10 for further details.
Government Grants Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are capitalised and credited to the income statement over the life of the related assets.
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the income statement in the year in which the grant is received.
Exceptional Items Items which are exceptional are presented separately from underlying business performance in the consolidated income statement due to their materiality, nature or infrequency.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps facilitate comparison with prior periods and assess trends in financial performance.
The principal events which may give rise to items include business restructuring and closure costs, including related asset impairments and trading losses during the closure period, business acquisition and integration costs, gains or losses on the disposal businesses and property, goodwill impairments, significant litigation and tax claims, other losses, which, in the management's judgement, could distort an assessment of underlying business performance.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the current taxes payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Employee Benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
The obligation is calculated by external actuaries using the projected unit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity and recognised in full in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The costs of providing accrued service benefits are charged to operating expenses.
Employee benefit net finance expense is included in net financing costs.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
Termination benefits The Group recognises the present value of a liability to pay termination benefits when it has a demonstrable commitment to terminating employment before retirement.
In Germany, the Group has contractual obligations under a part-time employment scheme for older employees Altersteilzeit.
In addition to half salary, the employee may receive a fixed incentive payment.
The Group provides for the incentive payment as a termination benefit.
The number of employees who will take up this arrangement is an estimate based on historical experience and any agreed cap on the number of participants.
Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 87 Other employee benefits The Group provides for the present value of its obligations in respect of other long-term employee benefits using actuarial valuations.
These include deferred salaries due to German Altersteilzeit employees and long service awards.
The Group provides for long service awards as they accrue.
The number of employees who will receive long service awards is estimated based on historical experience.
The costs of short-term employee benefits are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
Leasing Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the income statement, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental charges are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease.
Research and Development Expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Where the expenditure relates to the development of a new product or process which is expected to be technically feasible and commercially viable, development costs are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives, to a maximum of five years.
The intangible assets are assessed for indications of impairment annually and any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill has been recognised on acquisitions and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying amount is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested at least annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and cannot be reversed subsequently.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 which has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement in the year of acquisition.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Patents remaining life of patent Product development costs over the life of the project Computer software and IT systems development costs 4 to 5 years Customer contacts and relationships acquired 5 to 7 years Technology 7 years Brands 10 years The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at acquisition date.
The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase cost and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use.
Computer software costs that are directly associated with the implementation of major business systems are capitalised as intangible assets.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories, financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 and deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses in respect of assets other than goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
88 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 March 2015 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments The Group operates an employee savings related share option scheme and executive share option schemes.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has chosen to adopt IFRS 2 Share-based Payments for share options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
On this basis, the fair value of employee share options granted is calculated at grant date using an appropriate option pricing model.
The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options with a corresponding increase in equity.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its service and non-market estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and the charge to the income statement is adjusted accordingly.
Where the Company grants share options to employees of its subsidiaries, the amount equal to the amount which would otherwise have been charged in the income statement in respect of those options is accounted for as a capital contribution and the Companys cost of investment in its subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Non GAAP measures The Group presents adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share information as it believes these measures provide a helpful indication of its performance and underlying trends.
The term adjusted refers to the relevant measure being reported before exceptional items, the amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets, pension administration expenses and non-underlying finance costs.
These measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis and as a basis for incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The terms adjusted and exceptional items are not defined terms under IFRS and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or be superior to, GAAP measurements of performance.
Related Party Disclosures Transactions between the Group and any related parties which require disclosure under IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures are given in note 30.
Operating Segments The information reported to the Groups Board of Directors, considered to be the Groups chief operating decision maker for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance, is based on manufacturing conversion process.

Intangible Assets continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that acquisition.
The Group tests at least annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The CGUs have been determined at cluster level within the Group, and the carrying value of goodwill at 31 March is allocated as follows: 2015 2014 m m UK Injection Moulding 4.9 4.9 Blow Moulding Bramlage-Wiko 93.3 81.0 Bebo 4.3 5.1 Cobelplast Tedeco-Gizeh Superfos 69.3 78.8 Ace 170.0 Promens 152.2 494.0 169.8 The directors determined that no impairment was required as the recoverable amounts were in excess of the carrying value.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from their value in use.
The cash flow projections used in these calculations cover a three year period based on the 2015 16 budget and the outline plans for 2016 17 and 2017 18 approved by the Board together with terminal values which assume zero growth.
The key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations include: i Sales.
Forecasts are based on cluster level analysis of sales, markets, competitors and prices for the budget period.
Consideration is given to past experience, knowledge of future contracts and expectations of future potential changes in the markets.
ii Polymer and electricity costs.
Forecasts for polymer costs are based on prices at the time the budget is prepared.
Forecasts for electricity costs are based on contractual arrangements taking into account supply and demand factors.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2014: 9% was used to discount the expected cash flows of the cash-generating units.
As each CGU is considered to have similar risks the same discount rate has been applied.
The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, an increase in the discount rate to 15% would be required to indicate a potential impairment in one or more of the CGUs.
Management does not view that an increase of this level is a reasonable possibility.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets include customer contacts with a net book value of 51.3m 2014: 3.9m, brands, being the Saeplast brand acquired with Promens, withanet book value of 2.1m 2014: nil, technology of 8.7m 2014: nil and development costs with a net book value of 9.3m 2014: 6.5m.

Derivative Financial Instruments continued During the year the Group had in place: 10 cross currency interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing interest rate and exchange rate risk on the US private placement USPP notes that were issued in 2011.
10 foreign exchange contracts selling US dollar and purchasing CNY.
These were acquired on the acquisition of Ace Corporation Holdings Limited, had a value of 4.4m on acquisition and were not hedge accounted.
Other smaller foreign exchange contracts used to manage the Groups exposure for foreign currency fluctuations.
Policies and Risks Associated With Derivatives and Financial Instruments The Groups policies and the risks associated with derivatives and financial instruments are as follows: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will affect the Groups net income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within parameters that are deemed to be acceptable, while optimising return.
Generally, the Group seeks to minimise this risk through hedging arrangements designed to manage a proportion of the Groups overall exposure.
The Group does not actively engage in trading of financial assets for speculative purposes.
b Interest Rate Risk The Group has bank borrowings mainly in euros, sterling and US dollars.
Interest rate swaps are used to reduce the exposure of the Group to fluctuations in interest rates which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings at the year end is given in note 20.
An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on borrowings after the effect of interest rate swaps would have reduced profits before tax by approximately 3.2m 2014: 1.4m before accounting for exchange differences.
c Liquidity risk In order to improve liquidity and ensure continuity of funding, the Group has a credit agreement with seven recognised international banks providing a 490m multi-currency revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2019.
During 2011 Group issued $92m and 35m USPP notes expiring in December 2018 and $124m and 25m USPP notes expiring in December 2021.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through additional overdraft facilities.
The following table is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual maturities of financial liabilities including the effect of cross-currency and interest rate swaps.
2015 2014 m m Maturity date Within one year 417.0 306.0 One to two years 73.5 21.6 Two to five years 375.1 73.1 Over five years 135.2 212.7 1,000.8 613.4 d Foreign currency risk Of the Groups net assets, 91.0% 2014: 60.0% before borrowings are in non sterling currencies, mainly linked with the euro and held by subsidiaries located in mainland Europe.
In December 2011 the Company issued $216m and 60m fixed rate USPP notes.
In order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange exposure, 10 cross currency interest swaps were taken out totalling $200m.
These swapped $100m fixed rate into euro fixed rate, and $100m fixed rate into euro variable floating rate finance, including a change of principle currencies that will reverse on redemption.
In order to achieve hedge effectiveness these derivatives were designated into cash flow hedges for the US dollar sterling foreign exchange exposure and fair value hedges for the interest rate element as appropriate and a net investment hedge of the sterling euro foreign exchange exposure.
The remaining $16m and 60m were designated as net investment hedges.
During the year the mark-to-market gains on foreign currency hedging instruments designated as fair value hedges taken to the income statement was 10.1m 2014: 8.2m loss and the fair value adjustment on the related USPP notes was a loss of 10.1m 2014: 8.2m gain.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings to provide a hedge against foreign net investments.
The exchange gains or losses on these borrowings are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is minimised by trading in the subsidiaries local currencies wherever possible, by intra-group hedges and by the use of forward exchange contracts as appropriate.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates on the translation of profits earned by its overseas subsidiaries.
The estimated impact of the change in average exchange rates between 2014 and 2015 on the profit before tax has resulted in a net reduction to the 2015 result of approximately 5.2m 2014: net increase of 1.0m.
The main currency that drives this change is the euro.
Movements in US dollar and other exchange rates were less significant.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 105 e Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from amounts receivable from customers and deposits of cash made with financial institutions.
The Group monitors its credit risk with its customers and only uses financial institutions as counter-parties that have an investment grade credit rating.
The methods used to evaluate customers credit worthiness are described in more detail in note 17.
Capital Management The Board defines capital as the equity of the Group.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital employed and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages wide employee participation and motivation through equity based incentive schemes.
Details of the current Sharesave and Executive Share Option Schemes and the Performance Share Plan, together with shareholding guidelines, are given in the Remuneration report.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Assets and Liabilities The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt is shown in note 20.
The Groups floating rate loans bear interest based on Libor or Euribor.
The floating rate borrowings under the banking facilities are typically rolled over for a period of three months or less, based on the appropriate Libor Euribor rate.
During the year the Group had in place floating to fixed interest rate swaps for euros.
No swaps were in place at the year end.
With respect to the USPP notes, $100m of the $216m issued in December 2011 was converted from fixed US dollar to floating euro by the use of five cross currency interest rate swaps: three of these swaps totalling $50m expire in December 2018 with the remaining two, totalling $50m, expiring in December 2021.
These were in place at the year end with a market value of 34.1m 2014: 0.3 m. An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on borrowings not fixed by interest rate swaps would have reduced profit before tax by approximately 3.2m 2014: 1.4m before accounting for exchange differences, and would reduce net equity by approximately 2.4m 2014: 1.0m.
The range of interest rates applicable to financial liabilities net of derivatives by principal currency is as follows: 2015 2014 Sterling Euro US dollar Sterling Euro US dollar % % % % % % Fixed interest rate 3.0 2.55.0 4.34.8 n a 4.3 4.8 4.8 Floating rate interest margin above: Euribor n a 0.32.7 n a n a 1.4 2.2 n a Libor 1.01.8 n a 1.01.8 0.81.4 n a n a Interest received on cash balances is at normal commercial floating rates.
Currency Exposures In order to help mitigate the risk on translation of the value of non-UK operations into sterling for reporting purposes, a proportion of debt is borrowed in currencies which match or are closely linked to the currencies of those overseas operations.
As at 31 March 2015 non-derivative financial instruments amounting to 225.7m 2014: 263.2m were designated by the Group as net investment hedges in its subsidiaries, primarily in the Eurozone and USA.
During the year nil 2014: nil was taken to the income statement relating to any inefficiency of this net investment hedge.
A movement of 1% in the value of sterling against other foreign currencies mainly the euro would result in a translational impact on the Groups profit before tax of approximately 0.9m 2014: 0.6m and on the Groups net assets of 7.2m 2014: 1.1m.
The closing rate of exchange for the euro at 31 March 2015 was 1.37 2014: 1.21 and for the US dollar was $1.48 2014: $1.66.
The average rate of exchange for the euro for 2015 was 1.27 2014: 1.19 and for the US dollar $1.61 2014: $1.59.

The fair values of the interest rate, foreign currency and cross currency interest rate swaps have been determined by reference to the market price available from the market on which the instruments are traded.
In both 2015 and 2014, all financial instruments measured at fair value are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, whereby the fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
Level 3 inputs are inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the USPP is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Contingent consideration and acquisition remuneration note 23 is held at fair value which is estimated based on latest forecasts by the Ace cluster.
The Group does not hold any Level 1 instruments measured at fair value.

Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognised in the financial statements.
During the period the net gain from financial instruments entered into totalled 1.2m 2014: gain 1.1m.
A gain of 1.0m will arise in the year ending 31 March 2016 assuming interest rates remain at year end levels.

The awards made before 2011 were in the form of allocations of free shares that transfer to participants on the vesting date provided the conditions are met.
Allocations that have vested must be satisfied within 30 days of the vesting date.
After 2010, nil cost options were granted which, subject to the conditions, will be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.

In the UK the mortality assumptions applied as at 31 March 2015 in respect of the main pension scheme are based on the S1PXA tables, as adopted by the UK actuarial profession, using each individual members year of birth with a scaling factor of 105% and allowance for future mortality improvements of 80% of the Long Cohort for males and 60% of the Long Cohort for females subject to a minimum annual improvement of 1.25% for both males and females.
The life expectancies from the age of 65 of scheme members assumed at the balance sheet date in years were as follows: 2015 2014 UK UK Current age: Aged 65: Male 22 22 Female 25 25 Aged 45: Male 24 24 Female 27 26 The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
In the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway these are contributory with funds held separately from the finances of the Group either by trustee-administered funds or by insurance contracts.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 19 years.
Durations and expected payment profile The following table provides information on the distribution of the timing of expected benefit payments for the Group Scheme at 31 March 2015: m Within five years 0.7 6 to 10 years 1.6 11 to 15 years 16.3 16 to 20 years 57.0 21 to 25 years 30.7 106.3 Funded Retirement Benefit Obligations United Kingdom The main retirement benefit obligation in the UK is a defined benefit pension scheme, called the RPC Containers Limited Pension Scheme.
This provides retirement benefits to some former employees and approximately 34% 2014: 33% of current UK employees.
The scheme provides members with benefits based on a three-year average of final pensionable salary and total pensionable service.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term liabilities for past and present employees.
The corporate trustee, which is independent from the Group, has a duty to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustee directors is determined by the schemes corporate and trust documentation and by statute.
All trustee directors are members of the pension scheme and one-third are nominated by current and pensioner members.
Subject to statute, the principal employer, RPC Containers Limited, on the advice of the scheme actuary and in consultation with the trustee, determines the contributions to the scheme.
In addition, in the event that any of the members employing companies are unable to pay their contributions, the trustee may call upon guarantees provided by RPC Group Plc in respect of certain present and future liabilities of the members employing companies in the UK.
This pension scheme was closed to new entrants and to existing members for future service accrual on 31 July 2010 and was replaced with a contract based defined contribution pension plan for future service.
The deficit in the fund calculated in accordance with IAS 19 on accounting for employee benefits as at 31 March 2015 was 39.5m 2014: 32.3m.
The last completed triennial valuation performed by an independent actuary for the trustee of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2012.
The valuation, which is calculated on an ongoing funding basis and is different from that prescribed by IAS 19, showed a deficit of 45.4m.
The Company agreed to make contributions to cover the schemes expenses and pay monthly deficit reduction contributions of 3.0m each year increasing by 3% per annum until 31 March 2016, and 2.1m each year increasing by 3% per annum from 01 April 2016 with the aim of eliminating the deficit over 10.5 years from 01 April 2013.
Previously the deficit reduction contributions had been approximately 1.9m per annum.
As a result of the acquisition of Superfos Industries a s, the Group acquired two closed trustee-administered defined benefit pension arrangements in the UK providing benefits based on final pensionable salary and pensionable service.
The Superfos Runcorn Limited Pension Fund was closed to future accrual on 5 April 2010.
The deficit in the fund calculated in accordance with IAS 19 as at 31 March 2015 was 4.0m 2014: 2.9m.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2013 showed a funding deficit of 3.6m.

The Company agreed to pay combined annual deficit reduction contributions and expenses for both plans of 0.4m increasing by an allowance for inflation each year.
120 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 March 2015 29.
Employee Benefits continued As a result of the acquisition of the Manuplastics Group of companies, the Group acquired one trustee-administered defined benefit pension arrangement in the UK providing benefits based on final pensionable salary and pensionable service.
The Pension Fund was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2000.
The deficit in the fund calculated in accordance with IAS 19 as at 31 March 2015 was 1.0m 2014: 0.5m.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation as at 6 April 2010 showed a funding deficit of 0.2m.
As a result of the acquisition of the M & H Plastics Group of companies, the Group acquired one trustee-administered defined benefit pension arrangement in the UK providing benefits based on final pensionable salary and pensionable service.
The Pension Fund was closed to new entrants on 1 August 2005.
The deficit in the fund calculated in accordance with IAS 19 as at 31 March 2015 was 24.1m 2014: 10.1m.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2013 showed a funding deficit of 6.1m.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation in the financial statements was measured using the projected unit credit method based on the last actuarial valuation for IAS 19 purposes allowing for IAS 19 financial assumptions and any further improvements in life expectancy.
The Netherlands In the Netherlands there are a number of defined benefit retirement plans.
These are funded by contributions to insurance policies or a separately administered fund.
There were five pension plans in the Netherlands providing career average four plans or final salary one plan pensions and disability benefits under contracts with insurance companies.
Active employees pay a proportion of the premiums charged by the insurance company.
One of the defined benefit plans is in respect of a single key employee.
Although this is a defined benefit plan, the company has a contractual agreement with the employee which places a monetary cap on the employer contribution.
Consequently, RPC is no longer expected to be exposed to any material actuarial risks in relation to the accrued benefits in this plan.
The plan has therefore been treated as a Defined Contribution plan with effect from 1 April 2013 and the balance sheet liability at that date has been eliminated via a settlement gain.
This results in a one-off credit of 0.1m being recognised in 2014.
The IAS 19 liability and service costs for the remaining DB plans are calculated by local actuaries by rolling forward the latest data available from the insurance companies and current salary data from the relevant RPC subsidiary.
One of the plans was acquired as a result of the acquisition of Superfos Industries a s in respect of a former business in the Netherlands and current Dutch employees of Superfoss German operation.
The deficit recognised in the balance sheet at 31 March 2015 in respect of all continuing defined benefit plans was 1.6m 2014: 2.4m.
The separately administered RPC Tedeco-Gizeh Deventer Pension Plan was closed with effect from 1 January 2007 and all accrued past service benefits and certain early retirement benefits were transferred to the Dutch Plastics Industry Pension Plan.
As part of the arrangements, RPC agreed to make additional contributions to make up the deficit in the funding of certain early retirement and pre-pension benefits.
The deficit included in the retirement benefit obligations as at 31 March 2015 was 0.3m 2014: 0.7m.
In addition on the acquisition of the Promens Group a similar scheme was acquired with a deficit of 0.3m on acquisition and as at 31 March 2015.
Unfunded Retirement Benefit Obligations Most of the Groups German operations provide non-contributory pension plans financed by balance sheet provisions calculated by a local actuary on an annual basis according to local requirements.
There is no external funding for these plans although they are secured by insolvency insurance required under German law.
In general, the plans provide a fixed retirement benefit not related to salaries and are closed to new entrants.
Pension increases are granted every three years based on price inflation.
The IAS 19 liability and service cost are based on the annual valuation provided by the local actuary using the projected unit method.
All the Groups subsidiaries in France, including those acquired in the acquisition of Superfos Industries a s and the Promens Group, provide unfunded retirement indemnities according to the applicable collective agreement.
The benefit takes the form of a lump sum payable on reaching retirement age.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, a change in the indemnities payable under the Plasturgie collective agreement, which applied to four of the Groups operations at the time, resulted in an unrecognised past service cost which is being amortised over the expected period to vesting.
Due to the closure of Troyes announced under the Fitter for the Future Programme, a past service cost gain of 0.8m was recognised in 2014.
RPCs Italian businesses are required to provide termination benefits payable on leaving service, including retirement.
The termination benefit amounts to one months deferred pay per year of service revalued each year.
For RPC Superfos Italy, a small sales office, this benefit continues to accrue.
For employees of the larger RPC Cobelplast Montonate, service accrual ceased from 1 January 2007 when new regulations replaced this benefit with defined contribution pension arrangements.
This liability was transferred to liabilities held for sale in 2014.
In February 2015 a new obligation was acquired with the Promens Group with a value on acquisition of 0.4m.
The current and revalued past service liability for continuing operations included in the defined benefit obligation for all Italian schemes as at 31 March 2015 was 0.6m 2014: 0.1m.
The Groups operations in Poland are required to provide for a retirement indemnity of one months salary for employees who have worked for at least 25 years for any employer.
Disability and mandatory death benefits are also provided.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 6.4m 2014: 5.7m to its defined benefit plans in the next financial year.
This includes proposed contributions to the main UK pension scheme described above of 3.6m 2014: 3.5m.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 121 Multi-Employer Plans Certain Group employees in the Netherlands and Sweden participate in multi-employer or industry-wide defined benefit pension plans as follows: Number of current employees participating 2015 2014 m m Stichting Beheer  OWASE 33 35  Branche Pensioenregeling Dutch Plastics Industry Plan 62 56 Swedish ITP2 Plan 24 22 The Group is not a significant participant in any of these plans.
In respect of all three multi-employer plans, there is no contractual agreement between the multi-employer plan and their participants that would determine how any surpluses or deficits will be distributed or funded.
Employer contributions are fixed by the plans governing bodies for all participating employers.
It is not possible to separately identify within the plans the assets and liabilities which relate to RPC Group employees.
Therefore, the Group accounts for the plans as defined contribution arrangements.
The core participating companies in the OWASE plan comprise the former owner of RPC Bebo Nederland, Goor, prior to its acquisition by RPC.
It provides career weighted average salary pension benefits accrued at the rate of 1.75% of annual pensionable salary.
The employer contributions are 22.5% of pensionable salary.
The latest information available on the funding status of the OWASE plan on the local funding valuation basis according to Dutch law indicates that the plan is in surplus.
Therefore, contributions for RPC are expected to remain at the current level.
The Plastics Industry Plan is a funded, defined benefit, career weighted average salary scheme providing benefits at the rate of 1.875% per annum of pensionable earnings.
The employer contribution was 15.0% of pensionable earnings from 1 January 2014.
The latest information available on the funding status of the Plastics Industry Plan is shown in the table below.
Employees of RPC Superfos in Sweden participate in the ITP2 Plan.
This is a multi-employer plan for salaried employees working in private industry and commerce, established under the collective agreement negotiated by the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and with the cartel PTK .
TheITP2Plan provides defined benefits based on final salary, including retirement, long-term disability and survivors pensions.
The pension level is around 65%of pay inclusive of social security for the average employee.
