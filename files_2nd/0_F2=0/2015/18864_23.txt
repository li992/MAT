Earnings per share Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOP and SIP.
Prior to 8 April 2014, holders of the B Ordinary shares had rights to share in profits which differed to those of the holders of Ordinary shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares.
Earnings per share figures have therefore been presented separately for the B Ordinary shares, up until 8 April 2014.
The B Ordinary shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares were reclassified as Ordinary shares on 8 April 2014.
The B Ordinary shareholders were only entitled to dividends after aggregate distributions of 18.25 million had been made to the holders of Ordinary shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares.
Prior to 8 April 2014, aggregate distributions of this amount had not been made.
As a result no earnings were attributable to the Ordinary B shares in the earnings per share EPS calculations.
Diluted earnings per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion ofallpotentially dilutive shares.
The Group had potentially dilutive shares in the form of share options, warrants and unvested shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOP and SIP.
Adjusted earnings per share is the main measure of earnings per share used by the Group and is calculated using an underlying profit measure attributable to the holders of Ordinary shares in the parent, which is defined as profit attributable to the holders of Ordinary shares in the parent, before long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, other gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the tax impact of the adjusting items.

it 4.5 0.4 Carrying amount at 31 December 457.1 51.2 Orogo Limited was integrated into the UK CGU during 2015.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate and the Underlying EBITDA growth which is a function of increases in the number of orders generated and increases in costs, together with other factors.
Management uses pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the particular CGU.
Underlying EBITDA growth is based on past experience and managements future expectations.
The growth in orders and increases in costs are based on recent results and managements expectations for the future.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board.
Management expects that some markets will enjoy a period of sustained high growth continuing from the end of the current budgetary cycle to maturity the medium-term.
During this period each CGU will continue to acquire new consumers and increase order activity above and beyond the long-term growth rate applicable to each market.
Management expects that a number of CGUs with the exception of the UK, Denmark, Ireland and Swizerland, will reach maturity after a period in excess of five years and therefore considers it appropriate for the forecasts toextend beyond a five-year period.
A suitable medium-term growth rate, based on previous experience of growth rates including historical growth rates of all CGUs has been applied individually to reflect each CGUs activity in this period.
After this, a long-term growth rate is applied.
This is typically between 5 and 7 years from the start of the forecast period.
The Directors believe that it is appropriate to use forecasts extending beyond five years where a CGU is expected to grow significantly beyond five years and not reachmaturity within that period.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows were in the range of 9.1% to 15.3% for all geographies 2014: 10.6% to 18.4%.
Thelong-term growth rates used in the forecast cash flows were in the range of 1.4% to 3.1% 2014: 1.6% to 2.2%.

Goodwill continued Years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 For all CGUs, the value-in-use was in excess of the carrying value of the CGU.
As a result, no impairments were required.
Sensitivity analysis The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for each CGU.
This included reducing the future cash flows and increasing discount rates.
With the exception of the Australia & New Zealand and the Mexican CGU, no reasonably expected change in the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations would give rise to an impairment charge.
The impairment review for the year ended 31 December 2014 concluded that there were no CGUs where a reasonable change in the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations would give rise to an impairment charge.
The sensitivity process included: increasing pre-tax discount rates by 2.0%: and reducing the anticipated Underlying EBITDA growth and hence future cash flow.
For illustrative purposes, the reduction of the anticipated 2025 revenues and Underlying EBITDA resulted in the Underlying EBITDA reducing by 22.0% in Australia & New Zealand and 56.9% in Mexico.
If the sensitivities for the Australia & New Zealand and Mexican CGUs were taken in isolation, there would be the following impairment: Amounts by which the recoverable amount exceeds is less than the CGUs carrying value Australia & New Zealand Mexico m m Increased pre-tax discount rate 13.4 15.0 Reduced Underlying EBITDA growth 43.0 12.2 In order for the carrying amount and recoverable amount to be equal: the pre-tax discount rate for Australia & New Zealand would have to increase by 1.7% and that for Mexico would have to increase by 6.4%: or projected 2025 Underlying EBITDA decreases by 15% for Australia & New Zealand and 40% for Mexico.

Financial instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is primarily exposed to the Euro, Australian Dollar, Danish Krone and Canadian Dollar.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% depreciation and 10% appreciation in Pound Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group.
Impact on income statement and other comprehensive income loss Appreciation in Pound Sterling Depreciation in Pound Sterling Income Income Income Income statement Equity statement Equity statement Equity statement Equity 2015 2015 2014 2014 2015 2015 2014 2014 m m m m m m m m Euros 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 Australian Dollars 0.1 0.1 Swiss Franc 0.1 0.1 Canadian Dollars 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 Danish Kroner 0.3 0.5 0.3 0.6 The Groups sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currencies is the result of increased activity in the foreign owned subsidiaries which hasled to a significant increase in foreign currency denominated trade payables, trade receivables and intercompany borrowings.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date.
For assets andfloating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of asset liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 10% increase or decrease in the interest rate is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to keymanagement personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 10% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2015 would increase by 49,000 2014: 41,000 : and there would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
TheGroups exposure and the credit ratings of its major counterparties are continuously monitored.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of consumers, spread across geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed onthe financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which are stated net of impairment losses, represents theGroups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international creditrating agencies.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actualcash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
In March 2015, the Group signed a 90 million revolving credit facility for a five-year period.
The facility is unsecured and contains common financial covenants for the Company and its subsidiaries that the ratio of total net debt to Underlying EBITDA must not exceed 3.0, interest cover ratio of Underlying EBITDA to net finance charges must not be less than 4.0, and any new earn out deferred consideration must not exceed one times the Underlying EBITDA.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued e Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The Groups balance sheet includes significant goodwill and other intangible assets.
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use.
Determining whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU to which the asset has been allocated.
The value-inuse calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model.
The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next three years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to, or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the CGU being tested.
The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for the period beyond the three budgets.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed andfurther explained in note 14. f Fair value measurement and valuation process Some of the Groups assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, particularly intangible assets acquired through acquisition.
Inestimating fair value, the Group uses market observable data where available.
Where market observable data is not available, recognised valuation methodologies are used.
Third party valuers are used depending on the size and complexity of the acquisition.
g Taxation The Groups tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges arising in each jurisdiction.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process.
Resolving tax issues can in some cases take several years as it is not always within the control of the Group and often depends on the efficiency of legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdiction.
Provisions, when recognised, are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
However the final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profits, losses and or cash flows, which could differ from the provision and in such event the Group would be required to make an adjustment in a subsequent period.
