Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The fair value hierarchy disclosures required by FRS 102 are given below.
The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 102 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: a Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market.
Quoted in an active market in this context means quoted prices are readily and regularly available and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted price is usually the current bid price.
b Prices of recent transactions for identical instruments When quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place.
If the entity can demonstrate that the last transaction price is not a good estimate of fair value eg because it reflects the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distress sale, that price is adjusted.
c Valuation techniques using observable market value If the market for the asset is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, an entity estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique.
The objective of using a valuation technique is to estimate what the transaction price would have been on the measurement date in an arms length exchange motivated by normal business considerations.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 c on page 42.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 102 hierarchy at 31st December.
2015 2014 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities 000 000 000 000 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 902,653 885,787 1 Valuation techniques using observable market value 2,153 2,990 1,148 1,529 Total value of investments 904,806 2,990 886,935 1,529 1 Includes forward foreign currency contracts, and Kane Holdings which had a market value at 31st December 2015 of 1,214,000 2014: 1,148,000.

As a result in the transition from old UK GAAP to FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the 1,529,000 that was categorised as Level 2 or b, has been reclassified as Level c. 53
