19 Financial instruments 1 Financial risk factors The Group is exposed to a number of different market risks in the normal course of business including liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Liquidity risk Established procedures are in place to ensure that the operational and working capital requirements of the Group can be met at all times.
These include: regular review, monitoring and forecasting of working capital requirements across Group companies: use of short term, local bank facilities: operation of short term money market dealing lines: and the implementation and ongoing review of committed multi-currency bank facilities, which are available at short notice.
During the year the Group refinanced its bank borrowing facilities with the amendment and extension of its multi-currency revolving facilities to 250 million expiring in September 2019, carrying a LIBOR based floating rate of interest.
At 1 February 2015 the Groups headroom on this facility was 181.2 million 2014: 159.5 million on a 200 million facility.
during the year the Group also refinanced US$85 million US private placement notes repayable in August 2016 to September2024.
Credit risk The Group has a customer credit policy in place and the exposure tocredit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through the use of customer credit limits.
Investments to maximise the return on surplus cash are allowed only in short term instruments and only with counterparties that have sound credit ratings.
The Groups treasury policy stipulates minimum ratings that institutions must have before deposits can be made above a series of defined thresholds.
Given thehigh credit quality of counterparties with whom the Group has investments, the Directors do not expect any counterparty to fail to meetits obligations.
At 1 February 2015 and 2 February 2014 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset included inthe balance sheet.
Interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings.
If interest rates on variable rate foreign currency denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.1 million lower higher 2013 14: 0.1 million.
If interest rates on variable rate pound sterling denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with allother variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.3 million lower higher 2013 14: 0.2 million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 119 Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases andborrowings that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Euro and US dollar.
The Group hedges significant foreign currency exposures in respect offorecast sales and purchases of inventory through foreign exchange contracts.
All such foreign exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there isacorresponding cash flow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movement in foreign exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all ofits long-term investments in overseas assets.
If the average US dollar rate against the pound sterling was higher lower by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would have been 0.4 million lower higher as a result of a similar one cent change at 1 February 2015.
If the average Euro rate against thepound sterling was higher lower by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.4 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would have been 0.1 million lower higher as a result of a similar one cent change at 1 February 2015.
2 Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group will take into consideration the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, the level of debt and the number of shares in issue.
When monitoring capital, the Group takes into consideration its gearingratio, both including and excluding its post-retirement benefit obligations.
This is calculated as the ratio of net debt to total capital total equity adjusted for post-retirement benefit obligations as appropriate, as shown in note 26.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings and the debtelement of preference shares as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
At the year end, the netdebt to total capital ratio was 1.7 2014: 1.8.
The Group has two principal debt covenants in respect of its US private placement notes and revolving credit facility.
These covenants relate to the Groups Net Borrowings to EBITDA ratio and EBITDA to Net Interest Payable ratio both on a rolling 12 month basis.
At the year end, the Group comfortably met these covenants.

During the financial year ended 1 February 2015, 3.6 million net fair value gains were recognised in other comprehensive income 2013 14: 1.7 million net fair value gains.
Gains of 3.4 million 2013 14: 4.3million losses have been transferred to cost of sales for contractswhich matured during the year.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups US dollar denominated private placement notes of US$265 million 2014: US$265 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its US subsidiaries.
TheGroups Euro denominated unsecured loans of 25 million partially hedge the Groups investment inits Eurozone subsidiaries.
120 Premier Farnell Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Fair values The category, book values, and fair values of the Groups financial instruments are as follows: Financial liabilities Assets at fair value Derivatives at fair Loans and measured at through profit and value used for cash receivables amortised cost loss flow hedging Total Fair value At 1 February 2015 m m m m m m Non-current assets Investments held at fair value 1.0 1.0 1.0 Current assets Derivative financial instruments 2.4 2.4 2.4 Trade and other receivables 126.0 126.0 126.0 Cash and cash equivalents 43.8 43.8 43.8 Current liabilities Financial liabilities 6.3 6.3 6.3 Derivative financial instruments 0.2 0.2 0.2 Trade and other payables 129.9 0.8 130.7 130.7 Non-current liabilities Bank and other loans 67.8 67.8 67.5 Private placement notes 176.0 176.0 184.6 Preference shares 52.5 52.5 52.0 Total 169.8 432.5 0.2 2.2 260.3 268.1 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 121 Financial liabilities Assets at fair value Derivatives at Loans and measured at through profit fair value used for Fair receivables amortised cost and loss cash flow hedging Total value At 2 February 2014 m m m m m m Non-current assets Investments held at fair value 0.8 0.8 0.8 Current assets Derivative financial instruments 2.0 2.0 2.0 Trade and other receivables 115.6 115.6 115.6 Cash and cash equivalents 42.8 42.8 42.8 Current liabilities Current borrowings 1.8 1.8 1.8 Trade and other payables 117.7 0.7 118.4 118.4 Non-current liabilities Bank and other loans 44.4 44.4 44.2 Private placement notes 161.0 161.0 165.2 Preference shares 63.4 63.4 63.1 Total 158.4 388.3 0.1 2.0 227.8 231.5 Prepayments are excluded from trade and other receivables balance, as this analysis is required only for financial instruments.
The main methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values offinancial instruments are as follows: investments held at fair value: are valued using listed market prices.
The fair values are within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy: derivatives: forward exchange contracts are marked to market using listed market prices.
The fair values are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy: current borrowings: fair value is equal to current value, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The fair values are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy: bank loans bear short term floating interest rates of LIBOR plus a premium, and as a result the fair values are the same as the book values.
The fair values are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy: US dollar private placement notes bear coupons between 4.05.2%.
The fair value is based on discounted future principal and interest cash flows, using discount rates of 3.0 5.1% calculated from treasury yields for similar terms and adjusted to reflect the Group credit rating.
The fair values are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy: convertible redeemable preference shares: fair value is based on quoted market prices.
The fair values are within Level 1: trade and other receivables payables: the notional amounts for trade and other receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year are deemed to reflect their fair value: and contingent consideration: the fair value measurements are included innote 22.
At 1 February 2015, cash and cash equivalents are subject to offsetting and enforceable master pooling arrangements and is presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a net amount of 43.8m.
5 Fair value estimation The valuation methods for Group financial instruments held at fair value are defined by the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observed for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 2 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3.

If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to the present value.
