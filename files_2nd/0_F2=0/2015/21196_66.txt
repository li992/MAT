The net impact on total loans is nil.
Of the above loans, 20,948 million 2014: 23,771 million are due to be recovered in more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
Loans at fair value Fair values have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using appropriate current interest rates for each portfolio of mortgages.
Further details of the fair value methodology are given in note 22.
The cumulative change in fair value of loans attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2015 was a 1,994 million loss 2014: 3,070 million loss.
The significant reduction in this figure of 1,076 million 2014: 361 million increase is predominantly owing to UK Lifes commercial mortgage loans restructure and recovery programme, which completed in October 2015 with the sale of 2.2 billion of commercial mortgage loans to Lone Star.
1 Non-securitised mortgage loans include 3.3 billion 2014 Restated : 3.5 billion relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses which are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or other emergency services related premises.
For all such loans, government support is provided through either direct funding or reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan.
Although the loan principal is not , the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.
1 Healthcare, Infrastructure and PFI other loans of 1.2 billion 2014 Restated : 1.1 billion are secured against the income from healthcare and educational premises.
Loans at amortised cost The fair value of these loans at 31 December 2015 was 3,228 million 2014: 4,240 million.

The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities note 50.
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans where it is considered appropriate in order to reduce the risk of non-recovery.
This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy for the majority of the loan balances above.
In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
