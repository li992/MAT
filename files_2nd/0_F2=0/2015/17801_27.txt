Overview 1-11 Strategic Report 12-41 Our Governance 42-71 Our Results 72-107 Shareholders Information 108 f Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies and consequently exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
The Groups presentational currency is sterling: as a result the Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk due to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of non-sterling assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to hedge against foreign currency transaction exposures where appropriate.
The carrying amount of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 Euros 5,113 8,627 The balances shown above include intercompany loan balances held between group companies which create a foreign currency exposure to the income statement.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower.
A positive number below represents an increase in profit before tax.
Euro currency impact 2015 2014 000 000 Sterling strengthens by 10% 1,249 Sterling weakens by 10% 1,527 The Groups sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the current year due to beginning to trade in Europe.
The impact above is mainly as a result of intercompany loans held in a foreign currency.
In managements opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
