Trade receivables: credit risk The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group believes that there is no significant geographical or customer concentration of credit risk.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a decentralised basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
