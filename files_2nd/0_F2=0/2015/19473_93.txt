The Group believes that this revision is not material to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
Going concern For information on going concern see page 51 of the accountability section of the annual report.
Key estimates and assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The key estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the accounting policy for goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash flow projections for each cash generating unit and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cash generating units.
For details of impairment testing see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies for goodwill and impairment testing are set out below.
Retirement benefits The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations.
There are two principal funded defined benefit pension plans, in the UK and US, and an unfunded retiree medical plan in the US.
The costs and present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on factors such as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses estimates based on previous experience and external actuarial advice in determining these future cash flows and the discount rate.
The accounting policy for retirement benefit obligations is set out below.
Details of the assumptions used for the two principal defined benefit pension plans and the retiree medical plan and sensitivities are set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
