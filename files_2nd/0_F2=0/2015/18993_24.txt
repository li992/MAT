These adjustments include: The Group has an economic interest in M&S Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, by way of a Relationship Agreement that entitles the Group to a 50% share of the pro ts of M&S Bank after appropriate deductions.
The Group does not share in any losses of M&S Bank and is not obliged to refund any fees received from M&S Bank although future income may be impacted by signi cant one-off deductions.
Since the year ended 31 December 2012 M&S Bank has recognised an estimated liability for redress to customers in respect of possible mis-selling of financial products in its audited financial statements.
The Groups fee income from M&S Bank has been reduced by the deduction of this estimated liability under the Relationship Agreement in both the current and prior years.
The total charge to date for the deduction in the Groups fee income is 139.2m.
The deduction in the period is 53.7m.
This has been treated as a non-underlying adjustment to reported pro t before tax, in line with previous periods.
On 26 September 2014 the Group reached agreement with M&S Bank and HSBC over a number of issues in connection with the Relationship Agreement including the extent of historical mis-selling charges.
This resulted in an ex-gratia payment of 40.0m by HSBC which was recognised as a non-underlying credit in the period net of 0.1m legal fees, consistent with the deduction to the Groups fee income.
On the same basis as previous periods, any future increase in the liability recognised by M&S Bank will result in a further reduction in the Groups fee income.
Restructuring costs relating to the Groups strategy to transition to a one tier distribution network and the closure costs of the legacy logistics sites current period cost of 10.2m.
To date, 72.7m has been expensed in relation to this programme.
Restructuring costs have been incurred in Ireland in previous periods following a thorough commercial review of the Ireland business.

International store review in the current year relates to the impairment of assets 34.9m and onerous lease provisions 2.3m in underperforming stores in Western Europe, Ireland and China.
The prior year charge relates to the impairment of assets 13.6m and onerous lease provisions 8.3m in underperforming International stores in non-strategic locations in China and the Czech Group.
Pension credit recognised in the prior year as a result of changes to the Marks and Spencer Ireland fide ned bene t scheme rules 17.5m whereby the discretions for post-retirement pension increases were removed and prior year pension credit arising from the cessation of the practice of granting pension increases to transferred-in pensions for all members in the UK fide ned bene t scheme 10.0m.
Strategic programme costs relating to the strategy announcements made in November 2010, including the costs associated with the initial Focus on the UK plans.
These included asset write-off s and accelerated depreciation.
These costs were not considered normal operating costs of the business.

The underlying earnings per share gures have also been calculated based on earnings before items that are one-off in nature, signi cant and are not considered normal operating costs of the underlying business see note 5.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has four classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year, unvested shares granted under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, unvested shares granted under the Restricted Share Plan and unvested shares within the Performance Share Plan that have met the relevant performance conditions at the end of the reporting period.

In line with the requirements of IAS 10 Events after the reporting period, this dividend has not been recognised within these results.
A dividend reinvestment plan DRIP is available to shareholders who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the Company.
The shares will go ex-dividend on 28 May 2015.
For those shareholders electing to receive the DRIP the last date for receipt of a new election is 19 June 2015.

11 RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group provides pension arrangements for the bene t of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme a fide ned bene t arrangement which was closed to new entrants with eff ect from 1 April 2002 and Your M&S Pension Saving Plan a fide ned contribution arrangement which has been open to new members with eff ect from 1 April 2003.
The fide ned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund, such contributions are based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid.
Members bene ts are determined by the amount of contributions paid by the Group and the member, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to buy at retirement.
As a result, actuarial risk that bene ts will be lower than expected and investment risk that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations fall on the employee.
The fide ned bene t arrangement operates on a final salary basis and at the year end had some 12,000 active members last year 13,000, 54,000 deferred members last year 55,000 and 51,000 pensioners last year 51,000.
At the year end, the fide ned contribution arrangement had some 38,000 active members last year 38,000 and some 6,000 deferred members last year 5,000.
The scheme is governed by a Trustee board which is independent of the Group.
The Group also operates a small funded fide ned bene t pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
This scheme closed to future accrual from 31 October 2013.
Retirement bene ts also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement bene ts.
105 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED Within the total Group retirement bene t cost of 74.9m last year 53.5m, 33.7m last year 27.0m relates to the UK fide ned bene t scheme, 36.4m last year 39.2m to the UK fide ned contribution scheme and 4.8m last year 12.7m to other retirement bene t schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the UK fide ned Bene t Pension Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2012 and showed a fide cit of 290m.
As a result, a funding plan of 112m cash contributions was agreed with the Trustees.
The Group contributed payments of 28m to the UK fide ned bene t scheme in March 2014 and March 2015 in the current financial year, and expects to contribute an additional 28m each year until March 2017.
The diff erence between the valuation and the funding plan is expected to be met by better than expected investment returns on the schemes assets.
Future contributions to meet the cost of accruing bene ts to the UK scheme are made at the rate of 23.4% of pensionable salaries up to the next full actuarial valuation.
By funding its fide ned bene t pension schemes, the Group is exposed to the risk that the cost of meeting its obligations is higher than anticipated.
This could occur for several reasons, for example: Investment returns on the schemes assets may be lower than anticipated, especially if falls in asset values are not matched by similar falls in the value of the schemes liabilities.
The level of price in ation may be higher than that assumed, resulting in higher payments from the schemes.
Scheme members may live longer than assumed, for example due to unanticipated advances in medical healthcare.
Members may also exercise or not exercise options in a way that leads to increases in the schemes liabilities, for example through early retirement or commutation of pension for cash.
Legislative changes could also lead to an increase in the schemes liabilities.
In addition, the Group has an obligation to the UK fide ned bene t scheme via the interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership refer to note 12, through which the Group is exposed to additional risks.
In particular, under the legal terms of the Partnership, a default by the Group on the rental payments to the Partnership or a future change in legislation could trigger earlier or higher payments, or an increase in the collateral to be provided by the Group.

Financial assumptions The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent quali ed actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Bene ts in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes and are as follows: 2015 2014 % % Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 1.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service 1.93.0 2.23.3 Discount rate 3.10 4.45 In ation rate 3.1 3.4 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.1 7.4 The in ation rate of 3.1% re ects the Retail Price Index RPI rate.
Certain bene ts have been calculated with reference to the Consumer Price Index CPI as the in ationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.1% last year 2.4% has been used.
OUR PERFORMANCE OUR BUSINESS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE 106 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED C. Demographic assumptions Apart from post-retirement mortality, the demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme performed as at 31 March 2012.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2012 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent years.
The speci c mortality rates used are based on the VITA lite tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2015 2014 Current pensioners at age 65 males 22.7 22.4 females 24.4 24.1 Future pensioners at age 65 males 22.4 21.8 females 25.1 24.6 Deferred pensioners at age 65 males 23.2 22.6 females 26.0 25.4 D. Sensitivity analysis The table below summarises the estimated impact of changes in the principal actuarial assumptions on the pension scheme surplus: 2015 2014 m m Decrease increase in scheme surplus caused by an increase in the discount rate of 0.25% last year 0.5% 70.0 50.0 Increase decrease in scheme surplus caused by an increase in the in ation rate of 0.25% 30.0 50.0 Increase in scheme surplus caused by a decrease in the average life expectancy of one year 330.0 230.0 The sensitivity analysis above is based on a change in one assumption while holding all others constant.
Therefore interdependencies between the assumptions have not been taken into account within the analysis.
E. Analysis of assets The investment strategy of the UK fide ned bene t pension scheme is driven by its liability pro le, in particular its in ation-linked pension bene ts.
In addition to its interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership refer to note 12, the scheme invests in diff erent types of bonds including corporate bonds and gilts and derivative instruments including in ation, interest rate, cross-currency and total return swaps in order to align movements in the value of its assets with movements in its liabilities arising from changes in market conditions.
Broadly the scheme has hedging that covers 90% of interest rate movements and 85% of in ation movements, as measured on the Trustees funding assumptions which use a discount rate derived from gilt yields.
The fair value of the plan assets at the end of the reporting period for each category are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Debt investments government 4,180.0 2,319.0 corporate bonds 1,211.0 1,255.7 asset backed securities and structured debt 363.9 232.0 Scottish Limited Partnership interest see note 12 531.3 574.7 Equity investments quoted 1,131.8 998.1 Equity investments unquoted 178.0 110.1 Property 327.1 278.6 Derivatives interest and in ation rate swap contracts 127.5 51.3 foreign exchange contracts and other derivatives 190.9 123.3 Hedge and reinsurance funds 313.6 329.8 Cash and cash equivalents 306.2 444.1 Other 9.8 12.7 8,596.5 6,729.4 The fair values of the above equity and debt investments are determined based on publicly available market prices wherever available.
Unquoted investments, hedge funds and reinsurance funds are stated at fair value estimates provided by the manager of the investment or fund.
Property includes both quoted and unquoted investments.
The market value of the Scottish Limited Partnership interest is based on the expected cash ows and benchmark asset-backed credit spreads.
It is the policy of the Scheme to hedge a proportion of interest rate and in ation risk.
The Scheme reduces its foreign currency exposure using forward foreign exchange contracts.
At year end, the UK scheme indirectly held 199,032 last year 199,523 ordinary shares in the Company through its investment in UK Equity Index Funds.

As such, the Partnership is consolidated into the results of the Group.
The Partnership holds 1.6bn last year 1.6bn of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the exibility to substitute alternative properties.
The limited partnership interest held by the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme entitles the Pension Scheme to receive an annual distribution of 71.9m from the pro ts of the Partnership earned from rental income.
The Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK pension scheme of 512.9m last year 568.7m is valued at the net present value of the future expected distributions from the Partnership.
During the year to 28 March 2015 an interest charge of 16.1m last year 17.8m was recognised in the income statement representing the unwinding of the discount included in this obligation.
Under IAS 19, the Partnership interest of the Pension Scheme in the Partnership is included within the UK pension scheme assets, valued at 531.3m last year 574.7m, refer to note 11E.
13 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS This year a net credit of 1.1m was recognised for share-based payments last year charge of 21.3m.
The total balance comprises a credit of 15.0m last year charge of 4.1m relating to Performance Share Plans off set by a charge of 9.0m last year charge of 9.6m relating to the Save As You Earn Share Scheme.
The remaining 4.9m charge is spread over the other schemes.
Further details of the option and share schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 76.
Save As You Earn scheme Sharesave, the Companys Save As You Earn scheme, was approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM.
Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may off er options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into Her Majestys Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
The price at which options may be off ered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the off er date.
The options may normally be exercised during the six-month period after the completion of the SAYE contract.

The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years on the assumption that 10% last year 10% of options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Group.
Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan is the primary long-term incentive plan for approximately 150 of the most senior managers and was first approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM.
Under the Plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be off ered.
The extent to which an award vests is measured over a three-year period against a balanced scorecard of financial measures which currently include Earnings Per Share EPS, Return on Capital Employed ROCE and Revenue.
The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will also be paid on vesting.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 68.
Awards under this scheme have been made in each year since 2005.
During the year, 7,338,609 shares last year 7,113,690 were awarded under the Plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded was 439.3p last year 440.7p.
As at 28 March 2015, 18,805,388 shares last year 21,170,536 were outstanding under the scheme.
As set out on page 66 of this Annual Report, the Companys existing Performance Share Plan expires in 2015.
The Company is therefore seeking shareholder approval in 2015 for a replacement Plan, the rules and operation of which are substantially the same as the current Plan.
Further details of the replacement Performance Share Plan can be found in the Notice of Meeting 2015.
C. Deferred Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Share Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005 06 as part of the Annual Bonus Scheme for approximately 550 of the most senior managers.
As part of the scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which will be held for three years.
There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment, and the value of any dividends earned during the deferred period will also be paid on vesting.
During the year, 20,882 shares last year 1,658,133 have been awarded under the Plan in relation to the annual bonus.
The fair value of the shares awarded was 437.0p last year 437.0p.
As at 28 March 2015, 2,487,477 shares last year 5,024,149 were outstanding under the scheme.
D. Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention and recruitment of senior managers who are vital to the success of the business.
The Plan operates for senior managers below executive director level.
Awards vest at the end of the restricted period typically between one and three years subject to the participant still being in employment of the Company on the relevant vesting date.

E. Republic of Ireland Save As You Earn scheme Sharesave, the Companys Save As You Earn scheme was introduced in 2009 to all employees in the Republic of Ireland for a ten-year period, after approval by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
The scheme is subject to Irish Revenue rules which limit the maximum monthly saving to 500 per month.
The Company chose in 2009 to set a monthly savings cap of 320 per month to align the maximum savings amount allowed within the UK scheme.
When the savings contract is started, options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will buy when the contract matures, at a discounted price set at the start of the scheme.
The price at which the options may be off ered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive days preceding the off er date.
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
During the year, 121,086 last year 62,734 options were granted, at a fair value of 90.8p last year 105.1p.

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash-generating units CGUs which include the combined retail and wholesale businesses for each location.
Brands include the per una brand cost of 80.0m net book value 24.2m and the M&S Mode brand cost of 32.4m.
The per una brand is a fide nite life intangible asset and is amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years and is only assessed for impairment where such indicators exist.
The M&S Mode brands have been attributed an inde nite life as they give the Group the future right to use the M&S brand across Europe.
This is consistent with the Groups expansion plans in Europe and existing M&S brand recognition from its current presence.
Similar to goodwill, the M&S Mode brands are assessed for impairment annually based on their value in use.
The M&S Mode brands have been allocated for impairment testing across the European business.
The value in use calculations use cash ows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a three-year period.
These budgets have regard to historical performance and knowledge of the current market, together with managements views on the future achievable growth and the impact of committed initiatives.
The cash ows which derive from the budgets include ongoing capital expenditure required to maintain the store network.
Cash ows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the long-term growth rate and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate.
The longterm growth rate has been determined with reference to forecast GDP growth for the territories in which these businesses operate.
Management believes this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill and brands under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not re ect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
These growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
The pre-tax discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which speci c market-related premium adjustments are made.

The discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 9.3% to 27.9% last year 13.1% to 28.9%.
Cash ows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated at long-term growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 4.0% last year 1.0% to 2.5%.
Sensitivity analysis Whilst management believes the assumptions are realistic it is possible that an impairment would be identi ed if any of the above key assumptions were changed signi cantly.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables held constant.
Management have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in any key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of goodwill or brands to exceed the value in use.
Additions to property, plant and equipment during the year amounting to nil last year nil were nanced by new finance leases.

21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury policy The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group treasury function also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from the Groups operations and nancing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
Financial risk management The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity and funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages.
a Liquidity and funding risk The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations at a reasonable price as they fall due: The Groups funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources off ering suffi cient headroom, maturity and exibility and cost eff ectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Marks and Spencer plc is nanced by a combination of retained pro ts, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
Operating subsidiaries are nanced by a combination of retained pro ts, bank borrowings and intercompany loans.
At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.325bn set to mature on 28 September 2018.
This facility contains only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, rents payable and exceptional items : to interest plus rents payable.
The covenant is measured semi-annually.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 100m last year 80m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of 225m last year 234m was drawn under the committed facilities and nil last year 23m was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of 3bn, of which 1.1bn last year 1.1bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.

Standard & Poors equivalent rating shown as reference to the majority credit rating of the counterparty from either Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch where applicable.
Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to Treasury policy.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 129m last year 128m, other receivables 110m last year 136m, cash and cash equivalents 206m last year 182m and derivatives 194m last year 54m.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate, hedge cover can be taken out for longer than 18 months, with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 1,591m last year 1,600m with a weighted average maturity date of seven months last year six months.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 28 March 2015 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 16 months last year 16 months from the balance sheet date.
The Group also holds a number of cross-currency swaps to re-designate its xed rate US dollar debt to xed rate sterling debt.
These are reported as cash ow hedges.
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures.
As at the balance sheet date 144m of currency debt last year 162m of derivatives and HK$1,398m last year HK$698m of derivatives were hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 412m last year 417m.

These rates are for periods between one and six months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases, the xed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.3% last year 5.3% and the weighted average time for which the rate is xed is eight years last year nine years.
d Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to sterling, US dollar and euro variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of xed and oating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash ow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date, xed rate borrowings amounted to 1,321.2m last year 1,233.1m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, amounting to 66% last year 59% of the Groups gross borrowings.
The eff ective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2015 2014 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 0.9 1.0 Medium-term notes 5.3 5.3 Finance leases 4.1 4.3 Derivative financial instruments 2015 2014 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Current Forward foreign exchange contracts cash ow hedges 114.8 7.2 12.1 50.9 held for trading 3.1 0.4 1.6 0.6 net investment hedges 0.1 117.9 7.7 13.7 51.5 Non-current Cross-currency swaps cash ow hedges 6.3 19.9 62.3 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash ow hedges 7.3 0.1 0.3 0.9 Interest rate swaps fair value hedge 38.5 17.9 12.2 Embedded derivative see note 5 23.7 22.4 75.8 20.0 40.6 75.4 The Group holds a number of interest rate swaps to re-designate its sterling xed debt to oating debt.

The ineff ective portion recognised in the pro t or loss that arises from fair value hedges amounts to 0.3m last year 0.5m as the loss on the hedged item was 33.5m last year 33.7m gain and the gain on the hedging instrument was 33.8m last year 34.2m loss.
117 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to the Groups financial instruments.
The directors consider that a 2% - last year 2% movement in interest rates and a 20% - last year 20% weakening in sterling against the relevant currency represents a reasonable possible change.
However this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign exchange risk is hedged.
Interest rates: the impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates re ects the eff ect on the Groups oating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity re ects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross-currency swaps.
Foreign exchange: the impact from foreign exchange movements re ects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash ow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully off set by the re-translation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.

OUR PERFORMANCE OUR BUSINESS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE 118 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2: not traded in an active market but the fair values are based on quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
The Groups Level 2 financial instruments include interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.
Fair value is calculated using discounted cash ow methodology, future cash ows are estimated based on forward exchange rates and interest rates from observable market curves and contract rates, discounted at a rate that re ects the credit risk of the various counterparties for those with a long maturity.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a signi cant eff ect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of the embedded derivative is calculated using an option valuation model based on the present value of a 35-year lease with annual lease payments increasing by Retail Price Index RPI, capped and oored at 1.5% and 2.5% respectively and then discounted back to the valuation date.
The valuation is sensitive to changes in RPI.

Capital policy The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns for shareholders and to maintain an effi cient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so the Groups strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating, to operate within a net debt EBITDA ratio of 2.0x-1.5x and to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure financial stability and exibility.
To achieve this strategy the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash ow to net debt see note 27 and xed charge cover to maintain this position.
In addition, the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom with a diverse and balanced long-term debt maturity pro le.
As at the balance sheet date the Groups average debt maturity pro le was eight years last year nine years.
During the year the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 stable with Moodys and BBBstable with Standard & Poors.
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
