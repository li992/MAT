What we have audited The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts the Annual Report, comprise: the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2015: the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended: the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended: the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended: and the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identied as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach Overview Overall group materiality: 70 million 2014: 70 million which is 4.7% 2014: 5.5% of Operating Materiality profit before tax.
Based on the outputs of our risk assessment, along with our understanding of the Legal & General structure, we performed full scope audits of components which, using our professional judgement, we considered Audit scope significant within the following segments: Legal & General Retirement LGR, Legal & General Investment Management LGIM, Insurance, Savings and Legal & General America LGA.
In addition, specic audit procedures on investments and investment returns were performed within Areas of the Legal & General Capital LGC segment.
focus Our risk assessment analysis identied the following as areas of focus: Valuation of non-participating insurance liabilities retirement: Valuation of participating and non-participating insurance liabilities protection: and Valuation of complex financial investments commercial loans and CDOs.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identied as areas of focus in the table below.
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specic areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.
This is not a complete list of all risks identied by our audit.

We focused on this area because the provision for the settlement of future claims for retirement products is significant in size and its estimation involves complex and subjective judgement about future events, both internal and external to the business, for which small changes in assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities.
Key assumption areas are: Valuation interest rate the discount rate derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liability used in calculating the present value of annuity and benefit payments.
The discount rate also includes an explicit allowance for future default and reinvestment risk on the asset portfolio: and Longevity how long the policyholders receiving annuity payments are expected to live and how that might change over time.
Our audit effort covered these key assumptions.
We focused a greater amount of effort where either of the assumptions changed in the period or where we considered, based on the annual analysis of longevity experience, that the assumptions or methodology needed to be reconsidered.
Valuation interest rate The valuation interest rate is the asset-based interest The work we performed to address the risks over determination of the valuation interest rate rate that is used to discount the liability cashows to included the following procedures: present value.

On a sample basis, we tested the credit ratings used to estimate the default allowance back to independent third-party credit rating sources.
Where internally generated ratings were used, we assessed the rating model and the methodology using specialist treasury expertise and tested the inputs by comparing it to third-party data.
Model changes leading to calculation errors We obtained an understanding and assessed the appropriateness of changes to the actuarial process or model underlying the calculation of the interest rate by understanding the governance process in place around changes to models, testing the controls in place to check that changes were applied appropriately, and comparing the outcome of the change to our independent expectation.

| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Valuation of participating and non-participating insurance liabilities protection Refer to the Audit Committee Report and Note 1 to the financial statements for the Directors disclosures of the basis of preparation and use of estimates and Notes 19, 20 and 21 for related accounting policies and further information on judgements and estimates.
We focused on this area because the participating and non-participating insurance liabilities for protection products in the UK are significant in size and their estimation is inherently judgemental.
The valuation of insurance liabilities for protection is sensitive to: persistency the rate at which policies are retained over time and therefore continue to contribute premium income: and mortality and morbidity the rate at which policyholders die or suffer critical illness.
Persistency assumptions Using our actuarial specialists, we assessed the results of the experience analysis carried out The rate at which policyholders cease protection by the group for the protection business to determine whether they provided support for the products is projected using the groups historical assumptions used.
In undertaking our assessment we took account of the potential for future experience and assumptions experience analysis changes in experience arising from regulatory changes.

We evaluated the design and implementation as well as testing the operating effectiveness of controls over accuracy and completeness of the data used in the experience analysis and found them to be effective.
We also agreed data back to policy documentation and claims history.
We compared the groups persistency assumptions with those adopted by other insurers using our own independent industry benchmarking survey.
Persistency assumptions are inherently subjective, particularly in light of recent regulatory changes.
However, we found that the assumptions used were reasonable in the context of the groups products.
Mortality and morbidity assumptions We evaluated the design and implementation as well as tested the operating effectiveness of The estimates of the amount and timing of benefit controls over accuracy and completeness of the data used in the experience analysis and found payments is projected using current base mortality them to be effective.

the UK regulatory rules for insurance provisions.
Having performed our work we found the assumptions used in the models to be appropriate.
We found that the methodologies and models used are in line with the prior year and industry standards, whilst reecting the nature of the groups protection business.
Valuation of complex financial investments Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 1 to the financial statements for the directors disclosures of the basis of preparation and use of estimates and Note 12 for related accounting policies and further information on judgements and estimates for investment risks.
The groups financial investments enable it to support its insurance liabilities and meet regulatory capital requirements, as well as providing returns on shareholder assets the assets available for distribution to shareholders after taking account of policyholder liabilities, including associated guarantees, options and bonuses.
Most of the groups financial investments are valued by reference to prices on active markets.
However, some are priced by reference to market data and or valuation models.
They vary in complexity depending on the nature of the investments.
Investments that are complex to value and require the use of significant judgement include commercial loans and collateralised debt obligations CDOs.
We focused on the valuation of commercial loans For the valuation of complex investments, we assessed both the methodology and and CDOs because they are significant in size and assumptions used by management in the calculation of the year end values as well as testing changes in estimates could result in material changes the governance controls that the group has in place to monitor these processes.
We did not identify any defective controls.
For commercial loans, we: Key estimates used in the valuation models reect tested the calculation in the discounted cash ow models for accuracy: observable data such as forward interest rates, foreign agreed the factual inputs to underlying contracts: exchange rates and forward ination rate curves, as well as unobservable inputs such as future cash ows compared the market observable inputs to published data: and, and expected defaults.
agreed the non-market observable inputs to calculations or supporting documents and considered whether they were in line with our expectations.
We also focused on the disclosure related to these complex financial instruments, which is extensive.
We did not identify any material exceptions in our testing and the inputs to all models tested were found to be in line with our expectations.
For CDOs, we: obtained independent conrmation from the counterparties for all outstanding positions and associated collateral: re-priced the collateral to independent external third party sources: read the report from and met with the directors external valuation expert to understand their objectivity, qualications, approach, and their findings: and compared the internal price, the counterparty price and directors experts price and investigated differences over a tolerance based on the component materiality.
We did not identify any material exceptions in our testing of the conrmations, the collateral, or the comparison of different estimates of the prices.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 96 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditors report to the members of Legal & General Group Plc continued Report on the group financial statements continued How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the scale and nature of the groups operations, the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.
Using the outputs of a risk assessment, along with our understanding of the group, we scoped our audit based on the signicance of the results and financial position of individual markets relative to the group result and financial position.
In doing so, we considered qualitative factors and ensured that we obtained sufficient coverage across all financial statement line items in the consolidated financial statements.
We determined the type of work that needed to be performed for each component by us as the group engagement team, component audit teams within PwC UK and from other PwC network rms under our instructions.
The group reports in six reportable segments: LGR, LGIM, LGC, Insurance, Savings and LGA.
Based on the outputs of our risk assessment, along with our understanding of the Legal & General structure, we performed full scope audits of components which, using our professional judgement, we considered significant within the following segments: LGR, LGIM, Insurance, Savings and LGA.
We performed specic audit procedures on the significant investment and investment return balances within the LGC segment.
Where work was performed by auditors of the components, we determined the level of involvement we needed as the group audit team to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
The group audit team kept in regular communication with component audit teams through on-site visits, regular phone calls, discussions and written instructions, as appropriate.
Materiality The scope of our audit was inuenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall group materiality 70 million 2014: 70 million.
How we determined it Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole of 70 million which represents 4.7% of operating profit before tax 2014: 5.5%.
Rationale for benchmark applied In determining materiality, we considered financial metrics which we believed to be relevant, and concluded, consistent with last year that operating profit before tax was the most relevant benchmark because it reects the underlying profit of the business.
While this is not an IFRS measure of profit, it is reconciled to IFRS profit before tax in the financial statements and is one of the key metrics used by the group in running its business.
Whilst overall materiality was assessed with reference to operating profit before tax, we compared our materiality level against other relevant benchmarks, such as total assets, total revenue and IFRS profit before tax in order to ensure the materiality benchmark selected was appropriate for our audit.
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was 12 million 60 million.
Certain components that produce their own audited financial statements were audited to a local statutory audit materiality which was less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identied during our audit above 3.5 million 2014: 3.5 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors statement, set out on pages 242 to 245, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs UK & Ireland we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the directors statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the groups ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the directors As explained more fully in the Directors Responsibilities Statement set out on page 245, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs UK & Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 105 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation Legal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom UK, together with its subsidiaries transacts life assurance and long-term savings business, investment management and most classes of general insurance and health business through its subsidiaries and associates in the UK, the United States and other countries throughout the world.
significant accounting policies The group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The group financial statements also comply with IFRS and interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB as adopted by the European Union.
The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash ows for a reporting period.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
Accounting policies that relate specically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis.
Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or IFRIC interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 or later periods but which the group has not adopted early.
Details of these are contained within Note 12 Financial investments and Investment property, Note 22 Investment contract liabilities and Note 44 Commitments.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly signicantly.
This is particularly relevant for the determination of fair values of level 3 investments, particularly investment property Note 12 and unquoted and illiquid financial investments Note 12 iv, and the estimation of insurance and investment contract liabilities, particularly interest rate, credit default and mortality assumptions Notes 19 to 22.
The basis of accounting for these areas, and the significant judgements used in determining them, are outlined in the respective notes to the financial statements.
Consolidation principles Subsidiary undertakings The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash ows of the company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the group directly or indirectly when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee Note 46. profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
The interests of parties, other than the group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classied as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders Note 12 v in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Associates and joint ventures The group has interests in associates and joint ventures Note 47 which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity partnerships, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities.
In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, Investments in associates, these interests have been classied as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Associates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost.
The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reect the groups share of the profit or loss after the date of the acquisition.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 106 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation continued Product classication The groups products are classied for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts participating and non-participating or investment contracts participating and non-participating.
The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 21 and 22 respectively.
Fiduciary activities Assets associated with duciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements.
Where the group acts in a duciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.
Foreign exchange and exchange rates Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
The functional currency of the groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The assets and liabilities of all of the groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the groups presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet.
The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash ow or net investment hedges.
The year end exchange rates at 31 December 2015 were 1.47 United States Dollar, 1.36 Euro at 31 December 2014: 1.56 United States Dollar, 1.29 Euro.
The average exchange rates for year ended 31 December 2015 were 1.53 United States Dollar, 1.38 Euro year ended 31 December 2014: 1.65 United States Dollar, 1.24 Euro.

The profit loss before tax reects profit loss before tax attributable to equity holders.
Group debt costs exclude interest on non recourse nancing.
Group investment projects and expenses include restructuring costs of 50m 2014: 31m.
The equity holders effective tax rate for the year is 19.3% 2014: 19.9%.
The groups effective tax rate remains slightly below the UK corporation tax rate due to differences between the measurement of accounting and taxable profits.
This supplementary operating profit information one of the groups key performance indicators provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and the group believes it provides shareholders with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 107 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED LGR represents worldwide annuities both individual and bulk purchase, longevity insurance and lifetime mortgages.
The LGIM segment represents institutional and retail investment management and workplace savings businesses.
LGC represents the medium-term investment return less expenses on group invested assets, using assumptions applied to the average balance of group invested assets including interest bearing intra-group balances.
Insurance represents business in retail protection, group protection, general insurance, networks, Legal & General France LGF sold on 31 December 2015 and Legal & General Netherlands LGN.
Savings represents business in platforms, SIPPs, mature savings, with-profits and emerging markets.
The LGA segment comprises protection business written in the USA.
Following changes to the organisational structure, Insurance and Savings are now reported as separate segments.
Previously, Insurance and Savings had been reported together as the LGAS segment.
In addition, the workplace savings business is now included in the LGIM segment.
workplace savings had previously been recognised in the Savings LGAS segment.
Comparatives have been amended accordingly in line with this reclassication.
The impact of the workplace savings reclassication has been to reduce LGIM 2014 operating profit by 15m, with an offsetting increase in the Savings segments operating profit.
Operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes and exceptional items.
Operating profit therefore reects longer-term economic assumptions for the groups insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except for LGA which excludes unrealised investment returns to align with the liability measurement under US GAAP.
Variances between actual and smoothed investment return assumptions are reported below operating profit.
Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition, start-up and closure costs, are also excluded from operating profit.
ii Reconciliation of operational cash to operating profit before tax The table below provides an analysis of the operational cash generation by each of the groups business segments, together with a reconciliation to operating profit before tax.
Operational cash generation includes dividends remitted from LGF of 1m 2014: 2m and LGN of 28m 2014: 29m within the Insurance line and LGA of 54m 2014: 46m.
2. International and other includes 40m 2014: 25m of restructuring costs 50m before tax 2014: 31m before tax within the Group investment projects and expenses line.
LGIM includes the workplace savings business which was previously reported in Savings.
Prior year comparatives have been amended.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 108 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 2 Supplementary operating profit information continued ii Reconciliation of operational cash to operating profit before tax continued Operational cash generation for LGR, LGIM, Insurance and Savings represents the expected surplus generated in the year from the in-force non profit annuities, workplace savings, protection and savings businesses using best estimate assumptions.
The LGIM operational cash generation also includes operating profit after tax from the institutional and retail investment management businesses.
The Insurance operational cash generation also includes dividends remitted from LGF and LGN and operating profit after tax from general insurance and the remaining Insurance businesses.
The Savings operational cash generation also includes the shareholders share of bonuses on with-profits business and operating profit after tax from the remaining Savings businesses.
New business surplus strain for LGR, LGIM, Insurance and Savings represents the cost of acquiring new business and setting up regulatory reserves in respect of the new business for UK non profit annuities, workplace savings, protection and savings, net of tax.
The new business surplus strain and operational cash generation for LGR, LGIM, Insurance and Savings exclude the required solvency margin from the liability calculation.
Net cash generation for LGR, LGIM, Insurance and Savings is dened as operational cash generation less new business strain.
Operational cash generation and net cash for LGC represents the operating profit net of tax.
The operational cash generation for LGA represents the dividends received.
See Note iii for more detail on experience variances, assumption changes and non-cash items.
Operational cash generation includes dividends remitted from LGF of 2m and LGN of 29m within the Insurance line and LGA of 46m.
2. International and other includes 25m of restructuring costs 31m before tax within the Group investment projects and expenses line.

Savings excludes the workplace savings business which is now reported in LGIM.
Prior period comparatives have been amended.
The impact on the Savings comparatives is the increase of net cash generation by 16m and the increase of operating profit by 15m.
Offsetting movements have been reected in the LGIM segment.
The Other LGR experience variance reects the benefit to profit of selective longevity and asset reinsurance related to bulk annuity transactions, offset by other smaller experience variances.
The Insurance persistency valuation assumption change reects continued improvement in retail protection lapse rates.
The mortality morbidity valuation assumption change in LGR primarily reects late retirement factor assumption changes and a change in mortality reserving assumptions in relation to unreported deaths of deferred annuitants.
The Insurance mortality morbidity valuation assumption change has arisen on the strengthening of the reserving basis on the Whole Life Protection Product to reect the current expectation of future mortality improvement on this business.
The LGR and Insurance positive expense valuation assumption changes represents the continued operational efficiency reducing the existing business cost base.
The reinsurance modelling for our UK protection business has been enhanced.
Recent reinsurance contracts have been written on a risk premium basis as opposed to level premium and the model change ensures that for these treaties, sufficient prudence is being held in later years.
The one-off impact reduced operating profit by 93m in 2015.
This also defers a higher proportion of cash generation into the later years of these reinsurance contracts.
Net cash for Insurance and Savings recognises tax relief from prior year acquisition expenses, which are spread evenly over seven years under relevant I-E tax legislation in the period the cash ows actually occur.
In contrast, operating profit typically recognises the value of these future cash ows in the same period as the underlying expense as deferred tax amounts.
The reconciling amounts arising from these items are included in the table above.
Following the removal of new retail protection business from the I-E tax regime, and the removal of commission from new insured savings business under the Retail Distribution Review at the end of 2012, no material amount of deferred tax assets arise on new acquisition expenses and the value of these future cash ows for post-2013 acquisition expenses have been reected within net cash.
The residual prior year acquisition expenses will run off predictably to 2018.
The DAC in Savings represents the amortisation charges offset by new acquisition costs deferred in the year.
The DIL reects initial fees on insured savings business which relate to the future provision of services and are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which these services are provided.

2015 investment variance is negative primarily driven by below expected equity performance and a dened pension benefit scheme variance of 15 m 2014: 40m, that reects the actuarial losses and gains and valuation differences arising on annuity assets held by dened benefit pension schemes that have been purchased from Legal & General Assurance Society Limited Society.
M&A related includes gains and losses, expenses and intangible amortisation relating to acquisitions and disposals.
2015 includes the 25m net loss resulting from the disposal of subsidiary and joint venture investments during the year.
Other includes new business start-up costs and other non-investment related variance items.
3 Other operational income and expense Operational income comprises fee income from estate agency operations, agency fee income relating to distribution services and revenue of 640m 2014: 628m from consolidated private equity investments.

5 Earnings per share Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the groups profit allocated to each outstanding share.
It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is dened as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the company, derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.

| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 113 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT 7 Principal products A significant part of the groups business involves the acceptance and management of risk.
A description of the principal products offered by the groups segments is outlined below.
The group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the board.
The groups risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 42 to 47.
Details of the risks associated with the groups principal products and the control techniques used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 8 and 18.
LGF was disposed of in the year as referred to in Note 30.
LGF primarily wrote unit linked savings, including shares in open ended investment vehicles SICAVs, risks for which are borne by unit holders of these funds, Euro denominated funds with a 100% profit sharing clause and bank based investment accounts.
LGR Annuity contracts Annuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment.
No surrender value is available under any of these products.
Immediate and deferred annuity contracts are offered.
Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.
The income stream from a deferred annuity is delayed until a specified future date.
Bulk annuities are also offered, where the group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund, predominantly to UK clients, but also for US, Dutch and Irish clients.
A small portfolio of immediate annuities has been written as participating business.
Some non-participating deferred annuities sold by the group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.
The value of such guaranteed options are currently immaterial.
There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non profit business with benets linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases.
In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative.
The total of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2015 was 572m 2014: 524m.
Thus, 1% negative ination, which was reversed in the following year, would result in a guarantee cost of approximately 6m 2014: 5m.
Negative ination sustained over a longer period would give rise to signicantly greater guarantee costs.
Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative ination hedges and limited price indexation swaps.
The group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed level of income over a chosen xed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder.
The products can provide a xed lump sum at maturity and or options to surrender on non-guaranteed terms.
The group has written some deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum pensions.
These options expose the group to interest rate and longevity risk as the cost would be expected to increase with decreasing interest rates and improved longevity.
The market consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 176m 2014: 196m.
Longevity insurance contracts The group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return.
Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.
Lifetime mortgages Lifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, without the need for regular repayments.
They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 60 through specialist intermediaries.
Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due.
All Lifetime mortgages provide a no negative equity guarantee, which means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the group will accept the net sale proceeds as full settlement.
LGIM LGIM offers both active and passive management on either a pooled or segregated basis.
Assets are managed on behalf of pension funds, institutional clients, sovereign wealth clients, retail funds and subsidiary companies within the group.
The core products are set out below.
Index fund management LGIM provides a diversied range of pooled index funds, providing a wide choice and the ability to pursue specic benchmarks efficiently.
In addition, segregated solutions are offered to institutional clients providing large scale customisation against established market capitalisation weighted and alternative indices.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 114 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 7 Principal products continued Active xed income and liquidity management A range of pooled and segregated active xed income funds.
The LGIM liquidity funds offer institutional investors a solution for their cash management requirements across a range of core currencies.
The liquidity funds aim to deliver competitive returns with a high level of diversication, whilst focusing on capital preservation through portfolios of high quality, liquid assets.
Solutions and Liability Driven Investment LDI A range of pooled and bespoke solutions to help fide-risk dened benefit pension schemes.
These solutions will usually combine active or passive underlying portfolios with derivative overlays designed to meet clients specic requirements.
Solutions also includes a range of pooled multi-asset funds for retail and institutional clients, built using LGIMs expertise in asset allocation which is informed by an in-house research capability.
The underlying asset classes may be managed on an active or passive basis within LGIM.
An allocation strategy service is also offered to institutional clients, which may also allocate some of the portfolio to managers other than LGIM.
Active equity An active equity management business comprising focused teams managing stock selection across different regions.
Property A range of pooled or segregated real estate funds for both UK and overseas investors, offered via a mixture of pooled funds, specialist funds and partnerships.
The business is based around in-house sector specialists with a dedicated research team.
LGC Legal & General Capital LGC actively invests the groups balance sheet and improves shareholder returns through increasing exposure to direct investments and the efficient management of the groups traded portfolio.
Investment strategy and implementation LGC manages a diversied portfolio of shareholder assets that include global equities, property, bonds and other direct investments not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders.
The potential volatility is managed using performance benchmarks, foreign exchange and equity derivative hedging and portfolio diversication to limit investment variance and concentrations of exposures by asset type, sector and geographic region.
Direct investments and structuring Direct investments are an increasingly important part of the groups growth strategy and cover a diverse set of assets such as loans made directly to European SMEs, a property purchase or an equity stake in a private company.
LGC invests in direct investments to achieve better risk adjusted returns, provide diversity to its traded market portfolio and develop synergies with other parts of the groups business.
There is currently a sector focus on housing, urban regeneration, clean energy and alternate finance.
INSURANCE Insurance business comprises retail and group protection, general insurance products and the Netherlands business LGN.
Protection business retail and group The group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benets.
They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benets: these additional benets are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately.
The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms.
Some sickness benets cover the policyholders mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates.
In addition to these benets, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benets and offer policyholders conversion options.
General insurance The group offers Household and Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU products: Household.
These contracts provide cover in respect of policyholders homes, investment properties, contents, personal belongings and incidental liabilities which they may incur as a property owner, occupier and individual.
Exposure is normally limited to the rebuilding cost of the home, the replacement cost of belongings and a policy limit in respect of liability claims.
These contracts provide cover in respect of continuing payment liabilities incurred by customers when they are unable to work as a result of accident, sickness or unemployment.
They protect predominantly mortgage payments.
Exposure is limited to the monthly payment level selected by the customer sufficient to cover the payment and associated costs, up to the duration limit specified in the policy, usually 12 months.
In addition, there are portfolios of Motor Insurance administered but not underwritten and Domestic Mortgage Indemnity Insurance DMI in run-off.
Since 1993, the DMI contract included a maximum period of cover of ten years, and a cap on the maximum claim.
For business accepted prior to 1993, cover is unlimited and lasts until the insured property is remortgaged or redeemed.
The group also sells pet insurance products.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 115 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Legal & General Netherlands LGN In addition to protection products, LGN also write savings business, which includes unit linked and index linked savings products, bank based investment accounts and corporate pension products.
Certain savings products include an exposure to interest rate and credit risk, managed through an active asset-liability management programme.
SAVINGS A range of contracts are offered in a variety of different forms to meet customers long-term savings objectives.
Policyholders may choose to include a number of protection benets within their savings contracts.
Typically, any guarantees under the contract would only apply on maturity or earlier death.
On certain older contracts there may be provisions guaranteeing surrender benets.
Savings contracts may or may not guarantee policyholders an investment return.
The contracts fall into three main types: Non-participating savings, pensions and endowment contracts: Participating savings business, comprising endowment contracts and with-profits bonds: and Unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products.
For unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders and therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented in respect of the associated assets and liabilities.
Unit linked business is written in the Society with-profits fund.
Collective investment business is administered by Legal & General Portfolio Management Services Limited.
Pensions individual and corporate These are long-term savings contracts through which policyholders accumulate pension benets.
Some older contracts contain a basic guaranteed benefit expressed as an amount of pension payable or a guaranteed annuity option.
Other options provided by these contracts include an open market option on maturity, early retirement and late retirement.
The group would generally have discretion over the terms on which the latter types of options are offered.
Endowment policies These contracts provide a lump sum on maturity determined by the addition of annual and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a minimum sum assured death benefit.
With-profits bonds These contracts provide an investment return to the policyholder which is determined by the attribution of regular and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a death benefit, typically of 101% of the value of the units allocated to the policyholder.
Participating contracts The with-profits fund ceased writing new business on 31 January 2015.
Only increases to existing pension policies and new members to existing Group Personal Pension Schemes, where allowed for in the policy terms and conditions, have been accepted after that date.
Regular premiums in payment at the date of closure will also continue to be accepted.
Sales of new with-profits bonds were suspended in January 2014 before closing with-profits bonds to increments at the end of December 2014.
Discretionary increases to benets on participating contracts are allowed in one or both of annual and final bonus form.
These bonuses are determined in accordance with the principles outlined in the Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM for the management of the with-profits fund.
The principles include: The with-profits fund will be managed with the objective of ensuring that its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities without the need for additional capital: Bonus rates will be smoothed so that some of the short-term uctuations in the value of the investments of the with-profits fund and the business results achieved in the with-profits fund are not immediately reected in payments under with-profits policies: and Some older participating contracts include a guaranteed minimum rate of roll up of the policyholders fund up to the date of retirement or maturity.
The inherited estate is the excess of assets held within the with-profits fund over and above the amount required to meet liabilities, including those which arise from the regulatory duty to treat customers fairly in settling discretionary benets.
Following the closure of the with-profit sub fund, the board will consider annually whether part of the inherited estate should be distributed to with-profits policyholders.
In adverse circumstances this may result in a deduction from investment returns in order to increase the value of the inherited estate.
The amount and timing of any distribution from or deduction to increase the inherited estate shall be determined by the Board.
Following this approach, the Board has agreed a charge of 0.2% in respect of changes in the cost of guarantees and options to be made as part of the 2015 bonus declaration.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 116 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 7 Principal products continued The distribution of surplus to shareholders depends upon the bonuses declared for the year.
Typically, bonus rates are set having regard to investment returns, although the group has some discretion setting rates and would normally smooth bonuses over time.
The volatility of investment returns could impact the funds capital position and its ability to pay bonuses.
If future investment conditions were less favourable than anticipated, the lower bonus levels resulting would also reduce future distributions to shareholders.
The unallocated divisible surplus in the fund would normally be expected to absorb the impact of these investment risks.
Only in extreme scenarios, where shareholders were required to provide support to the with-profits fund to meet its liabilities, would these risks affect equity.
As part of the 2007 with-profit fund restructure, the 1996 sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
As a result, Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment reduced to 100m at the end of 2015 and will then gradually reduce to zero by the end of 2017.
LGA Protection business Protection consists of individual term assurance, which provides death benets over the medium to long term.
The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter.
During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract.
After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.
Universal life Universal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benets over the medium to long term.
The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate.
LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate.
LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.
The reserves for universal life totalled $625m 424m at 31 December 2015 2014: $653m 419m.
The guaranteed interest rates associated with those reserves ranged from 1.5% to 6% 2014: 1.5% to 6%, with the majority of the policies having guaranteed rates ranging from 3% to 4% 2014: 3% to 4%.

Market risk Exposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of uctuations in the value of, or income from, specic assets.
Credit risk Exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the group.
Liquidity risk The risk that the group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.

The illiquid forms of investment, with limited secondary lifetime group, however, sets limits on the overall exposure to illiquid investment markets to realise the value of assets outside mortgages types taking account of the nature and type of liabilities that the assets are agreed redemption terms.
The group seeks to manage its funds and liquidity requirements on a pooled basis and to ensure the group maintains sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent estimate of its net cash outows.
In addition, it ensures that, even under plausible but unlikely severe conditions, the group has access to the funds necessary to cover all outgoings such as surrenders, withdrawals and maturing liabilities.
As at 31 December 2015, the group had in place a 1.00bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in December 2020.
This facility replaced the syndicated facility totalling 1.00bn, of which 0.04bn was due to mature in October 2017 and 0.96bn was due to mature in October 2018.
No drawings were made under either facility during 2015.
LGA has similar risks to the UK protection business and controls to mitigate significant risks.
9 Assets analysis The group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and credit risks.
The four categorisations presented are: Unit linked For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
Unit linked business is written in both Society and Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The group is, therefore, not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.
As a result, risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.
With-profits Policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits fund.
The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the fund and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year.
The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and xed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
The with-profits classication excludes unit linked contracts.
Non profit non-unit linked Shareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business held in the UK with-profits fund, which comprise of annuities, protection and non profit savings products.

The value of business acquired represents the present value of anticipated future profits in acquired contracts.
These amounts are amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
Intangible assets acquired via business combinations, such as the value of customer relationships, are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised over their useful life in line with the expected emergence of profit from the business.
Where software costs are separately identiable and measurable they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life.
Purchased interest in long-term businesses and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

These are accounted for in line with the appropriate accounting standards as follows: Long-term insurance business Acquisition costs comprise direct costs, such as initial commission, and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
Acquisition costs relating to non-participating insurance contracts written outside the with-profits fund which are incurred during a financial year are deferred by use of an asset which is amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable, and in accordance with the expected incidence of future related margins.
For participating contracts, acquisition costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
General insurance A proportion of commission and other acquisition costs relating to unearned premiums is carried forward as deferred acquisition costs or, in respect of reinsurance outwards, as deferred income.
Investment contracts For participating investment contracts, acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as initial commission and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
These costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
For non-participating investment contracts, only directly attributable costs relating to investment management services which vary with, and are related to, securing new contracts and renewing existing contracts, are capitalised and amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable from future revenue.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.

| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 125 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 12 Financial investments and investment property The group holds financial investments and investment property to back insurance contracts on behalf of policyholders and as group capital.
The group classies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading HFT, designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available-for-sale AFS or loans and receivables.
Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.
The groups policy is to measure investments at FVTPL except for certain overseas assets where the related liability is valued on a passive basis not using current information, in which case investments are classied as AFS.
All derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classied as HFT.
Certain financial investments held by the group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the groups investment strategy.
Assets designated as FVTPL include debt securities including lifetime mortgages and equity instruments which would otherwise have been classied as AFS or loans and receivables under IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Assets backing participating and non-participating policyholder liabilities outside the US are designated as FVTPL.
For participating contracts the assets are managed on a fair value basis to maximise the total return to policyholders over the contract life.
The groups non-participating investment contract liabilities outside of the US are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial investments are based on bid prices, which management believe to be representative of fair value.
If the market for a financial investment is not active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques such as recent arms length transactions, consensus market pricing, reference to similar listed investments, discounted cash ow models or option pricing models.
Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, which represent current best practice, developed by the Association Franais des Investisseurs en Capital, the British Venture Capital Association and the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.
The techniques used for determining fair value include earnings multiples, the price of a recent investment or a net asset basis.
Financial investments classied as HFT and FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reected in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Financial investments classied as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity.
Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are reected in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus acquisition costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return.
Investment property in the UK is valued bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period.
Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualied professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reect any material changes in fair value.
The group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of various transactions, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions.
The amount and type of collateral required where the group receives collateral depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.
Collateral received in the form of cash, where the group has contractual rights to receive the cash ows generated, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability for its repayment.
Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the counterparty defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 126 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 12 Financial investments and investment property continued Non-cash collateral pledged where the group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash ows generated is not derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.
Cash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash ows generated, is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable is recognised for its return.
Future developments In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial instruments which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU endorsement and the IASBs consideration of its exposure draft, Applying IFRS 9 Financial instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance contracts.
On adoption, IFRS 9 contains three key elements: A principle-based model for classication and measurement of financial instruments driven by cash ow characteristics and the business model in which an asset is held.
Financial assets are classied under either amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or fair value through profit and loss: A single expected loss impairment model that will require more timely recognition of expected credit losses on assets classied as amortised cost or FVOCI.
Specically, the new Standard requires entities to account for expected credit losses from when financial instruments are first recognised, and it lowers the threshold for recognition of full lifetime expected losses: and A  model for hedge accounting with enhanced disclosures about risk management activities, enabling entities to better reect these activities in their financial statements.
The impact of IFRS 9 on the groups financial statements will depend on the interaction of the asset classication and measurement with the insurance contract measurement at the date of transition, particularly for liabilities which are measured using locked in discount rates.
Given the IASBs consideration of deferral of IFRS 9 for certain insurance companies, the group does not intend to early adopt this Standard.

These holdings include 1,000m 2014: 994m relating to four CDOs that were constructed in 2007 and 2008 in accordance with terms specified by Legal & General as part of a strategic review of the assets backing the annuity portfolio.
The group selected at outset and manages the reference portfolios underlying the CDOs to give exposure to globally diversied portfolios of investment grade corporate bonds.
The group is able to substitute the constituents of the original reference portfolios with new reference assets, allowing the management of the underlying credit risk although there have been no substitutions in 2014 or 2015.
A breakdown of the underlying CDO reference portfolio by sector is provided below: 2015 2014 Sector % % Banks 14 14 Utilities 10 10 Consumer Services and Goods 25 25 Financial Services 6 6 Technology and Telecoms 9 9 Insurance 6 6 Industrials 20 20 Oil and Gas 6 6 Health Care 4 4 100 100 The CDOs are termed as super senior since default losses on the reference portfolio have to exceed 27.5%, on average across the four CDOs, before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Assuming an average recovery rate of 30%, over 39% of the reference names would have to default before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Beyond 27.5% of default losses on the reference portfolio, losses to the CDO would occur at a rate that is a multiple of the loss rate on the reference portfolio.
For illustration, a 200m loss could be incurred if default losses to the reference portfolios exceeded 30.4% or if 43.5% of the names in the reference portfolio defaulted with an average 30% recovery rate.
All gures are averages across the four CDOs.
The underlying reference portfolio has had no reference entity defaults in 2014 or 2015.
Losses are limited under the terms of the CDOs to assets and collateral invested.
These CDOs also incorporate features under which, in certain circumstances, the group can choose either to post additional cash collateral or to allow wind up of the structures.
These features are dependent on the portfolios weighted average spreads, default experience to date and time to maturity.
No additional collateral was posted to any of the CDOs during 2015 2014: nil.
During 2015, the group received nil 2014: nil of previously posted collateral.
The amount of the cash equivalent collateral attached to CDOs during the year is nil 2014: nil.
These CDOs are valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTraxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
This is then validated against the internal valuation.
Unit linked CDOs are excluded from the analysis as the risk is retained by the policyholders.

iv Fair value hierarchy Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reect the groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are dened as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the groups level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources, such as iBoxx, IDC and Bloomberg, which use mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, except for bespoke CDOs and swaps holdings see below.
In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices.
Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classied them as level 2.
The CDOs are valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTraxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
Accordingly, these assets have also been classied in level 2.
The groups policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time.
There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2015 2014: nil.

In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the group has classied within level 3.
The group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash ows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the groups credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data, as well as the best information about the individual financial instrument.
Illiquid market conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the groups financial instruments.
As a result, there is generally no or limited observable market data for these assets and liabilities.
Fair value estimates for financial instruments deemed to be in an illiquid market are based on judgements regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.
These fair values are estimates and involve considerable uncertainty and variability as a result of the inputs selected and may differ signicantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.
As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realisable in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.
In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique could signicantly affect these fair value estimates.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.
Other financial investments comprise debt securities, lifetime mortgages and derivative assets.
The realised and unrealised gains and losses have been recognised in investment return in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The group holds regular discussions with its pricing providers to determine whether transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy have occurred.
The above transfers occurred as a result of this process.
The Suffolk Life Group was sold in January 2016 and therefore was classied as held for sale at 31 December 2015.

| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 135 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 13 Derivative assets and liabilities The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39 are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash ow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
The groups principal uses of hedge accounting are to: Recognise in shareholders equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Any cumulative gains and or losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the foreign operation: Defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash ow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a rm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur: and Hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate uctuations.
Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction.
The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges between 80% and 125% effectiveness with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, within other expenses, in the current year.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the denition of an insurance contract.
Cash inows and outows are presented on a net basis where the group is required to settle net or has a legally enforceable right of offset and the intention is to settle on a net basis.

Forward foreign exchange contracts net investment hedges Historically, the group hedged part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in its overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
It recognised the portion of the gain or loss which is determined to be an effective hedge through reserves within shareholders equity, along with the gain or loss on translation of the foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts were closed out during 2015.

If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.
Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash ows of assets held at amortised cost or fair value of assets classied as AFS.
Assets which are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The table below provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets which have been impaired and the ageing analysis of financial assets which are past due but not impaired.

Insurance risk is the exposure to loss arising from experience being different to that anticipated.

In exposure to the life expectancy of borrowers.
pricing lifetime mortgage business, account is taken of trends in mortality rates in setting the amounts that are advanced to borrowers relative to the value of the property on which the loan is secured.
Persistency risk Protection The pricing basis for protection business includes provision for policy lapses.
In the early years of a policy, lapses may result and savings Following the adoption of PS06 14 in 2006, the persistency assumption for in a loss to the group, as the acquisition costs non-participating protection business allows for the expected pattern of associated with the contract would not have persistency, adjusted to incorporate a margin for adverse deviation.
Actual been recovered from product margins.
trends in policy lapse rates are monitored with adverse trends being subject to actuarial investigation.
For insured contracts, terms and conditions typically include surrender deductions to mitigate the risk.
In later periods, once the acquisition costs have been recouped, the effect of lapses and surrenders depends upon the relationship between the exit benefit, if any, and the liability for that contract.
Exit benets are not generally guaranteed and the group has some discretion in determining the amount of the payment.
As a result, the effect on profit in later periods is expected to be broadly neutral.
Expense risk Protection, In determining pricing assumptions, account is taken of changes in price indices In pricing long-term insurance business, savings and and the costs of employment, with stress testing used to evaluate the effect of assumptions are made as to the future cost annuities significant deviations.

Quota share and excess of loss reinsurance aggregate claims across the groups portfolio contracts are used by individual and group protection, respectively, to further of protection businesses.
Depending on the nature of an epidemic, mortality experience may lead to a reduction in the cost of claims for annuity business.
Weather events General The impact of events is mitigated by excess of loss catastrophe treaties, under significant weather events such as windstorms insurance which the cost of claims from a weather event in excess of an agreed retention and coastal and river oods can lead to a higher level, is recovered from insurers.
The reinsurance is designed to protect against instance of claims than anticipated.

Other risks Product Controls to mitigate the risk Subsidence General Underwriting criteria for general insurance business includes assessment The incidence of subsidence can have a insurance of subsidence risk, with an appropriate premium being charged for the risk significant impact on the level of claims accepted.
Reinsurance arrangements are used to further mitigate the risk.
The principal risks and associated controls relevant to our LGA business are consistent with those identied for our Insurance, Savings and LGR businesses and therefore have not been repeated here.
Accumulation of risks There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the group.
In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long-term and short-term insurance business written by the group.
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure.
The groups capital model seeks to measure risk correlations particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme.
An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.
Operational risk Operational risk is dened as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events.
Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the groups businesses.
The group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action, or reputational damage.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 150 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 19 Long-term insurance valuation assumptions The groups insurance assumptions, described below, relate exclusively to the UK insurance business.
The non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the groups operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.
i Non-participating business For its non-participating business the group seeks to make prudent assumptions about its future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.
The approach used to set non-participating assumptions is generally similar to that used to determine the assumptions used for PRA statutory Peak 1, although the actual assumptions may sometimes differ from those used for regulatory reporting purposes.
These assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.
Valuation rates of interest and discount rates The valuation interest rate for each contract type is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract adjusted for the risk that asset proceeds are not received by the group.
For some business, this yield is the gross redemption yield or appropriate forward yield on xed interest securities and the running yield on variable interest securities.
For other business, it is the Internal Rate of Return on the portfolio of backing assets.
In 2015, the group continued to hold an additional reserve to protect against the risk of an uplift in defaults in the current economic environment and maintained the level of the long-term default allowance for unapproved securities at 40bps 2014: 40bps.
Default risk on property backing non profit business was provided for by adding 2bps to the long term default allowance in 2014 property default risk was provided for separately, this addition being calculated to maintain the level of the reserve for property default risk.
The group also maintained the 35bps per annum 2014: 35bps for unapproved securities backing non-participating, with-profits business.
For approved securities and swaps backing the non-profit annuity business, the allowance is 9bps per annum 2014: 9bps.
For approved securities and swaps backing non participating with-profits business the allowance is unchanged at 5bps per annum 2014: 5bps.
For unapproved securities backing non-profit annuity business, the credit default allowances equate to 55bps per annum 2014: 54bps when expressed over the duration of the assets held, leading to an overall total default provision of 2.2bn 2014: 2.3bn.
The group believes the total default allowance is prudent to cover all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
For equity investments, the yield is based on the current dividend yield, adjusted for prudence.
For property holdings, yields are based on the rental income payable.
In 2014, this continued to be adjusted for the cost of default, where the default rates used in the calculations vary by tenant category.
From 2015, this is allowed for in the long-term default allowance as discussed above.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and or UK death registrations, with an appropriate allowance for prudence.
These tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.
The majority of internal statistical investigations are carried out at least annually to determine the extent to which the groups experience differs from that of the industry and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.
Persistency The group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually.
Persistency can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.
The group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future expected long-term average persistency levels.
For non-participating contracts where explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Expenses The group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.
Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the groups business plan.
An allowance for expense ination in the future is also made, taking account of both salary and price information.
The expense assumptions also include an appropriate allowance for prudence.
Premiums For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
ii Participating business For its participating business, the group seeks to establish its liabilities at their realistic value following requirements that were previously set out in FRS 27.
Although FRS 27 is no longer an operational standard, the group has grandfathered the provisions into its IFRS reserving methodology.
Non-economic assumptions Non-economic assumptions are set to represent the groups best estimates of future experience.
Economic assumptions The PRAs realistic reporting regime requires a market consistent economic model.
The model is calibrated using market data from a variety of market sources.
This enables assumptions to be determined for the term structure of risk free interest rates, and for property and equity volatility.
Risk free interest rates are determined with reference to the gilt yield curve on the valuation date increased by ten basis points.
Property volatility is set with reference to historic variations in property prices.
Equity volatility is set so that the model reproduces observed market prices of traded equity derivatives.
Correlations between asset classes are based on historic data.
Each investment scenario contains a consistent set of assumptions for investment returns and ination.
Future bonuses Future reversionary and terminal bonuses are consistent with the bonus policies set out in the Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
Guaranteed annuity options The guarantees are valued on a market consistent basis.
The valuation methodology allows for the correlation between interest rates and the proportion of the policyholders who take up the option.
Guaranteed cash options The liability is determined assuming that policyholders choose the most valuable alternative between the annuity and cash available at retirement.
Value of in-force non-participating contracts The group makes a deduction from the liabilities for the expected value of future profits arising on non-participating contracts written in the with-profits fund.
The economic assumptions used to calculate the value of these profits are consistent with those used to calculate liabilities for with-profits business.
Non-economic assumptions represent best estimates of expected future experience on this business.
An explicit allowance is made for non-market risk.

For life assurances, from 2015, an appropriate valuation interest rate is applied at all times during the projection, i. e. when liabilities switch from being negative to positive the valuation interest rate will also switch from being high 4.60% to low 2.60% gross and 2.10% net.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.
A single rate is used if liabilities are negative 4.60% or positive 2.60% gross and 2.10% net throughout.
For 2014, for product groups where liabilities were positive, the lower interest rate 2.25% gross and 1.75% net was used.
However, for product groups where liabilities were negative, the higher rate 6.60% was used.
Consistent approaches are used for pension assurances, with a higher rate of 4.60% 2014: 6.60% applied if liabilities are negative and a lower rate of 2.00% 2014: 1.75% applied if liabilities are positive.
The percentage of the table varies with the duration that the policy has been in-force for the first five years.
The percentage of the table varies with the duration that the policy has been in-force for the first two years.
For term assurance with critical illness, morbidity rates are assumed to deteriorate at a rate of 0.50% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females 2014: 0.50% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females.

Table created by blending PCXA00 with PNXA00 tables.
The base table to be used for bulk purchase annuity policies in deferment is PNMA00 up to and including age 55 and PCMA00 for age 65 and above for males.
The identical method is applied to females using PNFA00 and PCFA00.
For vested annuities, mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to an adjusted version of CMIBs mortality improvement model: CMI 2013 2014: CMI 2013 with the following parameters: Males: Long Term Rate of 2.00% p. a.
2014: 1.50% p. a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 120 For certain annuities, a further allowance is made for the effect of initial selection.
The basis above is applicable up to age 90.
After age 90 the basis is blended towards a bespoke table from age 100 onwards.
The percentage of the TM00 TF00 tables varies with the duration that the policy has been in-force for the first five years.
Thereafter, a bespoke mortality table constructed based on TM00 TF00 tables, AM92 AF92 tables and UK death registrations.
Mortality rates are assumed to reduce whilst business is ceded to reinsurer after which any reduction is maintained but no further reduction is applied based on CMI2013B model with a long-term annual improvement rate of 1.5% for males and 1.0% for females.
There is no change in basis on pre-2015 business.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 153 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Persistency assumptions Lapse rate assumptions are used in the PRA statutory Peak 1 valuation of certain classes of long-term business.
Where this is the case, the valuation persistency basis is set by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
The tables below show the major products where lapse rates have been used.
For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policys lifetime when it is treated as an asset but acts to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policys lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but is applied at a policy by policy level.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash ows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.
A summary of the lapse basis for major classes of non profit business, as dened by the requirements of the annual returns to the PRA, is shown below.

The ultimate cost to the group is greater as a proportion of the catastrophe reinsurance cover is placed with Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, which is exposed to 75% of claims between 35m and 85m, 75% of claims between 85m and 200m and 45% of claims between 200m and 467m.
The impact of a 1 in 500 year modelled windstorm and coastal ood event would exceed the upper limit of the catastrophe cover by approximately 270m 2014: 252m, with an estimated total cost to LGI of 330m 2014: 317m and to the group of 563m 2014: 538m.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 157 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The table shows the impacts on group pre-tax profit and equity, net of reinsurance, under each sensitivity scenario for the group.
The participating funds have been excluded in the above sensitivity analysis as the impact of the sensitivities on IFRS profit and equity is offset by the movement in the unallocated divisible surplus UDS.
The shareholders share of with-profit bonus declared in the year is relatively insensitive to market movements due to the smoothing policies applied.
The interest rate sensitivity assumes a 100bps change in the gross redemption yield on xed interest securities together with a 100bps change in the real yields on variable securities.
For the UK with-profit funds, valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of PRA regulations.
The interest rate sensitivities reect the impact of the regulatory restrictions on the reinvestment rate used to value the liabilities of the long-term business.
Modelling improvements have been made in the year which more accurately isolate the impacts of discrete assumptions changes.
No yield oors have been applied in the estimation of the stresses, despite the current low interest rate environment.
Interest rate and ination expectation have historically shown positive correlation and have therefore been presented next to each other.
The ination stress adopted is a 1% pa increase in ination resulting in a 1% pa reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense ination rate is increased by 1% pa.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields are unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The equity stress is a 10% fall in listed equity market values.
The property stress adopted is a 10% fall in property market value.
Rental income is assumed to be unchanged: however the vacant possession value is stressed down by 10% in line with the market value stress.
Where property is being used to back liabilities, the valuation interest rate used to place a value on the liabilities moves with the implied change in property yields.
The annuitant mortality stress is a 1% reduction in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.
The assurance mortality stress represents an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.
The credit default stress assumes a -10bps stress to the current credit default assumption for unapproved corporate bonds which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities.
The credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of the individual bonds in the asset portfolio and their outstanding term using Moodys global credit default rates.
For the sensitivity to the default of the groups largest external reinsurer, the reinsurer stress shown is equal to the technical provisions ceded to the external reinsurer and represents the impact of the default of largest external reinsurer at an entity level.
The above sensitivity analyses do not reect management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts.
The group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analyses also ignore any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged, though in practice, items of the groups experience may be correlated.
The sensitivity of the profit and equity to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
These results should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order, which could be signicantly more or less than the amounts shown above.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 158 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 21 Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract.
A number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features DPF which entitle the policyholders to receive guaranteed benets as well as additional benets: the amount or timing of which is contractually at the discretion of the group: and which are contractually based on: the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract: realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer: or the profit or loss of the company, fund or other entity which issues the contract.
Contracts with DPF are referred to as participating contracts.
With-profits contracts in the UK and previously most Garantie Long Terme contracts in France were classied as participating.
Long-term insurance Death claims are accounted for on notication of death.
Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made.
Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted.
All other long-term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due.
Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.
The change in the insurance liability reects the reduction in liabilities due to the payment of claims in the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business.
The movement also reects assumption changes relating to variables such as claims expectations, expenses and the unwind of the previous periods expectations.
Under current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance contracts.
UK In the UK, insurance contract liabilities are determined following an annual investigation of the insurance entities in accordance with regulatory requirements.
For non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method.
This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs and contractually guaranteed benets.
For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.
For participating contracts, the liabilities to policyholders are determined on a realistic basis in accordance with guidance previously set out in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 27, Life assurance.
This includes an assessment of the cost of any future options and guarantees granted to policyholders valued on a market consistent basis.
The calculation also takes account of bonus decisions which are consistent with Legal & General Assurance Society Limiteds Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
The shareholders share of the future cost of bonuses is excluded from the assessment of the realistic liability.
In determining the realistic value of liabilities for participating contracts, the value of future profits on non-participating business written in the with-profits part of the fund is accounted for as part of the calculation.
The present value of future profits PVFP for this business is separately determined and its value is deducted from the sum of the liabilities for participating contracts and the unallocated divisible surplus.
Unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are received and non-unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are due.
Overseas All annuity business written by overseas subsidiaries is recognised in line with those written in the UK.
All other long-term insurance contract liabilities for business transacted by overseas subsidiaries are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods which reect local supervisory principles or, in the case of the US, on the basis of US GAAP.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 159 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED General insurance Liabilities, together with related reinsurance recoveries, are established on the basis of current information.
Such liabilities can never be denitive as to their timing or the amount of claims and are therefore subject to subsequent reassessment on a regular basis.
Claims and related reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in respect of all incidents up to the year end.
Provision is made on the basis of available information for the estimated ultimate cost, including claims settlement expenses, claims reported but not yet settled and claims incurred but not yet reported.
An unexpired risk provision is made for any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums and after taking account of investment return.
Liability adequacy tests The group performs liability adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash ows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the group discounts all contractual cash ows and compares this amount with the carrying value of the liability.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and then by establishing a provision for losses.
Reinsurance The groups insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide nancing.
Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benets.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.
Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.
Contracts with reinsurers are assessed to determine whether they contain significant insurance risk.
Contracts that do not give rise to significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered to be financial reinsurance and are accounted for and disclosed in a manner consistent with financial instruments.

Insurance contract undiscounted cash ows are based on the expected date of settlement.
Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predened periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly, unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the table.

In the UK, participating investment contract liabilities are determined in accordance with guidance previously set out in FRS 27, including a value for guarantees, in the same way as participating insurance contracts.
Non-participating investment contracts are unit linked contracts.
Unit linked liabilities are measured at fair value by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the groups unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.
Claims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the year less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.
Future developments IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued in May 2014, is effective, subject to EU endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This standard provides clear guidance over when and how much revenue should be recognised.
It provides a principles-based approach for revenue recognition, and introduces the concept of recognising revenue for obligations as they are satisfied.
An assessment is currently ongoing to determine the impact upon the group, focusing, in particular, on our investment management business.
The standard does not apply to business classied as insurance contracts.
The group does not intend to early adopt this standard.

Borrowings classied as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.
Borrowings comprise core borrowings such as subordinated bond issues and long-term unsecured senior debt.
Operational borrowings include commercial paper issuance and bank borrowings under both committed and uncommitted debt facilities, including bank overdrafts.
Borrowings secured on specic assets cash ows, such as Triple X securitisations and private equity fund linked partnership assets, are included as non recourse borrowings.
Mortgage loans raised by SIPP clients secured on those properties invested in their portfolio of linked SIPP investments which we manage on their behalf are treated as unit linked borrowings.

Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benets to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.

Savings Plan US : and Legal & General Nederland Stichting Pensioenfonds Netherlands, replacing the early retirement scheme previously part of the dened benefit plan.
As from 1 January 2014 the plan was closed for future additions.
The group pays contractual contributions in respect of dened contribution schemes.
The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
Contributions of 51m 2014: 52m were charged as expenses during the year in respect of dened contribution plans.
Dened benefit plans The group operates the following dened benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas: Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund the Fund.
The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995: the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2012.
Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme was, with a few exceptions principally transfers from the Fund, closed to new members from August 2000 and nally closed to new members from April 2007: the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2012.
Legal & General America Inc. Cash Balance Plan US : the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2014.
Legal & General Nederland Stichting Pensioenfonds Netherlands : the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2014.
The UK Fund and Scheme were closed to future accrual on 31 December 2015.
As part of this arrangement, payments to the Fund and Scheme in respect of future accruals will cease from this date and be replaced with a company contribution payment of between 5% and 15%.
In addition, as part of the closure, the company will contribute an additional 3m per annum over the next nine years towards the deficit.
The assets of all UK dened benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds to meet long-term pension obligations to past and present employees.
Trustees are appointed to the schemes and have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the scheme beneciaries.
The trustees long-term objectives are to minimise the risk that there are insufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme over the longer term, control the ongoing operational costs of the schemes and to maximise returns for the beneciaries within an acceptable level of risk.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 172 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 26 Provisions continued ii Retirement benefit obligations continued The total number of members of the UK Fund and Scheme was: 2015 2014 Active 445 537 Deferred 4,013 4,173 Pensioners 3,493 3,371 7,951 8,081 The group works closely with the trustees to develop an investment strategy for each UK scheme in order to meet the long-term objectives of the trustees as noted above.
Each UK scheme has a Statement of Investment Principles which governs the mix of assets and limits for each class of asset.
As noted below the asset mix of the schemes is primarily split between bonds and equities.
Additionally certain of the liabilities of the scheme are secured by way of annuities purchased from the group.
These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes but at 31 December 2015 the value of these annuities, on an IAS 19 basis, was 746m 2014: 723m.
The Scheme and Fund are primarily exposed to equity price risk, interest rate risk, ination risk and longevity risk.
These risks are managed within the risk appetite of the Scheme and Fund and the sensitivity of the net obligations to changes in any of the variables are monitored and action is taken if any risk moves outside of the appetite.
Annuities are purchased to mitigate these risks for certain of the pension liabilities which passes the risks from the Scheme and Fund onto the group.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out on the Scheme and Fund every three years, updated by formal reviews at each reporting date.
The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
Where the Scheme or Fund are in deficit following the triennial valuation, the group and the trustee agree a deficit recovery plan.
Both the Scheme and Fund have formal deficit recovery plans which agree to make good the deficits over a certain period of time.
The triennial valuation at 31 December 2012 showed a total funding deficit for both the Scheme and the Fund of 494m.
As a result of this, a recovery plan was agreed of 55m a year until 2024.
The latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2015 is ongoing and due to be completed shortly.
The Scheme and the Fund liabilities have an average duration of 19.3 years 2014: 23.4 years and 19.4 years 2014: 23.6 years respectively.
The expected undiscounted benets payments to members of the Scheme and Fund, including pensions in payment secured by annuities purchased from the group, are shown in the chart below: UNDISCOUNTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS m 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 2015 2025 2035 2045 2055 2065 2075 2085 Active and Deferred member cashows Pensioner cashows Annuity payments | LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 173 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of dened benefit pension schemes is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the fund is not restricted.
Plan assets exclude any insurance contracts issued by the group.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows.
The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.
Where the unallocated divisible surplus or equity holders funds are affected as a result of actuarial gains and losses on the dened benefit pension scheme, the charge or credit is not recognised in the income statement but through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The benets paid from the dened benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees final pensionable salary for each year of credited service.
The group has no liability for retirement benets other than for pensions.
The Fund and Scheme account for all of the UK and over 97% of worldwide assets of the groups dened benefit schemes.
The principal actuarial assumptions for the UK dened benefit schemes were: Fund and Fund and Scheme Scheme 2015 2014 % % Rate used to discount liabilities 3.80 3.60 1, 2 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.30 2.30 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.60 3.40 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.66 4.30 Rate of general ination RPI 3.00 3.10 Rate of wage ination 2.30 2.30 Post retirement mortality 2015: 100% Fund 85% Scheme of PCMA PCFA 00 with improvement at CMI 2011 base date 2000 with long-term rates 1.5% pa males and 1.0% pa females, with tapering linearly down to nil between ages 90 and 120.

On 1 December 2008, the conditions of the Fund and Scheme were amended to cap future pensionable salary increases at a maximum of 2.5% each year with effect from 1 January 2009: benets accrued before that date have an underpin of the early leaver benets.
On 31 December 2015 the Fund and Scheme were closed to future accrual.
This assumption will not be required after this date.

For relevant non-participating investment contracts, a liability for the present value of this future commission cost is recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract.
The present value of future commission costs is deferred as an asset and amortised over the period during which the related revenue will be recognised.
At each subsequent reporting date, the liability is re-measured to fair value because this financial liability is part of a portfolio of unit linked assets and liabilities whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Any increase in the liability is recognised as an additional deferred cost.
Any change in lapse assumptions or revisions to the underlying assumptions for future cash ows will be reected in the fair value movement for a year.
If the future commission liability decreases, a corresponding adjustment is made to the amortisation of the asset.
The repurchase agreements are presented gross, however they and their related assets are subject to master netting arrangements.
Other financial liabilities include net variation margins on derivative contracts, which are maintained daily.

Capital management policies and objectives The group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage.
The group also seeks to maximise its financial exibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.
Capital measures The group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business.
The measures used by the group include: Accounting bases Management use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and Economic Capital basis to manage capital and cash ow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.
Regulatory bases The financial strength of the groups insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements see below.
One of these regulatory measures, Individual Capital Assessment ICA, measures capital using risk based stochastic techniques, and provides a measure of the level of economic capital required to run the groups business.
In addition, management assess financial strength under the requirements of the Solvency II rules.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 178 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 28 Management of capital resources continued Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements In each country in which the group operates, the local insurance regulator species rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all times throughout the year.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.
The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying xed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities and risk exposures.
The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the group operates are detailed below: UK regulatory basis At the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on PRA rules.
Society was required to hold assets in excess of the higher of two amounts: the first being calculated using the PRA rules specified by the regulator Pillar 1, the second being an economic capital assessment by the company which is reviewed by the PRA Pillar 2, otherwise known as ICA.
The public Pillar 1 capital calculation is calculated by applying xed percentages to liabilities and sums assured at risk or setting aside a proportion of expenses Peak 1.
There are further stress tests for participating business, as measured in the Realistic Balance Sheet Peak 2, which may increase the required capital under Peak 1 calculations.
The private Pillar 2 capital calculation is an assessment of the economic capital required to ensure that the company can meet its liabilities, with a high likelihood, as they fall due.
This is achieved by application of stochastic modelling and scenario testing.
The result is reviewed and may be modied by the PRA.
Regulatory capital for the general insurance business is also calculated using PRA Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 requirements.
The Pillar 1 calculation applies xed percentages to premiums and claims.
Pillar 2 creates a higher capital requirement and is therefore applied in this business.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk prole.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
Dutch regulatory basis The minimum required capital is dened by the fide Nederlandsche Bank N. V. Dutch Supervisory Body.
The basis of the calculation is a percentage of the liabilities plus a percentage of the sum assured at risk and, for some contracts, the premium.
The percentages depend on the guarantees given and the amount of reinsurance cover.
Bermudan regulatory basis Bermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet 120% of the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement BSCR.
The BSCR model follows a standard formula framework: capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying capital factors to the assets and liabilities.
The individual risk elements excluding operational risk are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.
Group regulatory basis In addition to the regulatory capital calculations for the individual rms, the group is required to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD at the balance sheet date.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 179 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Solvency II unaudited From 1 January 2016, the group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a new regulatory basis and to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by PRA in the UK.
In December 2015, the group received approval to calculate its Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model.
The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA.
Capital requirements for a handful of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds.
The groups US insurance businesses are valued on a local statutory basis, following the PRAs approval of the groups application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.
The table below shows the estimated Group Eligible own funds, Solvency Capital Requirement SCR and Surplus own funds based on the Internal Model, Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions TMTP approved by the PRA in December 2015.
The Solvency II results are not audited.

Eligible own funds do not include an accrual for the 2015 final dividend 592m declared in 2016.
29 Acquisition Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method, under which the acquirer recognises the acquirees fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the acquisition date.
Purchased goodwill is recognised as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.
Private equity investment vehicles classied as subsidiaries are those entities over which the group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the operating and financial policies, in order to gain economic benets.
profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
On 1 April 2015, the group acquired 100% of New Life Home Finance Limited, a UK based lifetime mortgage provider for a consideration of 5m.
The acquisition gave rise to an increase in the groups goodwill of 2m and an increase in purchased interest in long-term businesses PILTB and other intangibles of 2m.
This enables the group to offer lifetime mortgages as part of the retirement solutions suite of products.

Current tax Current tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values.
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity.
The tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement has been apportioned between that attributable to policyholders and that attributable to equity holders.
The judgements made in arriving at tax balances in the financial statements are discussed in the notes below.

38 Share-based payments The fair value at the date of grant of the equity instrument is recognised as an expense, spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the group is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
i Description of schemes The group provides a number of equity settled share-based long-term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.
The Savings related share option scheme SAYE allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over either three or five years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the group.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the group shares on the invitation date.
Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Conditional shares can be granted to top managers under the Performance Share Plan PSP, based upon individual and company performance.
Pre the 2014 award, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependent on the groups relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
New performance conditions attached to the 2014 award onwards result in the number of shares being transferred being equally dependent on the groups relative TSR and Earnings per Share EPS Dividend per Share DPS growth.
In addition, the shares vest evenly over three, four and five years.
The company share option scheme CSOP, approved by HMRC, and unapproved Executive share option scheme ESOS are designed to provide a long-term incentive to directors and managers of the group.
The number of options granted is based on the managers grade, salary and performance.
In order for the options to be exercisable, Legal & Generals TSR must exceed the median TSR of the FTSE 100 for a period of at least three years commencing on the date of the grant.
Fair value is calculated using a binomial model, reecting the historic exercise patterns.
| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 191 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED The Share bonus plan SBP awards restricted shares and nil-paid options.
Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reect the eligibility for dividend payments.
Under the Employee share plan ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first 20 of the employees contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between 20 and 150.
From time to time, the group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
The fair value of granted shares is equal to the market value at grant date.
The fair values of the share grants made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions: SAYE SAYE PSP Award date 08-Apr-15 04-Sep-15 14-Apr-15 Weighted average share price 283p 247.2p 282.9p Weighted average exercise price 227p 221p n a Expected volatility 26% 26% 19% Expected life 35 years 35 years 35 years Risk free investment rate 0.69%1.1% 0.82%1.24% 0.56% Dividend yield 4.1% 4.1% 4.0% ii Total recognised expense The total recognised expense relating to share-based payments in 2015 was 26m 2014: 28m before tax, all of which related to equity settled share schemes.

| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 193 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED 39 Share capital, share premium and employee scheme treasury shares An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the group exchanging a xed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a xed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any group entity purchases the companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the balance sheet.

Shares owned by these vehicles are included at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity.
They are disclosed as employee scheme treasury shares until they vest to employees.
Share-based liabilities to employees may also be settled via purchases directly from the market or by the issue of new shares.

43 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is inuenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.
Various group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigations or issues.
Legal & General Portfolio Management Services Limited PMS is currently cooperating with an investigation by FCA into Structured Deposits products issued by PMS between 2006 and 2014.
PMS has responded to FCAs requests for information and awaits FCAs feedback.
This matter is at an early stage, management and legal advisers will evaluate on an ongoing basis whether any provision should be recognised.
In 1975, Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Ofce on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether the Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
The Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions or corporate disposals.
Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of group companies in support of their business activities, including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain group companies liabilities under the group pension fund and scheme.
Society has provided indemnities, a liquidity and expense risk agreement, a deed of support and a cash and securities facility in respect of the liabilities of group companies to facilitate the groups matching adjustment reorganisation pursuant to Solvency II.

Future developments In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
IFRS 16 now requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for virtually all lease contracts, bringing commitments in relation to operating leases as currently dened in IAS 17, Leases onto the balance sheet.
The impact of the standard on lessor accounting is signicantly smaller with the provisions remaining closely aligned to those in IAS 17 although the IASB have issued updated guidance on the denition of a lease.
An assessment of the impacts of the standard on the groups financial statements will be carried out in 2016.
