26 Financial instruments and financial risk management a Categories of financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, grouped according to the categories defined in IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement, are asfollows: 2015 2014 $m $m Financial assets Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships 0.2 0.2 Available-for-sale investments 2.7 15.6 Loans and receivables at amortised cost including cash and cash equivalents 1,703.9 1,895.2 Fair value through profit and loss liquid investments and mark-to-market debtors 925.4 1,529.1 Financial liabilities Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships 3.5 11.0 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 3,235.5 3,104.1 Fair value through profit and loss mark-to-market payables 22.9 70.6 629.7 254.4 Antofagasta plc 161 Notes to the financial statements 26 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued b Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices: the fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions: and the fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis based on the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
The fair value of each category of financial asset and liability is not materially different from the carrying values presented for either 2015 or 2014.
Financial assets and liabilities measurement as fair value through profit and loss are designated as such upon initial recognition.
The following table provides an analysis of the financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, groupedinto levels 1to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based onobservable market data unobservable inputs.

c Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in general to reduce exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Groups risk management framework.
The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board withits review of the effectiveness of the risk management process, andmonitoring of key risks and mitigations.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.
i Commodity price risk The Group generally sells its copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes output at prevailing market prices, subject to final pricing adjustments which may range from one to five months after delivery to the customer, and it is therefore exposed to changes in market prices for copper and molybdenum both in respect of future sales and previous sales which remain open as to final pricing.
In 2015, sales of copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes represented 90.7% of Group turnover and therefore revenues and earnings depend significantly on LME and realised copper prices.
The Group uses futures, min-max instruments and options to manage its exposure to copper prices.
These instruments may give rise to accounting volatility due to fluctuations in their fair value prior to the maturity of the instruments.
Details of those copper and molybdenum concentrate sales and copper cathode sales which remain open as to final pricing are given in Note 5.
Details of commodity rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 26 d. 162 Antofagasta plc Annual report and financial statements 2015 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE F FIIN NA AN NC CIIA AL L S ST TA AT TE EM MENTS ENTS OTHER INFORMATION Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the copper price on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date.
Amovement in the copper forward price as at the reporting date will affect the final pricing adjustment to sales which remain open at that date, impacting the trade receivables balance and consequently the income statement.
A movement in the copper forward price will also affect the valuation of commodity derivatives, impacting the hedging reserve in equity if the fair value movement relates to an effective designated cash flow hedge, and impacting the income statement if it does not.
The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as currency rates, remain constant.
If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had increased by 10 cents, net earnings would have increased by $18.5 million 2014 increase by $16.5 million and hedging reserves in equity would have decreased less than $0.4 million 2014 decrease less than$0.1 million.
If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had decreased by 10 cents, net earnings would have decreased by $17.2 million 2014 decrease by $16.5 million and hedging reserves in equity would have increased less than $0.4 million 2014 increase less than $0.1 million.
In addition, a movement in the average copper price during the year would impact revenue and earnings.
A 10 cents change in the average copper price during the year would have affected net earnings by $62.5 million 2014 $64.7 million and earnings per share by 6.3 cents 2014 6.6 cents, based on production volumes in 2015, without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing and hedging activity.
A$1 change in the average molybdenum price for the year would have affected net earnings by $9.4 million 2014 $7.0 million, and earnings per share by 1.0 cents 2014 0.7 cents, based on production volumes in 2015, and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing.
A $100 change in the average gold price for the year would have affected net earnings by $10.4 million 2014 $9.7 million, and earnings per share by 1.1 cents 2014 1.0 cents, based on production volumes in 2015, and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing.
ii Currency risk The Group is exposed to a variety of currencies.
The US dollar, however, isthe currency in which the majority of the Groups sales are denominated.
Operating costs are influenced by the countries in which the Groups operations are based principally in Chile as well as those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined.
After the US dollar, the Chilean peso is the most important currency influencing costs and to a lesser extent sales.
Given the significance of the US dollar to the Groups operations, this is the presentational currency of the Group for internal and external reporting.
TheUS dollar is also the currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of this may be held in other currencies, notably Chilean pesos and sterling, to meet short-term operational and capital commitments and dividend payments.
When considered appropriate, the Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The Group may also use these instruments to reduce currency exposure on future transactions and cash flows.
Details of any exchange rate derivatives entered by the Group in the year are given in Note 26. d. The currency exposure of the Groups cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments is given in Note 23, and the currency exposure of the Groups borrowings is given in Note 26. b.
The effects of exchange gains and losses included in the income statement are given in Note 5.
Exchange differences on translation of the net assets of entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar the most material of which is Aguas fide Antofagasta S. A. are taken to the currency translation reserve and are disclosed in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 123.
Currency sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the US dollar Chilean peso exchange rate on the financial instruments held as at thereporting date.
The impact on profit or loss is as a result of the retranslation of monetary financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments, trade receivables, trade payables and borrowings.
The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are effective designated cash flow hedges, and changes in the fair value of available-for-sale equity investments.
The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as interest rates, remain constant.
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, net earnings would have decreased by $2.9 million 2014 decrease by $6.2 million : and hedging reserves in equity would have decreased by nil 2014 decrease by $6.1 million.
If the US dollar had weakened by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, net earnings would have increased by $1.7 million 2014 increased by $15.2 million : and hedging reserves in equity would have increased by nil 2014 increase by $ 0.7 million.
iii Interest rate risk The Groups policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates.
Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the Groups net finance income orcost, and to a lesser extent on the value of financial assets and liabilities.
TheGroup occasionally uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage interest rate exposures on a portion of its existing borrowings.
Details of any interest rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 26 d i.
Interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings is given in Note 24.
Antofagasta plc 163 Notes to the financial statements 26 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in interest rates in relation to the financial instruments held as at the reporting date.
The impact on profit or loss reflects the impact on annual interest expense in respect of the floating rate borrowings held as at the reporting date, and the impact on annual interest income in respect of cash and cash equivalents held as at the reporting date.
The impact onequity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are effective designated cash flow hedges.
If the interest rate increased by 1%, based on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date, net earnings would have increased by $4.4 million 2014 increase by $2.5 million and hedging reserves in equity would have increased by $0.7 million 2014 increase by $0.3 million.
This does not include the effect on the income statement of changes in thefair value of the Groups liquid investments relating tothe underlying investments in fixed income instruments.
iv Other price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on its available-for-sale equity investments.
Equity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the equity values of the available-for-sale financial assets held as at the reporting date.
If the value of the available-for-sale investments had increased by 10% as at the reporting date, equity would have increased by $0.3 million 2014 increase by $1.6 million.
There would have been no impact on the income statement.
v Cash flow risk The Groups future cash flows depend on a number of factors, including commodity prices, production and sales levels, operating costs, capital expenditure levels and financial income and costs.
Its cash flows are therefore subject to the exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks described above as well as operational factors and input costs.
To reduce the risk of potential short-term disruptions to the supply of key inputs such as electricity and sulphuric acid, the Group enters into mediumand long-term supply contracts to help ensure continuity ofsupply.
Long-term electricity supply contracts are in place at each of the Groups mines, in most cases linking the cost of electricity under the contract to the current cost of electricity on the Chilean grids.
The Group seeks to lock in supply of sulphuric acid for future periods of a year or longer, with contract prices agreed in the latter part of the year, to be applied to purchases of acid in the following year.
Further information on production and sales levels and operating costs aregiven in the Operational review on page 39. vi Credit risk Credit risk arises from trade and other receivables, cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily to trade receivables.
The credit risk on cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments and on derivative financial instruments is limited as the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
All customers are subject to credit review procedures, including the use ofexternal credit ratings where available.
Credit is provided only within setlimits, which are regularly reviewed.
The main customers are recurrent with a good credit history during the years while they have been customers.
Outstanding receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
The amounts presented inthe balance sheet are net of allowances for any doubtful receivables.
As detailed in Note 17, the Group has provided a total of $229.7 million of loan financing to its associated company Alto Maipo SpA Alto Maipo.
This loan financing forms part of the Groups total funding of the Alto Maipo project, along with the capital contributions the Group has made to Alto Maipo, and the recovery of this balance will derive from the cash flows generated by the project once construction has completed and the project is operational.
vii Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and financing facilities, through the review of forecast and actual cash flows.
The Group typically holds surplus cash in demand or term deposits or highly liquid investments, which typically can be accessed or liquidated within 24hours.
The majority of borrowings comprise corporate loans at Los Pelambres, repayable over periods of up to three years, corporate loans at Centinela Concentrates, repayable over approximately seven years and Antucoya long-term subordinated debt repayable over approximately 12 years.
At the end of 2015, the Group was in a net debt position 2014 net debt position, asdisclosed in Note 33. c. Details of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments are given in Note 23, while details of borrowings including thematurity profile are given in Note 24. d.

viii Capital risk management The Groups objectives are to return capital to shareholders while leaving the Group with sufficient funds to progress its short-, mediumand long-term growth plans as well as preserving the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of net cash defined as cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments less borrowings which was a net debt by $1,023.5 million at 31 December 2015 2014 net debt $1.6 million, as well as gross cash defined as cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments which was $1,731.6 million at 31December 2015 2014 $2,374.5 million.
The Groups total cash is held in a combination of on demand and term deposits and managed funds investing inhigh-quality, fixed income instruments.
Some of the managed funds have been instructed to invest in instruments with average maturities greater than 90days.
These amounts are presented as liquid investments but are included in net cash for monitoring and decision-making purposes.
The Group has ariskaverse investment strategy.
The Groups borrowings are detailed in Note 24.
Additional project finance or shareholder loans are taken out by the operating subsidiaries tofund projects on a case-by-case basis.
d Derivative financial instruments The Group occasionally uses derivative financial instruments, in general to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows have been recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement have been recorded within revenue.
Thetime value element of changes in the fair value of derivative options is excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in the income statement within other finance items.
Realised gains and losses and changes in the fair value of exchange and interest derivatives are recognised within other finance items for those derivatives where hedge accounting has not been applied.
When hedge accounting has been applied the realised gains and losses onexchange and interest derivatives are recognised within other finance items and interest expense respectively.
