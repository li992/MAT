Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
In February 2015 and 2014 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for generally five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
Giventhe current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts of goodwill.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 9% to 12% 2014: 7% to 11%.
On a post-tax basis, the discount rates range from 7% to 10% 2014: 6% to 8%.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each cash-generating unit.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of 2% to 3% 2014: 2% to 3%.
The challenging economic climate and significant shifts in the retail industry structure has resulted in revised forecast cash flows and updated discount rates.
A resulting impairment charge has been recognised of 116m 2014: nil related to Dobbies 83m and other UK businesses 33m.
Dobbies and the other UK businesses are within the UK segment.
This charge has been recognised in the cost of sales line in the Group Income Statement.
A final regulation has been published by the European Commission, imposing a cap on interchange fees on credit and debit cards.
This change to existing interchange fees, which is expected to come into force during the first half of 2015, along with the forecast impact of mitigating management actions, has been considered as part of goodwill impairment testing for the Tesco Bank cash-generating unit.
No reduction in the asset recognised has been required following completion of this review.
