Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information The consolidated financial statements of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC the Company and its subsidiaries collectively, the Group for the period ended 30 September 2015 were authorised for issue by the Directors on 1 December 2015.
The Company was incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Company is registered in England and Wales.
The address of the registered office is 12 Smithfield Street, London EC1A 9BD.
The separate financial statements of the Company are also reported.
The financial statements represent the period from 29 September 2014 to 30 September 2015.
The comparatives are for the 52 week period ended 28 September 2014.
The significant accounting policies are disclosed below.
The policies for the Group and the Company are consistent unless otherwise stated.
Restatement During the period, the Group adopted IFRIC 21 Levies.
Specific transitional provisions are applicable to first-time application of IFRIC 21.
The Group has applied the relevant transitional provisions and restated the comparative amounts on a retrospective basis, see note 2 a below.
In addition, the Group has changed its accounting policy relating to client settlement cash, consequently the Group has applied IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and restated the comparative amounts on a retrospective basis, see note 2 b below.
A pplication of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and changes in accounting policy a.
New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted.
The effect of the adoption of these changes on the consolidated financial statements is described below.
IFRIC 21 Levies IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and has been applied retrospectively.
It is applicable to all levies imposed by financial services regulators under legislation, other than outflows that are within the scope of other standards and fines or other penalties for breaches of legislation.
The interpretation clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment as identified by the relevant legislation occurs.
The trigger that gives rise to the liability to pay the FSCS Levy is that Brewin Dolphin Limited is a company authorised by the FCA at the levy date of 1 July.
At this point, the full FSCS Levy is recognised.
The impact of this new interpretation in the current period is to reduce other operating costs by 4,000 and increase profit for the period by 3,000.
The impact on prior periods is outlined in note 37.
In addition to adopting the above new interpretation, the following amendments came into effect in the current period: Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting Amendments to IAS 39 Annual Improvements 20102012 Cycle Annual Improvements 20112013 Cycle The application of the above amendments had no material effect on the accounts of the Company or Group for the periods presented.
98 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 b.
Changes in accounting policy The Group has amended its accounting policy for client settlement cash.
Client settlement account balances were previously shown as client settlement cash included within cash and cash equivalents.
The accounting policy has been changed to reclassify these balances to either trade and other payables or trade and other receivables, which better reflects the substance of these balances.
The impact of this change in the current period is to reduce cash and cash equivalents by 19.7 million, decrease trade and other payables by 16.6 million, and increase trade and other receivables by 3.1 million.
There is no impact on profit for the period.
The impact on prior periods is outlined in note 37, firms cash was not impacted by the change.
c. New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective Effective for period beginning on or after 1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 1 IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Amendments to Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exemption 1 January 2016 1 IFRS 11 Amendments to Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016 1 IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016 1 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017 1 IAS 1 Amendments to Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2016 Amendments to Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and 1 IAS 16 and IAS 38 Amortisation 1 January 2016 1 IAS 27 Amendments to Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016 1 Annual Improvements to IFRS 2012 2014 Cycle 1 January 2016 1 These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The Directors are currently reviewing the impact of these new standards, amendments and interpretations but do not intend to adopt the standards early.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements for both the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union, Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and Companies Act 2006. b.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest thousand pound 000 except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
c. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC has taken advantage of the legal dispensation not to present its own Statement of Comprehensive Income or Income Statement.
The amount of the profit for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in the Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
d. Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Strategic Report.
99 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Overview Information Statements Report Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
Significant accounting policies continued e. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
f. Transaction date accounting All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
The underlying investments are not shown in the financial statements of the Group.
g. Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
h. Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents commissions, investment management fees, renewal commissions and other income, excluding VAT, receivable in respect of the period.
Investment management fees and renewal commissions are recognised in the period in which the related service is provided and commissions are recognised when the transaction is performed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Income Statement to the extent that they represent a realised profit and loss for the Company.
Other operating income Interest receivable and payable on client free money balances is netted to calculate the Groups share of interest receivable and included under the heading Other operating income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
k. Leases Rentals on operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
100 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 l. Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equitysettled share-based transactions are set out in note 31.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
m. Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
n. Investments in subsidiaries In the Companys accounts investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
o. Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not reversed in a subsequent period see note 3 v for the Impairment accounting policy.
When the consideration transferred by the Group is deferred or contingent, this is valued at its acquisition date fair value, and is included in the consideration transferred in a business combination.
Changes in the deferred or contingent consideration, which occur in the measurement period, are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
Subsequently to the measurement period the deferred and contingent considerations are revised annually at the balance sheet date and any corresponding adjustments are posted to the Income Statement.
Such deferred or contingent consideration may be settled in shares see note 3 t for the Shares to be issued accounting policy.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
101 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Overview Information Statements Report Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
Significant accounting policies continued ii Client relationships Intangible assets classified as client relationships are recognised when acquired as part of a business combination or when separate payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of Investment Managers.
Client relationships acquired separately are initially recognised at cost.
If acquired as part of a business combination the initial cost of client relationships is the fair value at the acquisition date.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
When separate payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of Investment Managers, elements of the total consideration may be deferred or contingent.
In such cases the cost of the recognised client relationships includes the Companys best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date.
Client relationships are amortised over seven to fifteen years, their minimum estimated useful lives.
iii Computer software Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset.
Costs of acquiring computer software are treated as an intangible asset and amortised over three to ten years, dependent upon the assessment of the expected useful life of the software, on a straight line basis from the date the software is operating as management intended.
Computer software developed internally is separately identified and recognised as an intangible asset if it is part of a specifically authorised project which will give probable future economic benefits over a period and is amortised over three to ten years on a straight line basis from the date the software comes into use, dependent on the assessment of the expected useful life of the software.
The assessment of the expected useful life of computer software is based on the contractual terms or where appropriate past experience of the life of similar assets.
p. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
Depreciation has been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 4 years Office equipment 4 to 10 years Leasehold improvements to the earlier of the first break clause of the lease or 10 years Motor vehicles 5 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments and non-financial assets, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Fair value for measurement and or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date: Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset of liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
102 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 r. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
i Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL : available-for-sale financial assets: and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified as FVTPL where the financial asset is held-for-trading or it is designated as FVTPL.
A financial asset is classified as held-for-trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future.
Financial assets classified as FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividends or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the Income Statement.
The fair value is determined in the manner described in note 3 q. Available-for-sale financial assets AFS Certain shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 3 q.
Gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit and loss when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of the impairment.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
In subsequent periods if the amount of impaired loss decreases, in respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
103 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Overview Information Statements Report Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
Significant accounting policies continued ii Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the other gains and losses line item in the Income Statement.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
s. Netting of balances Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net where there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and an operational intention to settle net.
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle against delivery of stock are shown gross.
t. Shares to be issued including premium Shares to be issued represent the Companys best estimate of the amount of ordinary shares in the Company, which are likely to be issued following business combinations or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Companys shares.
The sum payable which will be converted into shares of equivalent value is discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and is revised annually in the light of actual results.
The resulting interest charge from the unwind of the discount is included within finance costs.
Where shares are due to be issued within a year the sum is included in current liabilities.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets excluding interest are recognised immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurement recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is not recycled.
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
104 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 v. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of impairment testing, client relationships and goodwill are allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Fair value is established by valuing clients funds under management in each of the cash-generating units at the period end: the percentages of funds being used depending on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and discretionary funds.
If the carrying amount relating to any cash-generating unit exceeds the calculated fair value less costs to sell, a value in use is calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, thecarrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
w. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows where the effect of the time value of money is material.
Where some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount receivable can be measured reliably.
Onerous contracts Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.
Components of the Group are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable and the component is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Components of the Group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
No depreciation is charged on businesses classified as held for sale.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies i.
Recognition of disposal of Stocktrade In May 2015, the Group signed an agreement to sell its Execution Only division, Stocktrade, to Alliance Trust Savings Limited the Purchaser for 14 million.
As at 30 September 2015, the consideration has not been recognised in the financial statements, since the Group continues to maintain control over the discontinued operation and is exposed to variable returns in the form of income and associated expenses, even though some clients contracts have transferred to the Purchaser and are being administered on its systems.
The decision not to recognise the consideration is a material critical accounting judgement.
Associated costs of disposal, including onerous contracts and the resultant provisions have been recognised in accordance with IAS37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Refer to note 13 for additional information.
Goodwill and client relationships The Group assesses whether payments made to newly recruited investment teams under contractual agreements represent payments for the acquisition of client relationships or remuneration for ongoing services provided to the Group.
The assessment requires judgement concerning the terms and levels of these payments to determine whether the costs are capitalised or expensed.
Payments made for the acquisition of client relationships are capitalised whereas those that are judged to be in relation to the provision of ongoing services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
During the period the Group expensed 259,000 in relation to the acquisition of client relationships and there has been a net reduction to the client relationship intangible assets of 105,000 relating to the reassessment of deferred purchase consideration liabilities for past acquisitions.
In the prior period, the Group capitalised 7,468,000 and expensed 217,000. b.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty i.
Goodwill and client relationships Amortisation of client relationships The useful economic life over which client relationships are amortised is determined by the expected duration of the client relationships which are determined with reference to past experience of account closures, in particular the average life of those relationships, and future expectations.
During the period, client relationships were amortised over a 7 to 15 year period.
The amortisation for the period was 9,219,000 2014: 13,592,000, a reduction in the average amortisation period by one year would increase the amortisation expense for the period by 834,000 2014: 1,094,000.
Impairment of goodwill and client relationships Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group values the recoverable amount of goodwill and client relationships at the fair value less costs of disposal.
The calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal is based on the valuation of the funds under management, which make up the relevant intangible asset.
A percentage is applied to funds under management 3% for discretionary funds and 1% for advisory funds to determine the fair value.
These percentages have been based on recent public transactions.
The recoverable amount is sensitive to movements in the valuation of funds under management.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 17.
106 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 ii.
Retirement benefit obligation The calculation of the present value of the retirement benefit obligation is determined by using actuarial valuations.
Management make key assumptions in determining the inputs into the actuarial valuations, which may differ from actual developments in the future.
These assumptions are governed by IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised 2011, and include the determination of the discount rate, lifeexpectancies and future salary increases.
Due to the complexities in the valuation, the retirement benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
The detailed assumptions are set out in note 27. iii.
Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP During the period, the Group granted its second additional award under the LTIP.
The scheme includes performance based vesting conditions, which impacts the amount of benefit paid.
The Group has made assumptions on the likelihood of meeting the performance conditions in determining the expense in the period.
The LTIP charge for the period was 669,000: an absolute increase of 10% in the vesting assumptions would increase the charge for the period by 251,000.
Further information on the scheme is disclosed in note 31. iv.
Provisions Sundry claims and associated costs The Group recognises a provision for sundry claims and associated costs.
The valuation of the claims is based on the best estimate discounted to present value where the impact of the time value of money is material.
Further information is disclosed in note 34.
It isnot possible to perform a sensitivity analysis on this balance as it is impracticable.
Leasehold dilapidations The Group recognises a provision for leasehold dilapidations.
The valuation of the leasehold dilapidations is based on the best estimate of the likely cash flows discounted to present value.
The estimation also includes assumptions about the split of the total estimation of the cost between dilapidations relating to general wear and tear, specific requirements to replace items, and the removal of leasehold improvements.
If the estimate of the likely cash flows used in the calculation of this provision was increased by 10%, theprovision would increase by 164,000.
The leasehold dilapidation provision has increased during the period by 1,200,000.
The increase consists of additions of 1,680,000, less utilisations of 232,000 and unused amounts reversed of 248,000.
The increase in the provision is primarily attributable to the refinement of the estimation methodology as a result of now being able to make a more reliable estimate.
Onerous leases The Group has recognised a provision for onerous leases of 4,069,000 2014: 5,779,000.
The valuation of an onerous lease is based on the best estimate of the likely future costs discounted to present value.
Where the provision is in relation to premises and it is more likely than not that the premises will be sublet, an allowance for sublease income has been included in the valuation.
If the assumptions regarding the sublet income are removed, the provision would increase by 1,232,000 to 5,301,000.

Impairment Impairment of purchased software During the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2014, the Board announced that it had taken the decision to terminate the rollout of a major new stockbroking and wealth management software into the Discretionary Wealth Management business of the Group and only to use it within Stocktrade, the Groups Execution Only division.
The decision to terminate the rollout of the new software into the Group was an indication of impairment.
As a result, the recoverable amount in use was compared to the carrying value of the software which resulted in an impairment charge of 31.7 million.

For client relationships, impairment testing is performed at each reporting date.
The recoverable amount for each of the CGUs is the fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is determined by applying percentages to the funds under management for each CGU.
The percentages applied are based on reference to recent observable market transactions.
Discretionary funds are valued at 3% and advisory funds are valued at 1% of assets under management.
Sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions A 10bp absolute change in the value of funds under management used for the purpose of impairment testing impacts the valuation of the CGUs collectively by - 3.9% or - 23.3 million movement on the estimated value of funds under management of 593.2 million of the CGUs which have goodwill balances as at 30 September 2015.

Shares to be issued including premium and other deferred purchase liabilities The Group acquires investment businesses and teams of Investment Managers, bringing with them funds under management the latter classified as the intangible asset client relationships on deferred purchase terms based on the value of income introduced over, normally, a three year period.
The payment is normally made in ordinary shares and these shares typically have to be held for a further three years.
At the discretion of the Board these shares can be purchased in the market rather than issued.
The estimated likely cost of these shares is reassessed annually, see notes 3 t and 4.
During the period there was a net downward assessment, see note 4 a of 0.1 million 2014: 7.5 million net upward assessment.
The other side of the liability is recorded in intangible assets-client relationships, see note 16.
In the event of the Group being acquired by a third party, provisions exist to renegotiate the deferred purchase consideration into the shares of the acquiring entity, or for the deferred settlement period to be truncated.

Financial instruments and risk management Overview This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the financial instrument key risks market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, the Groups policy and procedures for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Risk management The Board of Directors have overall responsibility for establishing and overseeing the Groups Risk Management Framework and risk appetite.
The Board have established a clear relationship between the Groups strategic objectives and the level of capital which the Board are prepared to place at risk through a Risk Appetite Statement.
The Risk Appetite Statement outlines the nature and quantum of risk that the Board wishes the Group to bear its risk appetite in order to achieve its strategic objectives whilst remaining within all regulatory constraints and its own defined levels of capital and liquidity.
The Board reviews the statement and related qualitative and quantitative measures on at least an annual basis to ensure the document continues to reflect the Boards appetite for risk within the context of the environment the Group operates within.
The Groups Board Risk Committee provides oversight of the adequacy of the Groups Risk Management Framework based on the risks to which the Group is exposed.
They monitor how management comply with the Groups risk management policies and procedures.
They are assisted in the discharge of this duty by the Groups Risk & Compliance Department which has responsibility for monitoring the overall risk environment of the Group.
The Board Risk Committee also regularly monitors exposure against the Groups Risk Appetite.
The Groups Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial statements and working closely with the Board Risk Committee, for both review and oversight of internal controls.
The Audit Committee is assisted in the discharge of its obligations by Internal Audit who undertake periodic and ad-hoc reviews on the effectiveness of controls and compliance with risk management policies.
126 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The Groups risk management policies are intended to ensure that risks are identified, evaluated and subject to ongoing monitoring and mitigation where appropriate.
The risk policies also serve to set the appropriate control framework, the adequacy and effectiveness of which is also subject to ongoing testing and review.
The aim is to promote a robust risk culture with employees across the Group understanding their role and obligations under the framework.
Capital structure and capital management The capital structure of the Group and Company consists of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
Capital generated from the business is both reinvested in the business to generate future growth and returned to shareholders, principally in the form of dividends.
Consideration is given to regulatory capital requirements and to ensure the Group is sufficiently robust to withstand periods of market stress.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the period.
Regulatory capital requirements The Group conducts an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA to assess the appropriate amount of regulatory capital to be held by the Group.
There are two regulated entities in the Group: Brewin Dolphin Limited BDL regulated by the FCA and Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
The Jersey branch of BDL is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
The Pillar II capital assessment of the ICAAP is the Board of Directors opinion of the level of capital the Group should hold against the risks to which the Group is exposed.
This takes into the account the Groups Principal Risk Register which is updated on a regular basis.
The ICAAP is kept updated throughout the year to take account of changes to the Groups Principal Risks and for any material changes to strategy or business plans.
The ICAAP is discussed and approved at a Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Board meeting at least annually.
Regulatory capital adequacy is monitored by management.
The Group uses the standardised approach to Credit Risk to calculate Pillar I requirements.
The Group complied with the FCAs regulatory capital requirements throughout the period.
The regulatory capital resources of the Group were as follows: 1 2015 2014 000 000 Called up share capital 2,793 2,745 Share premium account 142,135 139,420 Own shares 28,153 16,045 Revaluation reserve 7,652 Merger reserve 70,553 61,380 Profit and loss account 31,823 16,822 219,151 211,974 Shares to be issued 9,304 19,280 Regulatory capital resources before deductions 228,455 231,254 Deduction Intangible assets net of deferred tax liability 83,076 90,019 Deduction Free deliveries 88 172 Total regulatory capital resources after deductions 145,291 141,063 1 The comparative balances have not been restated for the impact of the adjustments in notes 2 and 37, as these adjustments do not impact previously reported regulatory capital resources.
Information disclosure under Pillar 3 of the Capital Requirements Directive will be published on the Groups website before 31 December 2015 at www.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each financial asset and financial liability, are disclosed in note 3 r to the financial statements.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups market risk management is to both control and manage exposure within the Groups risk appetite whilst accepting the inherent risk of market fluctuations.
The Group undertakes investment management and stockbroking activities on an agency basis on behalf of its clients.
The Group holds financial instruments as principal, but does not trade as principal.
All trades are matched in the market see note 20.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
The total net foreign exchange exposure resulting from income yet to be converted to sterling at the year end was a debtor of 495,000 2014: 122,000.
At the period end Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited TBD had net assets of 3.6 million 2014: 4.7 million denominated in its local currency Euros.
The Group is exposed to translation risk in respect of the foreign currency value of the net assets of TBD.
The Group does not hold any derivatives 2014: none.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during the period.
128 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Equity price risk The Group is exposed to equity risk arising from its available-for-sale investments and those held-for-trading.
Equity investments designated as non-current available-for-sale investments are held for strategic purposes rather than trading purposes and the Group does not actively trade in these investments.
Equity price sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
If equity prices had been 5% higher lower: Pre-tax profit for the period ended 30 September 2015 would have been 47,000 higher lower 2014: 45,600 higher lower due to changes in the value of held-for-trading investment: and Other equity reserves as at 30 September 2015 would increase decrease by 2,300 2014: increase decrease by 500,000 pre-tax for the Group as a result of the changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments.
The Groups sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior period.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the Groups cash and in respect of client deposits.
The Group holds client deposits on demand variable interest rate.
At the end of the period a 1% increase in base rate would have increased pre-tax profitability by 939,000 2014: 784,000. Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a client or other counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arises principally from the settlement of client and market transactions settlement risk and cash deposited at banks.
Settlement risk Exposures to settlement risk are spread across a large number of counterparties and clients.
A delivery versus payment DVP settlement method is also used for the majority of transactions, ensuring that securities and cash are exchanged within a short period of time.
Consequently, no residual maturity analysis is presented.
The Group also holds collateral in the form of cash, as well as equity and bonds which are quoted on recognised exchanges.
This collateral is held, principally, in Group nominee accounts.
Concentration of credit risk The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with the exception of cash where the majority is spread across four major banks.
Maximum exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is equal to the balance sheet figure.
Credit exposure Credit exposure in relation to settlement risk is monitored daily.
The Groups exposure to large trades is limited with an average bargain size in the current period of 11,060 2014: 11,700 : there are additional controls for high value trades.
Impaired assets The total gross amount of individually impaired assets in relation to trade receivables at the period end was 351,000 2014: 437,000.
Collateral valued at fair value by the Group in relation to these impaired assets was 243,000 2014: 240,000.
This collateral is stock held in the clients account which per our client terms and conditions can be sold to meet any unpaid liabilities falling due.
The net difference has been provided as a doubtful debt see note 21.
Note 21 also details amounts past due but not impaired.
Non-impaired assets Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired in respect of trade receivables relate mainly to bonds and equity trades quoted on a recognised exchange, are matched in the market, and are either traded on a DVP basis or against a clients portfolio in respect of which any one trade would normally be a small percentage of the clients collateral held in the Group nominee.
At the period end no financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired had been renegotiated 2014: none.
Loans to employees are repayable over 5 to 10 years see note 21.
129 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Overview Information Statements Report Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 26.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The credit risk on liquid funds, cash and cash equivalents, is limited as deposits are diversified across a panel of major banks.
This ensures that the Group is not excessively exposed to an individual counterparty.
The Groups policy requires cash deposits to be placed with banks with a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2 S&P P-2 Moodys F-2 Fitch, excluding Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited.
Requirements and limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
The Groups allocation of cash and cash equivalents to S&P rating grades has been outlined in the below table: A-1 A-1 A-2 Below A-2 Cash and cash equivalents 0.2% 67.2% 30.8% 1.8% Held by Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited.
The Group maintains a set of Credit Risk policies which are regularly reviewed by the Board.
A due diligence review is also performed on all counterparties on an annual basis, at a minimum.
The investment of cash is managed by the Treasury Department.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to credit risk during the period.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains adequate cash resources to meet its financial obligations at all times.
All client cash deposits are repayable on demand.
At 30 September 2015, the Group had access to an unsecured overdraft facility of 12 million 2014: 15 million.
The Group has a Liquidity Policy which is reviewed by the Board regularly.
As the Group normally deals with the market on a DVP basis, liquidity risk is monitored by daily exception reports of unmatched items past settlement date and managed by the Credit Control Department.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to liquidity risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during the period.
The following are the undiscounted cash flows, with the exception of shares to be issued, of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

132 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 27.
Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates a registered Defined Contribution Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Senior Staff Pension Fund and a registered Defined Benefit Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Limited RBS in the UK which both offer pensions in retirement and death benefits to members.
The disclosures provided are in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme only the Scheme.
Pension benefits are related to the members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The pension is payable for life and has elements increasing in payment in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% p. a.
Since 1 April 2003 the Scheme has been closed to new members.
Members under age 55 at 1 April 2004 ceased to accrue further service in the Scheme from that date.
Contributions to the Scheme for the year beginning October 2015 are expected to be 3.0 million.
The Scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the Scheme is subject to the Scheme funding requirements outlined in Section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
The Scheme was established under trust and is governed by the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the Scheme has appointed Trustees.
Although the Group bears the financial cost of the Scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustees, who have a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.
Valuation for funding purposes The valuation as at 31 December 2011 and provisional valuation as at 31 December 2014: Provisional valuation 31 December 31 December 2011 2014 000 000 Value of scheme assets 58,468 81,638 Actuarial value of scheme liabilities in respect of In-service members 25,135 17,598 Deferred pensioners 23,689 31,459 Current pensioners and dependants 29,836 43,926 78,660 92,983 Scheme deficit 20,192 11,345 Funding level 74% 88% The last formal scheme funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 31 December 2011.
As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the formal scheme funding valuation as at 31 December 2014 has not yet been finalised and any changes to the funding assumptions are in the process of being agreed by the Company and Trustees.
The funding position at 31 December 2014 shown is based on funding assumptions agreed for the 2011 valuation updated for the market conditions as at 31 December 2014.
The Scheme is valued for funding purposes at intervals of not more than three years by an independent qualified actuary.
The Group and the Schemes Trustees agreed a deficit reduction plan following the 2011 valuation and it was agreed that Brewin Dolphin Limited would pay contributions of 250,000 per month from 1 January 2013 with a view to eliminate the deficit by 31 March 2020.
Brewin Dolphin Limited has also agreed to pay contributions at 25.6% of pensionable salaries in respect of future benefit accrual for the in-service members of the Scheme.
From 1 October 2014, there is no longer any future benefit accrual following the retirement of the final in-service member.
The next actuarial valuation of the Scheme is due as at 31 December 2014, a revised level of contributions in respect of future benefit accrual for in-service members if any, and a revised deficit reduction plan will be considered as part of this exercise.
The administration costs of the Scheme, including investment management fees and Scheme levy payments are currently paid by Brewin Dolphin Limited as they fall due.
Summary of amounts recognised in the financial statements under IAS 19 In the consolidated financial statements, the Group accounts for pension costs, other post-retirement benefits and related redundancy provisions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Under the standard, the difference between the market values of Scheme assets and the present value of Scheme liabilities is reported as a surplus to the extent a surplus may be seen or deficit in the Balance Sheet.
The accounting value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis.
The accounts show the Scheme has a smaller deficit than that revealed by the last funding valuation.
The main reasons for this is the difference between the experience of the Scheme over the period from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2015 and that assumed for the purposes of the funding valuation as at 31 December 2011, and the differences in the assumptions used to value the liabilities in the accounting and funding valuations for the Scheme.
In the preparation of the valuations under IAS 19 referred to in this note, the actuary has used the assumptions indicated below, which the Group has directed for the purposes of accounting and disclosure under IAS 19.
133 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Overview Information Statements Report Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 27.
Retirement benefit obligation continued Risks The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the pension scheme are: Mortality risk the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the Scheme and consequently increases in the Schemes liabilities.
The Group and the Schemes Trustees review the mortality assumption on a regular basis to minimise this risk.
Investment risk the Scheme invests its assets in a diversified portfolio of assets.
There are risks that the assets underperform relative to increases in the value of the Schemes liabilities increasing the cost to the Group of the benefit provision.
There is a risk that the assets invested in do not sufficiently match the characteristics of the Schemes liabilities and so a fall in asset values is not similarly matched by a fall in the value of the liabilities.
While certain assets are chosen that match the characteristics of the Schemes liabilities and membership profile, the Scheme currently invests in a high proportion of equity and assets that are not expected to closely match the majority of the Schemes liabilities.
The Schemes Trustees review the performance of the assets and structure of the portfolio on a regular basis to ensure the risks being taken under investment are commensurate with normal Trustee principles and the ability of the Group to mitigate adverse investment experience.
Price inflation risk some of the Schemes benefits increase in line with price inflation and so if inflation is greater than expected, the costs of providing these benefits will increase.
The Scheme holds government bonds with payments also linked to inflation to assist in mitigating this risk.
Scheme investment strategy and level of matching The Schemes investment strategy is to invest broadly 85% in higher return seeking assets e. g. equities, high yielding bonds etc.
and 15% in matching assets e. g. fixed interest gilts and index-linked gilts.
The long-term objective is to target an investment return of 2.55% p. a. net of fees in excess of a portfolio of gilts that closely matches the behaviour of the Schemes liabilities.
The Scheme also has a liability matching overlay to mirror the majority of the movement in the matching portfolio.
This strategy reflects the Schemes liability profile and the Trustees and Groups attitude to risk.
The asset allocations as at 30 September 2015 and 28 September 2014 are provided below, disaggregated between assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that are unquoted.
None of the assets of the pension schemes are invested in the Groups own financial instruments and none of the assets are properties or other assets used by the Group.

Employees may use funds from their gross salary up to a maximum of 10% of their gross salary in regular monthly payments being not less than 10 and not greater than 125 to acquire ordinary shares in the Company Partnership Shares.
Partnership Shares are acquired monthly.
For every Partnership Share purchased, the employee receives one matching share up to a total value of 20.
All shares to date awarded under this scheme have been purchased in the market monthly: it is the intention of the Directors to continue this policy in the year to September 2016.
Deferred Profit Share Plan DPSP The DPSP provides for eligible employees to be required or invited to defer some or all of their annual profit share entitlement into an award over ordinary shares an Award.
Under the DPSP there is currently a mandatory deferral of 33% of any profit share in excess of 50,000 for a period of three years and additional deferral requirements for Executive Directors which are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Employees can elect to voluntarily defer profit share into the plan.
Awards are generally in the form of nil cost options to acquire ordinary shares, although at the discretion of the Committee they may also take the form of a conditional right to receive ordinary shares.
Awards in the form of mandatory deferrals made to the employees who leave the Group at any time prior to vesting lapse unless the employee leaves as a result of good leaver provisions.
It is the intention of the Board to recommend our Trustees to purchase the shares in the market for any shares awarded under this scheme in order to avoid dilution in the year to September 2016.

During the current period, these have been reclassified to provisions to better reflect the nature of these balances.
The Group recognises a provision for settlements of sundry claims and associated costs: settlement of 0.7 million 2014: nil has been made since the balance sheet date.
The timing of the settlement of the remaining balance is unknown, but it is expected that they will be resolved within twelve months of the year end.
The onerous contracts provision is in respect of both surplus office space and contracts associated with discontinued operations.
The valuation of an onerous contract is based on the best estimate of the likely costs discounted to present value.
Provision of 4.1 million has been made for surplus office space, which the Group may not be able to sublet in the short term.
The maximum exposure is the current estimated amount that the Group would have to pay to meet the future obligations under these lease contracts which is approximately 6.9 million as at 30 September 2015 2014: 14.4 million, if the assumption regarding sub-lets is removed and the time value of money is ignored.
The longest lease term covered by the provision has eighteen years remaining and accounts for 3.6 million of the provision.
Provision of 10.3 million has been made in relation to onerous contracts resulting from discontinued operations see note 13.
These costs arise over the term of the contract.
The contracts covered by the provision have a maximum remaining term of eight years, the maximum exposure is 10.7 million, if the time value of money is ignored.
The Group recognises a provision of 2.3 million for leasehold dilapidations.
These costs are expected to arise at the end of the lease.
The leases covered by the provision have a maximum remaining term of eighteen years.
