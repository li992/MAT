a Acquisitions i Friends Life On 10 April 2015, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Friends Life Group Limited Friends Life through an all share exchange which gave Friends Life shareholders 0.74 Group shares for every Friends Life share held.
In total, 1,086,326,606 Group shares were issued and commenced trading on 13 April 2015.
Friends Life is a leading insurance business which provides a range of pension, investment and insurance products and services to both individual customers and corporates.
Prior to the acquisition, Friends Life operated through three distinct divisions: the Heritage division which administers products which are no longer actively marketed for new business: the UK division whose main lines of business are corporate benefits, retirement income and protection: and the International division which provides savings, investment and protection products for customers in Asia and the Middle East.
The acquisition accelerates the Groups investment thesis of cash flow plus growth and is expected to benefit the Group over time through the realisation of significant incremental capital, financial and revenue synergies as well as supporting the Group to secure its position as a leading insurance and savings business.
768 million of the shares transferred to the shareholders of Friends Life represents the fair value of the liabilities, based on discounted cash flows substantiated against internally modelled and external market values, held by the Group related to the settlement of a pre-existing insurance contract between the Group and Friends Life held by the Friends Provident pension scheme refer to note 48.
The remaining 5,207 million represents the consideration exchanged for 4,536 million of net assets of Friends Life and 671 million of goodwill, as follows: 154 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 154 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 IFRS Financial statements 3 Subsidiaries continued Fair Value and Accounting Policy Book Value Adjustments Fair Value m m m Assets Acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets 3,055 2,219 5,274 Investment property 2,685 2,685 Financial investments 97,580 11,314 86,266 Reinsurance assets 1,254 11,251 12,505 Deferred tax assets 51 54 105 Other assets 2,619 854 1,765 Cash and cash equivalents 7,878 7,878 Total assets 115,122 1,356 116,478 Liabilities Insurance liabilities 36,068 12 36,080 Liability for investment contracts 68,778 129 68,649 Unallocated divisible surplus 724 724 Net asset value attributable to unitholders 212 212 Deferred tax liabilities 1,203 240 1,443 Borrowings 1,064 243 1,307 Other liabilities 2,355 668 3,023 Total liabilities 110,404 1,034 111,438 Net assets 4,718 322 5,040 Non-controlling interests NCI including tier 1 notes 329 175 504 Net assets excluding NCI 4,389 147 4,536 Goodwill arising on acquisition 671 Fair value of shares exchanged for net assets 5,207 Fair value of Group liabilities related to pre-existing relationship 768 1 Fair value of total shares exchanged 5,975 1 Fair value of consideration based on the opening market price on the date of acquisition.

Acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets An asset of 4,790 million was recognised upon acquisition representing the present value of future profits from the acquired inforce business AVIF as of 10 April 2015.
This will be amortised in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.

Fair value and accounting policy adjustments A reclassification of 11.3 billion was made from financial investments to reinsurance assets to align to the Groups presentation policy for reinsurance assets.
