These forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.
Forward looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, goal, believe, will, may, should, would, could or other words of similar meaning.
Undue reliance should not be placed on any such statements because, by their very nature, they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, and the Groups plans and objectives, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements.
There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward looking statements.
Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements are changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or dispositions.
