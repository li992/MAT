Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The increase in materiality from the prior year predominantly reflects the impact of the newly acquired entities on the Groups profit.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and, as the actual adjusted profit before tax figure was lower than that which we had used as the basis for determining materiality, we revised our materiality threshold to $4.62mn, which is approximately 5% of adjusted profit before tax.
Starting basis Profit before tax $85.36mn Write off of unamortised finance fees $2.61mn Adjustments One-off costs in respect of acquisitions $4.13mn Adjusted Profit before tax $92.10mn Materiality Materiality of $4.62m 5% of adjusted Profit before tax PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% 2014: 50% of our planning materiality, namely $2.83m 2014: $1.94m.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our expectation of misstatements, our risk assessment and changes in the organisation, particularly given the acquisitions which took place during the year.
During the course of the audit, we revised our performance materiality threshold to $2.31mn, which is 50% of our revised materiality threshold.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $0.46m to $1.50m 2014: $0.34m to $1.18m.
REPORTING THRESHOLD An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.28m 2014: $0.17m, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Given the revision of materiality we reported all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.23mn.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the groups and the parent companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
