In the transition to FRS 101, the following transition exemptions within IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards have been applied: the exemption from IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements such that the opening cost of investments in subsidiary undertakings has been taken as deemed cost being the extant UK GAAP carrying amount at the transition date.
The following disclosures have not been provided as permitted by FRS 101: a Cash Flow Statement and related notes as required by IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: a comparative period reconciliation for share capital as required by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries as required by IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: disclosures in respect of capital management as required by paragraphs 134 to 136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs as required by paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: an additional statement of financial position for the beginning of the earliest comparative period as required by paragraphs 6 and 21 of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: and disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel as required by paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.

IHG Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 145 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Companys functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional currency at the relevant rates of exchange ruling on the last day of the period.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, amounts due from and amounts due to Group undertakings and loans and borrowings.
Investments in equity securities Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost plus deemed capital contributions arising from share-based payment transactions less any provision for impairment.
The carrying amount is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Amounts due from and amounts due to Group undertakings Amounts due from and amounts due to Group undertakings are initially recognised at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
The carrying value is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash ows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Finance charges, including the transaction costs and any discount or premium on issue, are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings are classied as due after more than one year when the repayment date is more than 12 months from the period-end date or where they are drawn on a facility with more than 12 months to expiry.
Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to fair value at the date at which the right to the shares is granted.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using option pricing models.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which any performance or service conditions are fullled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The income statement charge for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises, in the Parent Company Financial Statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its Consolidated Financial Statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Treasury shares Own shares repurchased by the Company and not cancelled treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from retained earnings.
If reissued, any excess of consideration over purchase price is recognised in the share premium reserve.
