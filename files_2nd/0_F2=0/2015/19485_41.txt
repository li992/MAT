Where operations are not managed by Rio Tinto, the Ore Reserves are published  .

Summary data for year end prices, in calculating Ore Reserve estimates.
However, for US reporting, 2014 are shown for comparison.
Metric units are used throughout.
The the US Securities and Exchange Commission requires historical price figures used to calculate Rio Tintos share of Ore Reserves are often data to be used.
For this reason, some Ore Reserves reported to the more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those reported below.
small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource information in the tables below is tabulated figures.
