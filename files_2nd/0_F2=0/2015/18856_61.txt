Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit scheme surplus deficit The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is contracted out of the State Scheme, and a number of defined contribution plans.
The assets of the defined benefits scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
On 30 June 2014, the scheme was closed to future accrual.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 by a professionally qualified actuary.
The Group has agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of 1.7m per annum until 2021, although this will be reviewed at the time of the next actuarial valuation.
As a result of the actuarial gains arising during the year, the scheme is in surplus at 31 December 2015.
Management believe that the Group will benefit from the surplus and any future funding and an asset has therefore been recognised in the Group balance sheet.
At 31 December 2015, there were no active members 2014: nil, 370 pensioners 2014: 330 and 774 deferred members 2014: 837 of the scheme.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2015 2014 % % Discount rate 3.9 3.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.2 3.1 Rate of retail price index inflation 3.2 3.1 Rate of consumer price index inflation 2.2 2.3 At 31 December 2015, the mortality assumption used to determine pension liabilities is based on the most recent mortality tables which consider UK wide mortality data relevant to the Groups pension scheme.
The mortality rates are then adjusted to allow for expected future improvements in mortality using up to date projections.
The mortality assumption used a base table of PXA00 with future improvements in line with CMI 2012 1.25%.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2015 2014 $m $m Present value of funded obligations 249.7 293.1 Fair value of scheme assets 254.2 266.1 Net surplus deficit 4.5 27.0 The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 $m % $m % Equity securities 206.9 81.4 201.4 75.7 Corporate bonds 24.9 9.8 18.4 6.9 Gilts 13.2 5.2 19.4 7.3 Annuity policies 6.4 2.5 7.2 2.7 Cash 2.8 1.1 19.7 7.4 254.2 100.0 266.1 100.0 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2015 2014 $m $m Current service cost included within employee benefits expense - 3.5 Past service gain - 6.7 Interest cost 10.1 12.0 Interest income on scheme assets 9.2 10.2 Total included within finance expense 0.9 1.8 The employee benefits expense and past service gain are included within administrative expenses in the income statement.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 93 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit scheme surplus deficit continued Scheme risks The retirement benefit scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are Volatility The defined benefit obligation is measured with reference to corporate bond yields and if scheme assets underperform relative to this yield, this will create a deficit, all other things being equal.
The scheme investments are well diversified such that the failure of a single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the defined benefit obligation.
This would however be offset to some extent by a corresponding increase in the value of the schemes bond asset holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of benefits in deferment and in payment are linked to price inflation so higher actual inflation and higher assumed inflation will increase the defined benefit obligation.
Life expectancy The defined benefit obligation is generally made up of benefits payable for life and so increases to members life expectancies will increase the defined benefit obligation, all other things being equal.
Sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation The impact of changes to the key assumptions on the retirement benefit obligation is shown below.
The sensitivity is based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.
Assumption Change Impact on obligation Discount rate 0.1% $4.7m Rate of retail prices index inflation 0.1% $2.8m Rate of consumer price index inflation 0.1% $1.3m Life expectancy 1 year $6.6m Defined contribution plans Pension costs for defined contribution plans were as follows: 2015 2014 $m $m Defined contribution plans 78.8 89.6 There were no material contributions outstanding at 31 December 2015 in respect of defined contribution plans.
The Group operates a pension arrangement in the US for certain employees.
During the year, the Group made contributions of $0.8m 2014: $0.9m to the arrangement.
Contributions are invested in a portfolio of US funds and the fair value of the funds at the balance sheet date are recognised by the Group as a long-term receivable.
Investments held by the Group at 31 December amounted to $75.5m 2014: $71.7m and will be used to pay benefits when employees retire.
The corresponding liability is recorded in other non-current liabilities.
