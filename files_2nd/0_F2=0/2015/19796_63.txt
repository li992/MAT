These provisions are based on the least net cost of fulfilling or exiting the contract.
The calculation of the value in use of the leased property to the Group is based on the same assumptions for discount rates, growth rates and expected change in margins as those for Group owned properties, as discussed in detail in Note 11.
The provision calculations also assume that the Group can sublet properties at market rents.
For some leases, termination of the lease at the break clause requires the Group to either purchase the property or buy out the equity ownership of the property at fair value.
No value is attributed to the purchase conditions since they are at fair value.
It is also assumed that the Group is indifferent to purchasing the properties.
Based on the factors set out above, the Group has recognised a net onerous property provision charge in the year of 669m 2014: 18m charge relating to contracts in the UK of 561m 2014: 15 m release, Europe of 62m 2014: 27m charge and Asia of 46m 2014: 6m charge.
These provisions comprise obligations for future rents payable net of rents receivable on onerous leases and other onerous contracts relating to properties.
Of this charge, 536m 2014: 27m has been classified as Impairment of PPE and onerous lease provisions included within cost of sales, 120m 2014: nil has been classified as Impairment of PPE and onerous lease provisions included within losses profits arising on property-related items within non-GAAP measures in the Group Income Statement.
The remaining 13m charge 2014: 9 m release has not been treated as one-off and is recognised in losses profits arising on propertyrelated items.
Other provisions During the year, the Group announced cost saving initiatives including in the UK a restructuring of central overheads, simplification of store management structures and increased working hour flexibility.
The Group authorised a detailed formal plan of restructuring relating to these and announced the plan to affected employees, leading to recognition of a restructuring provision of 325m.
The remainder of the other provisions relate mainly to provisions for Tesco Bank customer redress in respect of potential complaints arising from the historic sales of Payment Protection Insurance PPI, in respect of customer redress relating to the historic sale of certain Cardholder Protection Products CPP to credit card customers and in respect of customer redress relating to instances where certain of the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act CCA for post contract documentation have not been fully complied with.
In each instance, management have exercised judgement as to both the timescale for implementing the redress campaigns and the final scope of any amounts payable.
The balances are classified as current at the year end.
