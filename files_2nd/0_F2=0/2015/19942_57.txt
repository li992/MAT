Share-based payments continued Fair value of share options and assumptions Share-based payment transactions and employee share ownership trusts ESOT The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefiting from the service of the employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included inassumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the Companys share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that areexpected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and acorresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or total shareholder return, would not result ina reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
The Group and Company provide finance to the ESOT to purchase Company shares in the open market.
Costs of running the ESOT are charged to the income statement.
The cost of shares held by the ESOT are deducted in arriving at equity until they are exercised by employees.
All share-based payment costs are recharged to the trading entities.
