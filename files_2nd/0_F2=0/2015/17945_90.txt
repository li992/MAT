Reconciliation of the effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate to the effective tax rate of the group on profit or loss before taxation.
With effect from 1 April 2015 the UK statutory corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% on profits arising from activities outside the North Sea.
For 2015, the items presented in the reconciliation are affected as a result of the overall tax credit for the year and the loss before taxation.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses, and for the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses in isolation.
For 2014, the items presented in the reconciliation are affected as a result of the tax credits related to the impairment losses recognized in the year and the effect of the impairment losses on the profit for the year.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate for 2014, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the effects of the impairment losses, and for the effects of the impairment losses in isolation.

Taxation continued For 2013, the effective tax rate is not affected significantly by impairment losses or the impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

However because there were profits in some countries and losses in others, the net impact on the effective tax rate reconciliation was less than 1%.
For 2014 excluding impairments, jurisdictions which contribute significantly to this item are Angola 50%, Trinidad 55% and the US 35%.
For 2013, jurisdictions which contribute significantly are Angola, the UK North Sea and Trinidad, with applicable statutory tax rates of 50%, 62% and 55% respectively.
b For 2015, this relates to the one-off deferred tax impact of the enactment of legislation to reduce the UK supplementary charge tax rate applicable to profits arising in the North Sea from 32% to 20%.
