Goodwill arising through business combinations has been allocated to individual cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing asfollows: 2015 2014 m m CGU Europe and the Middle East 195.1 195.1 North America 75.9 57.5 Brazil 2.3 3.3 Asia Pacific 19.3 19.3 PVM Oil Associates 54.9 51.9 347.5 327.1 Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of each CGU.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is the higher of its value in use VIU or its net realisable value NRV.
The key assumptions for the VIU calculations are those regarding expected cash flows arising in future periods, regional growth rates and the discount rates.
Future cash flow projections are based on the most recent Board approved financial budgets which are used to project cash flows for the next five years.
After this period a steady state cash flow is used to derive a terminal value for the CGU.
Goodwill has an indefinite life and this is reflected in the calculation of the CGUs terminal value.
Estimated average growth rates, based on each regions constituent country growth rates as published by the World Bank, are used to estimate cash flows after the budgeted period.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups WACC and are a function of the Groups cost of equity, derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM, and the Groups cost of debt.
The cost of equity estimate depended on inputs in the CAPM reflecting a number of variables including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated.
These inputs are based on external assessment of economic variables together with managements judgement.
As at 31 December 2015 VIU has been used to estimate recoverable amounts for all CGUs and for all CGUs, the estimate of the recoverable amount was higher than the carrying value.
The VIU calculations used annual growth rates of 2% for Europe and the Middle East 2014: 2%, 2.5% for North America 2014: 2.5%, 2% for Brazil 2014: n a, 3% for Asia Pacific 2014: 3% and 2% for PVM 2014: 2%.
Terminal values for each CGU assumed no further growth reflecting longer term forecasting constraints.
Resultant cash flows for Europe and the Middle East, Asia Pacific and PVM have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10.5% 2014: 10.5%, and for North America and Brazil have been discounted at 12.5% 2014: 12.5% reflecting the higher level of uncertainty in the forecasts of those CGUs future cash flows.
These calculations have been subject to stress tests reflecting reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.
All VIU calculations are tolerant to reasonably changes in the discount rate and are most sensitive to lower growth rate assumptions which reduce expected cash flows.
With zero growth all CGUs recoverable amounts were still higher than their carrying value.
At this level the recoverable amount for Europe and the Middle East exceeded its carrying value by 196m, which reduces to nil if growth rates fall to negative 4%.
The impact on future cash flows resulting from falling growth rates does not reflect any management actions that would be taken under such circumstances.
In 2014, the estimated recoverable amount for the Brazil CGU was based on its NRV resulting in an impairment of 6.8m to the goodwill attributed to that CGU.

Financial instruments continued d Credit risk analysis The following table presents an analysis by rating agency designation of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets, trade receivables and settlement balances based on external ratings.
At 31 December there was a nil net position on financial instruments at FVTPL Note 25 c. The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
None of the Groups financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk to a single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
Matched Principal brokerage transactions, whereby securities are bought from one counterparty and sold to another counterparty, are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
The above analysis reflects only the receivable side of such transactions, the other side being shown in trade and other payables.
Settlement of such transactions typically takes place within a few business days according to the relevant market rules and conventions and the credit risk is considered to be minimal.
e Maturity profile of financial liabilities The table below reflects the contractual maturities, including future interest obligations, of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31December: Due between Due 3 months between Due Due within and 1 year and after 3 months 12 months 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m 2015 Settlement balances 2,433.8 2,433.8 Financial liabilities at FVTPL 23.3 49.9 73.2 Trade payables 4.4 4.4 Sterling Notes July 2016 151.1 151.1 Sterling Notes June 2019 4.2 90.5 94.7 2,461.5 205.2 90.5 2,757.2 2014 Settlement balances 3,132.3 3,132.3 Trade payables 5.4 5.4 Sterling Notes July 2016 9.9 151.1 161.0 Sterling Notes June 2019 4.2 96.8 101.0 3,137.7 14.1 247.9 3,399.7 88 | Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information f Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the profit for the year with regard to currency movements on financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the year end.
Based on a 5% weakening in the US dollar and Euro exchange rates against Sterling, the effect on profit for the year would be as follows: 2015 2014 USD m EUR m USD m EUR m Change in profit for the year 0.6 0.5 0.8 0.6 The Group would experience an equal and opposite foreign exchange gain should the US dollar and Euro exchange rates strengthen against Sterling.
g Interest rate sensitivity analysis Interest on floating rate financial instruments is reset at intervals of less than one year.
The Groups exposure to interest rates arises on cash and cash equivalents and money market instruments.
The Sterling Notes are fixed rate financial instruments.
A 100 basis point change in interest rates, applied to average floating rate financial instrument assets and liabilities during the year, wouldresult in the following impact on profit or loss: 2015 2014 100pts -100pts 100pts -100pts m m m m Income expense arising on: floating rate assets 3.5 1.7 2.7 1.3 floating rate liabilities Net income expense for the year 3.5 1.7 2.7 1.3 h Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable forthe asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Share-based payments Share option awards As at 31 December 2015 the Group had one active equity-based long term incentive plan, the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan, forthe granting of non-transferable option awards to certain employees and executives.
Option awards granted under the plan typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options aresettled in equity once exercised.
Outstanding options at 31 December 2015 and their estimated fair values when granted are set out below: Awards Estimated outstanding fair value at 2015 grant date Awards Long term incentive award 2009 302,148 199p The following table shows the number of share options outstanding during 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 No.

Share-based Deferred Bonus Plan A Deferred Bonus Plan has been introduced for Senior Managers impacting the 2015 bonus year.
Under this Plan, employees identified as Senior Managers had 20% of their discretionary 2015 bonus award deferred into Equity.
As part of the introduction of the Deferred Bonus Plan, a Special Award was also granted to these employees.
The number of deferred shares reflecting the monetary value of these awards will be determined in March 2016 at the then market price.
The awards are subject to the completion of service conditions and the fulfilment of other conduct requirements.
Deferred shares under the 2015 award will vest in the period to March 2019 and those under the Special Award will vest in the period to March 2018.
Awards will be settled by the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 from shares purchased by it in the open market.
The fair value of the deferred shares equates to the monetary value of the awards at grant date and includes the value of expected dividends that will accrue to the beneficiaries.
At the year-end closing share price of 372.1p the estimated total number of deferred sharesunder both awards would be 1,679,375.
Acquisition related share-based payments As part of the acquisition of PVM, certain former shareholders are eligible to receive additional payments after three years service provided they remain as employees and PVM achieves revenue performance targets over that period.
The Group has the sole right to issue equity or cash to satisfy these additional payments, which although deferred consideration in substance, are conditional on future employment, and the fair value of the payments as at the date of acquisition, which was estimated to be US$48.0m 30.6m, is being recognised as a share-based expense, through the income statement and equity, over the three year service term.
The share-based expense recognised in future periods will be adjusted to reflect actual service and revenue performance.

Contingent liabilities The Company is currently under investigation by the FCA in relation to certain trades undertaken between 2008 and 2011, including trades which are risk free, with no commercial rationale or economic purpose, on which brokerage is paid, and trades on which brokerage may have been improperly charged.
As part of its investigation, the FCA is considering the extent to which during the relevant period i the Companys systems and controls were adequate to manage the risks associated with such trades and ii whether certain of the Companys managers were aware of, and or managed appropriately the risks associated with, the trades.
The FCA is also reviewing the circumstances surrounding a failure in 2011 to discover certain audio files and produce them to the FCA in a timely manner.
As the investigation is ongoing, any potential liability arising from it cannot currently be quantified.
In respect of legal matters or disputes for which a provision has not been made, notwithstanding the uncertainties that are inherent in theoutcome of such matters, there are no issues which are considered to pose a significant risk of material adverse financial impact on the Groups results or net assets.
In the normal course of business, certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover trading arrangements and or the use of third party services or software.

Retirement benefits a Defined benefit schemes The Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the defined benefit section of the Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme the Scheme.
In addition, there are a small number of schemes operated in other countries which collectively are not significant in the context of the Group.
The Scheme is a final salary, funded pension scheme that is closed to new members and future accrual.
For members still in service there isa continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
The Principal Employer is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contract-based policies of insurance.
The latest funding actuarial valuations of the Scheme was carried out as at 30 April 2013 by independent qualified actuaries.
The amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the Scheme are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Fair value of Scheme assets 289.8 255.7 Present value of Scheme liabilities 201.6 193.6 Defined benefit pension Scheme surplus 88.2 62.1 Deferred tax liability Note 19 30.9 21.7 The main financial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries of the Scheme to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2015 2014 % % Key assumptions Discount rate 3.70 3.70 Expected rate of salary increases 4.65 4.55 1 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 2.30 2.20 Inflation assumption 2.30 2.20 Note: 1 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive fixed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables and allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2013 funding valuation.
Assumptions for the Scheme are that a member who retires in 15 years time at age 60 will live on average for a further 31.4 years 2014: 31.2 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 32.8 years 2014: 32.6 years after retirement if they are female.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.

The effect of changes in the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions, assuming an independent change in one assumption with all others held constant, on the liabilities is shownbelow: Scheme Scheme Surplus assets liabilities deficit m m m As at 31 December 2015 289.8 201.6 88.2 Following a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate Change 0% 4.6% 10.5% New value 289.8 210.9 78.9 Following a 0.25% increase in the inflation assumption Change 0% 1.8% 4.1% New value 289.8 205.2 84.6 Life expectancy increases by 3 years Change 0% 6.6% 15.1% New value 289.8 214.9 74.9 Note: The above analysis does not reflect any inter-relationship between the assumptions.
Changes to the risks inherent in the Scheme would result in changes to the Schemes carrying value.
The most significant risks are: investment performance the liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set by reference to bond yields.
If assets underperform thisyield, this would result in the carrying value of the Scheme reducing: changes in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields willincrease the value placed on the Schemes liabilities: inflation risk some of the Schemes liabilities are linked to inflation, and higherinflation would lead to higher liabilities mitigated by a cap on the level of inflationary increases which protects against extreme inflationary increases : and life expectancy the majority of the Schemes obligations are for the life of the member, so increases in lifeexpectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
