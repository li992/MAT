Interest receivable on short term deposits is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive a dividend as scrip dividend, that is in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the dividend foregone is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the dividend foregone is credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.

f Taxation Irrecoverable overseas withholding tax suffered is recognised at the same time as the income to which it relates.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events have occurred that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of those transactions.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the capital column of the Income Statement.
h Valuation of investments The portfolio of investments is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented investment strategy.
Information about the portfolio is provided on this basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss, in accordance with the provisions of both Section 11 and Section 12 of FRS 102.
The fair value of investments is initially taken to be their cost and is subsequently measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, or last market prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
In accordance with the SORP the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains or losses on investments and has disclosed them in Note 10 on page 46. i Derivative instruments When appropriate the Company may utilise derivative instruments, including long and short CFDs.
Derivative instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss and are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: CFDs are valued at the difference between the strike price and the bid or last price of the underlying shares in the contract.
Gains and losses in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Income received or paid on derivative instruments is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Interest paid on long CFDs and dividends paid on short CFDs are charged to finance costs, in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on derivative instruments open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value either within current assets or creditors, as appropriate.
j Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Liquidity Fund plc, a short term money market fund investing in a diversified range of short term instruments.
It is a distributing fund and accordingly the interest earned is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
k Capital reserve The following are accounted for in the capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments and derivative instruments: Changes in the fair value of the investments and derivative instruments held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable Profits, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash at the Balance Sheet date, without accepting adverse terms, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held bythe Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash.
l Dividends Dividends declared and approved by the Company after the Balance Sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the Balance Sheet date.
Dividends are included in the financial statements in the year in which they are paid.

It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these amounts and, therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Ten New Ordinary Shares of 2.5 pence each were issued for each Existing Ordinary Share of 25 pence each.
The New Ordinary Shares rank pari passu with each other and are subject to the same rights and restrictions as the shares they replaced.
A holding of New Ordinary Shares following the sub-division represents the same proportion of the issued share capital of the Company as the corresponding holding in the Existing Ordinary Shares.
15 RESERVES The share premium account arose on the issue of ordinary shares.
It is not distributable by way of dividend and it cannot be used to fund share repurchases.
The capital redemption reserve maintains the equity share capital of the Company and represents the nominal value of shares repurchased and cancelled.
The capital reserve reflects realised gains or losses on investments and derivative instruments sold, unrealised increases and decreases in the fair value of investments and derivative instruments held and other income and costs recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
It can be used to fund share repurchases and it is distributable by way of dividend.
The Board has stated that it has no current intention to pay dividends out of capital.
The revenue reserve represents the net revenue surpluses recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement that have been retained and have not been distributed to shareholders as dividend.
It is distributable by way of dividend.
16 NET ASSET VALUE PER ORDINARY SHARE The net asset value per ordinary share is based on net assets of 760,304,000 2014: 724,977,000 and on 416,447,910 2014: 416,447,910 shares, being the number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end.

This Note is incorporated in accordance with FRS 102 and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Derivative instruments which could include long and short CFDs: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations.
The risks identified by FRS 102 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instrument risk.
The sensitivity analysis in this Note is used by management to measure the Companys exposure to these risks.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
MARKET PRICE RISK Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has a geared exposure to European equities through the use of long CFDs which incur funding costs and provide collateral.
It is, therefore, exposed to a financial risk as a result of increases in interest rates.
Interest rate risk profile The values of the Companys financial instruments that are exposed to movements in interest rates are shown below: 2015 2014 000 000 Exposure to financial instruments that bear interest Gearing effect of exposure through long CFDs 35,107 45,587 Exposure to financial instruments that earn interest Amounts held in margin accounts 3 607 Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc 8,800 4,038 Cash at bank 4,080 4,402 12,883 9,047 Net exposure to financial instruments that bear interest 22,224 36,540 Foreign currency risk The Companys total net assets and its total return on ordinary activities can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency, which is UK sterling.
The Company is also subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and derivative instruments: Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences: and Movements in rates affecting income received.
The Company does not currently hedge, by the use of derivative instruments, the UK sterling value of investments, derivative instruments and other net assets which are denominated in other currencies.

The Companys financial liabilities comprise the gearing effect of long CFDs, which have no fixed expiry date, and other short term creditors, that are repayable within one year.
The currency profile of these financial liabilities is shown below: 2015 gearing effect of exposure to long short term CFDs creditors total 000 000 000 Euro 35,107 3 35,110 UK sterling 1,872 1,872 35,107 1,875 36,982 2014 gearing effect of exposure to long short term CFDs creditors total 000 000 000 Euro 45,587 7 45,594 UK sterling 1,789 1,789 45,587 1,796 47,383 Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RISK The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are included within the other risk categories disclosed in this Note.
Derivative instruments are used by the Portfolio Manager for the following purposes: To gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial outflow of capital.
To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures benefit from falls in the prices of shares which the Portfolio Manager believes to be over valued.
These positions, therefore, distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and performance contribution of the derivative instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist Derivative Instruments Team which draws on over forty years of experience in derivative risk management.
This team uses portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Investment Manager on portfolio construction.

Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
COUNTERPARTY RISK All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Investment Manager employs, the Portfolio Manager will seek to minimise such risk by only entering into transactions with counterparties which it believes to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into.
The Manager ensures that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance and also adopts a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk through the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and evaluates derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For Over The Counter OTC derivative transactions, in accordance with the terms of International Swap Dealers Association ISDA market standard derivative contracts, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.

Limits are set on the amount that can be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank, outstanding securities transactions and derivative instruments at fair value.
