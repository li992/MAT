The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
As explained in section Q of the Groups accounting policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by Level 2 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.

The income tax expense for the year is based on the effective UK statutory rate of corporation tax for the period of 20.5% 2014: 22.0%.
The impact of changes in statutory rates in the prior year related principally to the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015.
In the Budget on 8 July 2015, the Chancellor announced additional planned reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 18% by 2020.
We expect the new rates to reduce the current tax charge in future years, however, as they were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, they have not been brought into account in calculating the deferred tax asset at 30 September 2015.
Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

Net short term temporary differences relate principally to provisions and other liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
After netting off balances within countries, the following are the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet: 2015 2014 NET DEFERRED TAX BALANCE m m Deferred tax assets 182 246 Deferred tax liabilities 28 39 Net deferred tax asset 154 207 Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences amount to 39 million 2014: 42 million.
Of the total, 25 million relates to tax losses which will expire at various dates between 2015 and 2022.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
The Group does not recognise any deferred tax liability on temporary differences relating to potentially taxable unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries totalling 370 million 2014: 448 million because it is able to control the timing of reversal of these differences.
It is probable that no reversal will take place in the foreseeable future.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five year period.
Budgets and forecasts are based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for anticipated revenue growth, from both new business and like for like growth and taking into consideration external economic factors.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.
2015 2014 Residual Pre-tax Residual Pre-tax growth discount growth discount GROWTH AND DISCOUNT RATES rates rates rates rates USA 2.0% 10.0% 2.5% 8.5% Rest of North America 2.0% 8.2% 2.0% 7.9% UK 2.0% 8.2% 2.0% 8.0% Rest of Europe & Japan 1.3-2.6% 7.6-16.0% 1.3-2.8% 7.4-16.5% Turkey 5.1% 14.0% 4.0% 12.8% Rest of Fast Growing & Emerging 1.9-5.7% 8.1-15.9% 1.9-7.8% 7.8-17.5% Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill for all CGUs.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management.
With the exception of Turkey, the directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the net operating assets of the individually significant CGUs disclosed above to fall below their carrying values.
The book value of goodwill attributable to Turkey is 70 million with a value in use of 97 million based on managements estimates reflecting the recent downturn in Turkeys economy.
Given the limited headroom of 27 million, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the value in use of the CGU attributable to this country to fall below the carrying value of its net assets.
Such changes include: a reduction in the level of cash generation of 16% as a result of, for example, a decrease of 2 percentage points in the revenue growth assumptions: or an increase in the assumed discount rate of 1.5%.

TRADE RECEIVABLES The book value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short term nature of the majority of the receivables.
Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been completed satisfactorily.
The policy for making provisions for bad and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors are considered, including how overdue the debt is, the type of receivable and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Groups client base.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for the impairment of receivables.
The book value of trade and other receivables represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Trade receivable days for the continuing business at 30 September 2015 were 41 days 2014: 41 days.

The Group has developed long term relationships with a number of financial counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required.
The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Groups policy is to match as far as possible its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are executed which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to the required currency.
The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into sterling.
Where the borrowings are less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate variances are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
Non-sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
The Group is only partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have little cross-border activity which might give rise to translation risks on trade-related balances.
The main currencies to which the Groups reported sterling financial position is exposed are the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen.
As set out above, the Group seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the Groups foreign operations in such currencies.
The effect on profit after tax and equity of a 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies on the Groups financial statements is shown below.
A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group.
This table shows the impact on the financial instruments in place on 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in exchange rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates on at least 80% of the Groups projected debt are fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
The sensitivity analysis given below has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in place at the year end date only.
The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Groups cash and cash equivalents and debt subject to variable rates of interest at the balance sheet date would be a loss of 6 million 2014: loss of 4 million over the course of a year.
A similar 1% decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

The sensitivity gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging may be implemented after the year end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above.
CREDIT RISK The Groups policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk arising from deposits and derivatives including forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps is concentrated at the Group centre where possible.
Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long and short term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength of the financial counterparty.
All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum short term credit rating from Moodys of P-1 or equivalent from another recognised agency.
The Groups policy to manage the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables is set out in note 14.
HEDGING ACTIVITIES The following section describes the derivative financial instruments the Group uses to apply the interest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies described above.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates.
These interest rate swaps all qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39.
118 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2015 19 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate borrowings.
These instruments swap floating interest payable on these borrowings into fixed interest rates and hedge against cash flow changes caused by changing interest rates.
The cash flows and income statement impact hedged in this manner will occur between one and three years of the balance sheet date.
These interest rate swaps do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 because the Group creates synthetic floating rate foreign currency borrowings see net investment hedges below through the use of forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps which IAS 39 disallows as being designated as a hedged item.
These interest rate swaps are an effective economic hedge against the exposure of the Groups floating rate borrowings to interest rate risk.
NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 2,613 million 2014: 2,519 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 18 million 2014: 41 million gain relating to the net investment hedges has been netted off within currency translation differences as presented on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
DERIVATIVES NOT IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include some interest rate swaps and some forward currency contracts.
Derivative financial instrument fair values are present values determined from future cash flows discounted at rates derived from market sourced data.
There were no transfers between levels in either the year ended 30 September 2015 or 2014.

Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed of businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short and long term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Provisions for reorganisation include provision for redundancy costs and these are expected to be utilised over the next year.
Other provisions include environmental provisions.
These are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2015 123 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2015 22 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS PENSION SCHEMES OPERATED The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups assets.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 1% to 39% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 84 million 2014: 85 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK SCHEMES Within the UK there are now three main arrangements.
The Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP, the Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan and the Companys stakeholder pension arrangement.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date but existing members of the Plan had continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Chairman, Nigel Palmer, is a current employee of the Group.
The other four trustee directors are UKbased employees of the Group, two of whom have been nominated by CRISP members.
The Plan is a defined benefit arrangement.
Those UK employees who transfer from the public sector under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 2006 are eligible to join the Plan, which has otherwise been closed to new entrants since 2003.
Such transferees enter into the GAD sections of the Plan and are known as GAD members.
The Plan closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than GAD members, on 5 April 2010.
The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
The Plan is operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Plan is carried out every three years.
The most recent valuation of the Plan took place as at 5 April 2013.
At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Plan was 1,808 million which represented 92% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
By agreement with the trustees, the Company has agreed to eliminate the 5 April 2013 deficit over a period of six years and three months to 31 December 2019 through monthly payments totalling 26 million per annum.
The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 5 April 2016.
The Plan is reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requirements.
The Plan has a corporate trustee.
The Chairman, Phillip Whittome, and one other trustee director are independent.
There are a further five trustee directors who are either UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by Plan members.
The Company became subject to the Pensions Automatic Enrolment Regulations for its workforce in the UK on 1 November 2012, but in accordance with the Regulations, deferred its staging date for automatic enrolment of eligible employees until 2 January 2013.
Both the Plan and CRISP are compliant arrangements under these Regulations and have been registered as such.
Employees who are not already in one of these registered compliant arrangements have been automatically enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust NEST.
The Company considers that NEST provides the right type of service, communication material and investment choice for our employees and that it has the capabilities to support a company as large and diverse as Compass.
OVERSEAS SCHEMES In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland, the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the USA.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 11 million in the year 2014: 10 million to these arrangements.
124 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2015 22 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED ALL DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES The Groups obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is then deducted.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality corporate bonds, whose term is consistent with the timing of the expected benefit payments over future years.
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which include life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases, and inflation.
It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using the projected unit method.
This method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowances for projected earnings.
These calculations are performed by a qualified actuary.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.
These have been calculated on the following assumptions: UK schemes USA schemes Other schemes 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.8% 4.0% 3.9% 3.9% 2.2% 2.5% Inflation 3.1% 3.2% 2.1% 2.3% 1.4% 1.7% CPI inflation 2.35% 2.45% n a n a n a n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.1% 3.2% 3.0% 3.0% 1.7% 1.7% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0% 3.1% 2.1% 2.3% 0.2% 0.3% Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.7% 2.8% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% This assumption is now presented as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the S1NA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males and 0.6 year age adjustment for females, with a long term underpin of 1.25%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in the life expectancy of scheme members.
The Group estimates the average duration of the UK Plans liabilities to be 18 years 2014: 18 years.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2015 2014 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2015 2014 22.6 24.5 22.5 24.4 Member aged 65 in 2040 2039 24.8 27.0 24.8 26.9 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
The mortality assumptions used to value USA schemes are derived from the RP2014 combined healthy table, generational MP2014 scale.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2015 2014 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2015 2014 21.7 23.9 20.9 23.3 Member aged 65 in 2040 2039 23.8 26.0 22.9 25.5 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2015 125 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2015 22 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED SENSITIVITIES OF PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS Measurement of the Groups defined benefit obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions, including discount rate, life expectancy and inflation.
The sensitivities of the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligations of the schemes are set out below: ASSUMPTION Change in assumption Impact on scheme deficit 2015 Impact on scheme deficit 2014 UK Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 168 million Decrease by 170 million Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 179 million Increase by 181 million Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 120 million Increase by 104 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 98 million Decrease by 99 million CPI Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 33 million Increase by 29 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 28 million Decrease by 29 million Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by 61 million Increase by 55 million Life expectations annual improvement rate Increase by 0.25% per annum Increase by 27 million Increase by 26 million USA AND OTHERS Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 20 million Decrease by 18 million Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 17 million Increase by 19 million Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 5 million Increase by 4 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 3 million Decrease by 4 million Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by 6 million Increase by 8 million The sensitivities above consider the impact of the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
The sensitivity analyses have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligations as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
The impact of a change in the UK inflation rate shown above includes the impact of a change in both the RPI and CPI inflation rates.
The Groups net pension deficit is the difference between the schemes liabilities and the schemes assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets.
These may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the schemes liabilities but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of certain assets so there is no effect on the Groups liability.
ANALYSIS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS At 30 September 2015, the assets of the various schemes were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equities and debt securities.
The fair value of these assets is shown below by major category: 2015 2014 UK USA Other Total UK USA Other Total FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS BY MAJOR CATEGORY m m m m m m m m EQUITY TYPE ASSET Global equities quoted 238 151 11 400 541 165 11 717 Global equities unquoted 12 12 12 12 GOVERNMENT BONDS UK fixed interest quoted 538 538 352 352 UK index linked quoted 818 818 625 625 Overseas quoted 8 8 14 6 20 Overseas unquoted 27 27 20 20 CORPORATE BONDS Corporate bonds quoted 387 107 494 278 68 346 Corporate bonds unquoted 2 2 2 2 Diversified securities quoted 7 7 9 9 OTHER ASSETS Property funds quoted 152 1 153 145 1 146 Property funds unquoted 12 12 13 13 Insurance policies unquoted 9 9 11 11 Other assets 9 9 5 5 Cash and cash equivalents 4 27 2 33 3 23 3 29 At 30 September 2,137 300 85 2,522 1,944 279 84 2,307 126 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2015 22 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The UK Plan has substantial holdings of diversified global equity type investments, mainly shares in listed companies.
The return on these investments is variable, and they are generally considered to be riskier investments.
However, it is generally accepted that the yield on these investments will contain a premium to compensate investors for this additional risk.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
In respect of investments held in global equities there is also a risk of unfavourable currency movements.
The trustee manages these risks by holding approximately 50% of those investments in funds which are hedged against currency movements.
The trustee also holds corporate bonds and other fixed interest securities.
The risk of default on these is assessed by various rating agencies.
Some of these bond investments are issued by HM Government.
The risk of default on these is lower compared to the risk on corporate bond investments, although some risk may remain.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value.

The executive and management options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.2 years 2014: 6.7 years.
No options were granted during the year.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.

The AFCF performance targets relating to LTIP awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2010 and 1 October 2011 were met in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to the participants.
For awards made in the year commencing 1 October 2010, the Companys TSR performance fell just outside the top quartile of the comparator group and as a result 96.1% of that element of the award vested.
The element of awards made in the year commencing 1 October 2011 dependent upon TSR performance targets vested in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to participants as the Companys TSR performance was within the top quartile of the comparator group.
The weighted average share price at the date of release for LTIP awards released during 2015 was 1,060.06 pence 2014: 938.50 pence.
The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years 2014: 1.5 years.
For the year ended 30 September 2015, LTIP awards were made on 27 November 2014, 6 February 2015 and 14 May 2015 for which the estimated fair value was 663.40 pence, 630.36 pence and 708.41 pence respectively.
For the year ended 30 September 2014, LTIP awards were made on 29 November 2013 and 9 July 2014 for which the estimated fair value was 582.03 pence and 653.22 pence respectively.

Where the Group enters into such arrangements, it does so in order to provide assurance to the beneficiary that it will fulfil its existing contractual obligations.

EUREST SUPPORT SERVICES On 21 October 2005, the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the relationships between Eurest Support Services ESS a member of the Group, IHC Services Inc. IHC and the United Nations UN.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it in relation to this matter in October 2006, but litigation continues between competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group co-operated fully.
The current status of that investigation is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities.
Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has, however, not been contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with these matters since January 2006.
The Group has co-operated fully with the UN throughout.
OTHER LITIGATION AND CLAIMS The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the nature of its business and maintains insurance cover to reduce financial risk associated with claims related to these proceedings.
Where appropriate, provisions are made to cover any potential uninsured losses.
In addition, the Group is subject to periodic tax audits and challenges with by various fiscal authorities covering corporate, employee and sales taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.
None of these are currently expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
OUTCOME Although it is not possible to predict the outcome or quantify the financial effect of these proceedings, or any claim against the Group related thereto, in the opinion of the directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group.
The timing of the settlement of these proceedings or claims is uncertain.
