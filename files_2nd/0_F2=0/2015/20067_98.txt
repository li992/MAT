Additional information 129 Alternative performance measures continued EBITDA In addition to measuring financial performance of the group and lines of business based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
EBITDA is defined as the group profit before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Within the lines of business we may also consider our performance using an underlying EBITDA measure, which additionally excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals and foreign exchange.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and adjusted group EBITDA, is set out below.
A reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
