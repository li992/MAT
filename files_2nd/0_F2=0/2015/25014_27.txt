Contractual arrangements The Group places reliance on a number of key suppliers to carry out its business and has procedures to ensure that purchasing decisions balance cost against other factors, including service quality, global reach and resilience.
The settlement of matched principal and exchange-traded businesses requires access to clearing houses either directly or through third party providers of clearing and settlement services.
In North America the Group is a member of the FICC and NSCC through which it clears US Treasury products, and agency, mortgage and equity trades for its customer base.
Clearing arrangements for certain US matched principal and exchange-traded transactions are outsourced to third parties.
In Europe and Asia Pacific the majority of the Groups clearing activities are outsourced to third parties where ICAP seeks to partner with one of the leading clearing providers in each market.

The programme covers all of the Groups activities, with a particular focus on the Global Broking division and Group infrastructure.
In the year ended 31 March 2015, 496 brokers and 244 infrastructure employees left the Company, which resulted in one-off employee termination costs of 35m.
Additionally, office spaces in key regions including London, New York and Singapore have been vacated and are currently being marketed for sublease.
As such, 18m of property exit costs including onerous lease provisions and associated moving costs were charged to the income statement.
This included a provision for onerous lease and associated costs of 17m, net of 3m of estimated income from the sublease of one of the properties.
As at 31 March 2015, income from subleasing of other properties could not be reliably estimated, hence the provision only reflects the present value of rental charges of the obligations over the lease periods of these properties.
In 2015 16, it is possible that some of the provision will be released when there are more certainties over income from the subleasing of the properties.
See note 16 for the provisions.
Other restructuring costs is primarily driven by 3m impairment of IT assets and 4m of legal and professional fees connected with the Group reorganisation.
Regulatory matters Regulatory matters include 11m provision relating to a 14.9m fine imposed by the European Commission for alleged competition violations in relation to yen Libor, in respect of the same underlying matters that ICAP Europe Limited, a subsidiary of ICAPs Global Broking division, settled with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC in September 2013.
ICAP has appealed and is seeking a full annulment of the Commissions decision.
The remaining 4m relates to associated legal and professional costs incurred during the year on regulatory matters, principally as ICAP continues to co-operate with the CFTC in their investigation into the setting of USD ISDAfix rates.

Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
The Group also calculates trading EPS from the trading profit.
The Group believes that this is the most appropriate measurement for assessing ICAPs performance since it better reflects the businesss trading earnings.
The diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting share capital in issue for additional weighted average number of ordinary shares that are likely to be issued under various employee share award schemes as at the balance sheet date.

Further information is contained in note 26.
Dividends payable The Company recognises the final dividend payable only when it has been approved by the shareholders of the Company in a general meeting.
The interim dividend is recognised when the amount due has been paid.

The directors have proposed a final dividend of 15.40p per share for the year ended 31 March 2015.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end, the total amount payable would be 99m.
Therefore, subject to shareholders approval of the proposed final dividend of 15.40p per share, the full-year dividend will be 22.00p per share, which will be covered 1.3 times 2013 14 1.5 times by the trading EPS of 28.70p per share 2013 14 33.20p per share.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee share trusts and no dividend is payable on Treasury Shares.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2015 113 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 7.
Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included in other comprehensive income or directly within equity respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and intangibles arising on consolidation, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Calculations of current and deferred tax liability have been based on ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities, managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were recorded initially, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

Employee information and expense ICAP operates a number of pension plans throughout the Group including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as they fall due.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset or liability.
The Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of its employee incentive schemes as well as other share-based payment transactions.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the grant date and is charged to employee expenses over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding amount is recognised in equity.

A matching award equivalent to half of the cash bonus is awarded.
These awards are subject to certain service and performance conditions.
The LTIP is a long-term incentive plan awarded to the GEMG members and certain other senior managers in the Company.
These share awards consist of basic and matching awards.
Under the basic awards, a certain percentage of the pre-tax bonus is deferred in ICAP plc shares for three years with no performance conditions attached.
The matching awards equal the basic awards, but are subject to certain service and performance conditions.
In the prior year, the vesting probability of the 2012 and 2013 LTIP and BSMP awards were revised down to nil, which resulted in a credit to the income statement.
Other share-based payment schemes includes 1m relating to new share awards this year in one of the Group subsidiaries, where the awards are in the shares of that subsidiary.

Interest rate risk exposure The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages through a combination of pound sterling, euro, yen and dollar debt drawn on fixed and floating rate terms.
The Groups objective is to minimise its interest cost and the impact of interest rate volatility on the Groups consolidated income statement.
In addition to debt, the Groups treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.

Net finance expense continued At 31 March 2015, after taking into account the impact of cross currency swaps and FX swaps, the interest rate profile of the Groups cash and debt was as follows: Year ended 31 March 2015 Year ended 31 March 2014 restated Floating rates Fixed rates Total Floating rates Fixed rates Total m m m m m m Pound sterling Cash 160 160 394 394 Debt 31 303 334 164 412 576 Dollars and currencies closely related to the dollar Cash 215 215 208 208 Debt 130 130 117 117 Other currencies Cash 106 106 96 96 Debt 3 82 85 94 94 Total Cash 481 481 698 698 Debt 34 515 549 164 623 787 A 100 basis-points parallel increase in Libor and Libid rates, which the Group considers to be an appropriate sensitivity measure, would decrease net finance costs by 1m in relation to pounds sterling and by 2m in relation to dollars.
In the event that Libor and Libid rates each diverge by an additional 100 basis-points, net finance costs would increase by 2m in relation to pounds sterling and by 2m in relation to dollars.
Company The Company is only exposed to interest rate movements as a result of a loan from a subsidiary of 140m.
It is estimated that the impact of a 100 basis-point movement in interest rates would have a 1m impact on the net finance costs of the Company.

To enable the Group to manage the translational exposure which arises as a result of the notes being denominated in euros and to meet its risk management objective of minimising both interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on its consolidated income statement, the Group entered into a number of cross currency swaps to convert its obligations over the life of 250m of the notes from euros to pound sterling at an FX rate of 1.21.
These swap from a fixed effective euro interest rate of 3.20% to a fixed pound sterling interest rate of 4.39%.
The swaps have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge and at 31 March 2015 have a fair market value of 28m liability 2013 14 1m asset and they offset the effect of FX on the notes.
This resulted in a nil charge 2013 14 nil being recognised in the consolidated income statement and a nil credit 2013 14 nil in other comprehensive income during the year.
The remaining 100m of the notes remain in euros and have been designated as a net investment hedge of the Groups euro-denominated net assets.

Capital and liquidity planning and management The Group does not seek to take proprietary market risk positions, so does not seek to expose its capital to market risk, and it does not undertake any form of maturity transformation so does not seek liquidity risk.
Thus the overall approach to the planning and management of the Groups capital and liquidity is to ensure the Groups solvency, i. e. its continued ability to conduct business, deliver returns to shareholders and support growth and strategic initiatives.
This risk profile meets the necessary conditions for an investment firm consolidation waiver and the Group continues to benefit from a waiver under the CRD IV provisions in force since 1 January 2014.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2015 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 12.
Capital and liquidity planning and management continued Liquidity Group The Group incurs exposure to liquidity risk as a result of trades executed as principal and trades executed on exchange on behalf of clients.
Since principal trades are executed as matched principal there is no net funding requirement in the normal course of business and the liquidity requirements arise only in relation to the margin and collateral requirements of clearing houses, either directly or via financial institutions that provide ICAP with access to the clearing houses.
In order to execute and clear matched principal trades in securities the relevant entities need access to clearing and settlement facilities, which requires access to credit during the settlement cycle, so typically only for a one to three-day period.
In order to execute trades in on-exchange derivatives the entities need access to credit facilities to carry the trades until they are taken up by customers.
In both cases, the Group can be required to post collateral or margin to support the credit lines, so access to liquidity is needed to ensure trades can continue to be supported uninterrupted.
The most significant margin requirements arise in the US where, as part of its Global Broking and Electronic Markets businesses, ICAP provides clearing services to customers and is required to deposit margins with the FICC and NSCC.
Trading entities of the Group use locally held highly liquid assets, predominantly cash held to meet capital requirements, together with committed and uncommitted credit facilities to meet their liquidity requirements.
The Group has a centralised approach to the provision of contingency funding for its trading entities.
Through the GFC, the board periodically reviews the liquidity demands of the Group and the financial resources available to meet these demands.
The GFC ensures that the Group, in totality and by subsidiary, has sufficient liquidity available in order to provide constant access, even in periods of market stress, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
Therefore, to meets its liquidity requirements, the Group has maintained minimum core liquidity, in the form of centrally held cash and undrawn debt facilities, of $250m throughout the year.
As at 31 March 2015, the Group had gross debt of 549m 2013 14 787m, the maturity analysis of which is set out in note 10, and cash and cash equivalents of 481m 2013 14 698m see note 11 c. Cash held at clearing houses, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, to which the Group has no immediate access in practice is disclosed as restricted funds in the financial statements note 11 f. The Group invests its cash balances in a range of capital protected instruments including money market deposits, AAA-rated liquidity funds, and government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to counterparty credit risk and liquidity.
With the exception of some small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong institutions which have an equivalent credit rating of A or better.
Company The Companys policy is to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of liquidity to enable it to finance its forecast ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
If the Company has any cash, it is loaned intra-Group for further investment.
With the exception of the retail bond of 125m repayable 2018, and the 15m bond repayable 2023, all of the Companys financial liabilities are payable within three months.
Capital management The Groups capital strategy is to maintain an efficient and strong capital base which maximises the return to its shareholders, while also maintaining flexibility and ensuring compliance with supervisory regulatory requirements.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt note 10 and equity, including share capital note 26, share premium, other reserves note 27 and retained earnings.
The Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient regulatory capital at Group level and in individual regulated trading entities to meet regulatory requirements.
The FCA has granted a waiver until April 2016 that allows the Group to disregard the application of the consolidated capital requirements of CRD IV and their requirements include the Group being prohibited from taking proprietary positions.
The Group continues to comply with these requirements.
The waiver modifies the calculation of the Group regulatory capital position and in effect excludes goodwill adjustments from the capital computation.
As a result of the waiver, the Groups Pillar 1 regulatory capital headroom represents the difference between the capital resources of the Company, on a stand-alone basis, and the regulatory capital requirements of the Group calculated, in accordance with the requirements of the waiver, on an aggregate basis.
Pillar 1 headroom is approximately 0.7bn 2013 14 0.9bn and is relatively stable due to the low amount of market and credit risk in the Group, but may fluctuate due to the timing of dividends and the distribution of subsidiaries profits to the Company.
Regulatory capital at solo entity level depends on the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and operates.
In each case the approach is to hold an appropriate surplus over the local minimum.
The highest capital requirements arise in the UK, where they are predominantly driven by the fixed overhead requirement, which is based on the fixed costs of the prior year and so does not fluctuate significantly within the year.
As the Group does not take proprietary positions it does not have an inventory of assets so regulatory capital is mostly represented by cash.
ICAP also evaluates at a Group and individual legal entity level the risks facing the business, to determine whether its capital is sufficient to cover any expected losses.
The Group uses a scenario-based model which assesses the economic capital required to cover expected risks.
The process followed at Group level is consistent with the CRD requirement for ICAPs FCA regulated entities to perform an internal capital adequacy assessment process ICAAP under Pillar 2.
The results for both are documented, updated and approved annually by the board and the UK regulated entity boards respectively.
The Group overall and each regulated trading company complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
124 ICAP plc Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance and directors report Financial statements Definitions 12.
Capital and liquidity planning and management continued Capital management continued In general, higher levels of market volatility can result in increased demand for the Groups services.
However, as the regulatory capital requirement is driven predominantly by the fixed cost base, the impact of changes in volumes on the capital requirement is significantly dampened.
As such, absent a material acquisition, loss of the waiver or a change in the computation basis, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to operate and to continue to invest in the development of the Groups businesses.
Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Capitalised expenditure is recognised initially at cost and is presented subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
Development costs are incurred and capitalised when a final development plan including the specifics of the assets to be developed is signed off by a committee with appropriate delegated authority including business management boards.
As part of the approval process, the committee considers the commercial viability and technological feasibility of bringing the asset into use.
When a project is abandoned in the development phase, costs are charged to the income statement.
Prior to this stage, costs incurred in the research phase including undertaking feasibility studies are recorded in the income statement.
Once an internally generated software asset is brought into use, any ongoing related costs are charged to the income statement to the extent that they relate to ongoing maintenance of the asset.
Where any costs are identified by an appropriately authorised management committee to be an enhancement to the original asset, these costs are capitalised and amortised over the remaining expected useful life of the asset.
The Group has an internal threshold for capitalisation of 5,000 for individual assets and 125,000 for software-related projects.
The key component of the development costs is compensation of employees.
Each of the Groups businesses and the Groups infrastructure area have their own dedicated IT project development teams.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.

ICAP plc Annual Report 2015 125 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation Since 1 April 2004, intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships and customer contracts that arose on business combinations.
The amortisation and any impairment is included in the consolidated income statement within the column Acquisition and disposal costs.
The Group reviews the performance of the acquired businesses and reassesses the period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to generate cash flows that exceed the carrying value.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries when the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree exceed the amount of the identifiable net assets acquired.
If the amount of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of investments in joint ventures when the cost of investment exceeds ICAPs share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is included in Investments in joint ventures and is not tested separately for impairment.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of interests in associates when the cost of investment exceeds ICAPs share of the net fair value of the associates identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included in Interests in associates and is not tested separately for impairment.
Where the Group makes an acquisition and the balances are reported as provisional at the year end, the Group has a measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the provisional amounts where new information becomes available about facts and circumstances that existed at the balance sheet date, which could impact the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on consolidation.
The measurement period ends as soon as the information required is received.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
ii Separately identifiable intangible assets The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate.
These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated initially at fair value and are adjusted subsequently for amortisation and any impairment.
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation are recognised in the second column of the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment.
Any reversals of impairment are credited to the consolidated income statement.
All intangible assets have a finite life.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 2 10 years Customer contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset for which the amortisation is non-tax deductible.
The liability unwinds over the same period as the asset is amortised.
iii Impairment Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indicator of impairment.
Goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation are allocated to a CGU at acquisition for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The identification of CGUs is reviewed where there is a significant change to the Groups segmental reporting structure.
Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of a CGU is based on the assets and liabilities of each CGU, including attributable goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use VIU.
VIU is the present value of the expected future cash flows from a CGU.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its VIU, an impairment charge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and the asset is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For goodwill, impairment charges previously recognised are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previously recognised impairment.
This process requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.

The other intangible assets at 31 March 2015 mainly represent customer relationships, and have varying remaining amortisation periods across CGUs.
During the year, goodwill and other intangible assets of 15m attributed to Global Brokings shipping business were reclassified to disposal group note 15.
The net carrying value of the disposal group including goodwill was tested separately and no impairment charge was recorded.
The individual CGUs goodwill, other intangible assets arising on consolidation and net assets were tested for impairment.
No impairment charge was recorded in the year.
The comparatives were restated as a result of the adoption of IFRS11 Joint Arrangements and IAS28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, therefore the goodwill attributable to joint ventures is now included within the investment in joint ventures note 22.

The pre-tax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital WACC ICAP allocates to investments in the businesses within which the CGU operates.
A long-term growth rate estimate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term nature of the businesses in the CGUs.
For the 2014 15 annual impairment testing of Traiana, managements cash flow projections for the three years ending 31 March 2018 were used.
For all other CGUs, management cash flow projections for the year ending 31 March 2016 were used.
In the prior year, consideration received from the sale of the minority stake in Traiana was considered as a proxy for Traianas fair value and was compared to net assets of Traiana including goodwill for recoverability assessment.

The Groups WACC is a function of the Groups cost of equity, derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM, and the Groups cost of debt.
The cost of equity estimate depended on inputs in the CAPM reflecting a number of variables including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated.
These inputs are based on the markets assessment of economic variables and management judgement, which are subject to scrutiny by the GFC and the Audit Committee see page 60.
All inputs to the CAPM model were externally sourced.
The CGU-specific WACCs were then derived by adjusting the Group WACC for business specific risk factors.
Nominal long-term growth rate The growth rate reflects weighted average real GDP growth and inflation for the countries within which the CGUs operate.
The rates are based on the International Monetary Funds medium term forecasts as they are deemed to be reliable estimate of likely future trends.
The rates applied do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy or, for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP.
Given continuing challenges, a nil terminal growth rate was applied for Global Broking.
Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU The cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans approved by the board of directors.
The key assumptions included in the cash flow projections of the CGUs are discussed below: BrokerTec BrokerTec cash flow projections show continued growth of the US Treasury Actives market and forecast improvement in the volume of US Treasury off-the-run trading.
The cash flow projections will be lower in 2015 16 as a result of the investment in a new platform.
The key challenges to the cash flow projections arise from potential increased competition in the US Treasury Actives market and from uncertainty around how regulatory reforms, such as higher capital requirements for banks, will affect the US and European repo markets.
EBS The key assumptions included in the cash flow projections for EBS are that the increase in revenue is driven by new EBS initiatives, upturn in market activity impacting EBS Markets average daily volume growth and other growth areas.
The key challenge to the cash flow projections is a worse than anticipated decrease in EBS Market revenue driven by a decrease in FX market activity.
Reset The cash flow projections for Reset are anticipated to remain in line with 2014 15.
Our ability to achieve the budgeted cash flow for Reset could be challenged if central banks continue their policy of quantitative easing QE, in particular the QE programme recently undertaken by the ECB, and low and stable interest rates.
The impact could be offset by some positive changes to the macroeconomic environment, specifically some sporadic or small increase in the volatility expectations around the US dollar and pound sterling.
TriOptima The key assumption included in the cash flow projections for TriOptima reflect muted growth as management believes that triReduce is a maturing business facing increased competition and thus reducing trading volumes on its core products.
TriOptima is anticipating the launch of new products which contribute to the cash flow projections in 2015 16, which over three years show increased growth due to investments to be made in 2015 16.
Traiana The three-year cash flow projections for Traiana up to 2017 18 were taken from the approved strategic plan for the CGU.
The key assumptions for the cash flow projections were continued growth in revenue along with improvement in operating leverage with volume increases year-on-year.
The key risk to the projections arises from certain technology risks, including capacity bottleneck and data security.
Global Broking The cash flow projections for Global Broking are based on managements assumption that the improvement in market conditions experienced in many asset classes in the later part of 2014 15 will continue in 2015 16 and the reduced fixed cost base is maintained.
The key risks to the 2015 16 cash flow assumptions arise from worsening market volumes and brokerage rates and the impact of short-term uncertainties arising from regulatory reforms continuing to be felt next year.
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date and having assessed sensitivities of the key assumptions, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of those key assumptions noted above would not cause an impairment in any of the CGUs.

Disposal group Disposal groups including both the assets and liabilities of the disposal groups are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale, they are available for sale in their present condition and their sale is highly probable.
Disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell, except for those assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Immediately before the initial classification as held for sale, the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the disposal group are measured in accordance with applicable IFRSs.
During the year, ICAP agreed to dispose of its shipbroking businesses to Howe Robinson Group Pte Limited for a 35% equity stake in the resulting combined group business.
The sale is expected to be completed in 2015.
As at 31 March 2015, assets and liabilities attributable to ICAPs shipping businesses formed part of the disposal group.
The fair value of 35% of equity in the combined group, net of disposal costs, is estimated to be higher than the carrying value of the net assets attributable to shipping.

Onerous lease provisions were recorded to reflect the present value of rental obligations on ICAP until the end of the lease period, net of estimated sublease income of 3m.
The present value of the provision is shown net of a discount of 1m.
As at 31 March 2015, sublet rental income for only one of the three office spaces could be reliably estimated.
The Group is looking at opportunities to sublet the other vacant office spaces.

Provisions continued Regulatory matters In February 2015 the European Commission imposed a fine of 10.9m 14.9m on ICAP for alleged competition violations in relation to yen Libor, in respect of the same underlying matters that ICAP Europe Limited, a subsidiary of ICAPs Global Broking division, settled with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC in September 2013.
Regulatory matters also include the settlement of 8m during the year with the SEC.
A provision of 8m was recorded as at 31 March 2014.
Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees The Groups contingent liabilities include possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of ICAP.
Additionally, contingent liabilities also include present obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that settlement will require the outflow of economic benefits, or because the amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of the outflow of the Groups economic resources is remote.
Judgements applied in concluding the appropriateness of contingent liabilities disclosure are confirmed after consultation with external counsel and discussions with the Audit Committee.
Contingent liabilities The Company and its subsidiaries continue to co-operate with the government agencies in Europe and in the US relating to their investigations into the setting of yen Libor.
The Company is no longer a named defendant in the US civil litigation against various yen Libor and euroyen Tibor setting banks.
However, the plaintiff in that litigation has been given permission to add ICAP Europe Limited as a defendant in that action, which ICAP Europe Limited intends to defend vigorously.
The plaintiff is also taking steps to appeal the dismissal of ICAP plc.
It is not practicable to predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries or the litigation.
As a result it is not possible to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group.
ICAP continues to co-operate with inquiries by the US government agencies into the setting of USD ISDAFIX rates.
During the reporting period, civil lawsuits were filed in the US against USD ISDAFIX setting banks, where a subsidiary of the Company is also a named defendant.
Those suits have now been consolidated into a single action.
The Company intends to defend these litigation claims vigorously.
From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation in relation to a variety of matters, and is required to provide information to regulators and other government agencies as part of informal and formal inquiries.
Details of regulatory and other matters that have a provision recognised for them are detailed in note 16.
Contractual commitments Operating lease commitments At the end of the financial year, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases which fall due as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2015 2014 m m Within one year 22 24 Between one and five years 64 71 After five years 17 30 103 125 The commitments include onerous lease provisions charged to the income statement in the year, but before the estimated receipt of 3m under a non-cancellable sublease as at 31 March 2015 2013 14 nil.
Operating lease commitments relate to the rental of premises for office space in the UK, US, Israel and Asia Pacific.
Guarantees In the normal course of business certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover clearing and settlement arrangements and or the use of third party services software.
It is not possible to quantify the extent of any potential liabilities, but there are none currently expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated results or net assets.
As at 31 March 2015, the Group has given 373m 2013 14 357m of guarantees to counterparties.
ICAP plc has provided a subordinated guarantee to a subsidiary company in respect of the $193m subordinated loan notes repayable in 2015.
The fair value of the guarantee at 31 March 2015 was not considered material.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2015 131 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently reviewed for recoverability.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against Operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are recognised initially at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is included in note 28.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity as principal in the commitment to purchase and sell securities and other financial instruments through two or more transactions between our customers.
Such trades have no contractual settlement date and are complete only when all sides of the transaction are settled, and therefore an aged analysis of matched principal trade receivables is not appropriate.
Substantially all matched principal receivables and payables settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of the trade date.
All amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross as matched principal trade receivables and matched principal trade payables note 19, except where a netting agreement, which is legally enforceable at all times, exists and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
If any unmatched trades remain outstanding, the asset or liability is held within matched principal trade receivables or payables as appropriate and fair valued through the consolidated income statement until the trade is completed.
The Group acts as an intermediary between our customers for collateralised stock lending transactions.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due to and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned note 19.
Financial instruments not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired.
The amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the consolidated income statement.

The Group does not bear any significant concentration risk to either counterparts or markets.
The credit risk in respect of name give-up and post trade risk and information services businesses is limited to the collection of outstanding commission and transaction fees and this is managed proactively by the Groups accounts receivable function with oversight from the independent credit risk function.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which are undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis.
The Group manages its credit risk in these transactions through appropriate policies and procedures in order to mitigate this risk including stringent on-boarding requirements, setting appropriate credit limits for all counterparts which are closely monitored by the regional credit risk teams to restrict any potential loss through counterparty default.
A significant portion of the Groups counterparty exposure at any given point throughout the year is to investment grade counterparts rated BBBBaa3 or above.
The Groups potential stressed counterparty credit risk calculated in the ICAAP is less than 5% of the Groups total capital resources.
The credit risk on core cash, cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are monitored on a daily basis.
All financial institutions that are transacted with are approved by the GFC and internal limits are assigned to each one based on a combination of factors including external credit ratings.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents is deposited with investment grade rated financial institutions.
Company The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
This risk is considered minimal as all counterparties are Group companies and the risk of non-payment is viewed as low.
b Impairment of other trade receivables Other trade receivables represent amounts receivable in respect of agency business and information services.
All receivables are individually assessed for impairment at the reporting date.
Management judgement is applied in determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred and, if so, the measurement of the impairment allowance.
In determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred, judgement is exercised in evaluating all relevant information on indicators of impairment, which is not restricted to the consideration of whether payments are contractually past due but includes broader consideration of factors indicating deterioration in the financial condition and outlook of customers affecting their ability to pay.
For those receivables where objective evidence of impairment exists, management determines the size of the allowance required based on a range of factors including probability of default and, if defaulted, expectation of recovery.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed and the reversal is recognised in the income statement.

There have been no new impairments during the year.
Past due but not impaired trade and other receivables are those in respect of which the debtor has failed to make a payment or a partial payment in accordance with the contractual terms of the invoice, but there is no major concern over the credit worthiness of the counterparty, therefore they are not impaired.
In the prior reporting periods, receivables past a normal settlement date were considered past due and were reported on that basis.

Investments in joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment under IAS39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Whenever application of IAS39 indicates that an investment may be impaired, the carrying amount of the investment, including attributed goodwill, is tested for impairment as a single asset under IAS36, by comparing the carrying amount with its recoverable amount the higher of VIU and fair value less costs to sale.
The Group adopted IFRS11 Joint Arrangements and IAS28 Associates and Joint Ventures for the financial year beginning 1 April 2014.

Whenever application of IAS39 indicates that an investment may be impaired, the carrying amount of the investment, including attributed goodwill, is tested for impairment as a single asset under IAS36, by comparing the carrying-amount with its recoverable amount higher of VIU and fair value less costs to sell.

The difference in these associates year ends to the Groups year end is not considered to have a material impact on their results.
All other associates have a 31 March year end.
Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Available-for-sale investments in equity assets that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, are subsequently recorded at cost less impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on such financial assets, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
All other available-for-sale financial assets are fair valued subsequently at each period end.
Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement for an investment in an available-for-sale equity instrument are not reversed through the consolidated income statement.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity investments are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
When an available-for-sale financial asset is derecognised, any cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised previously in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.
Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, cash-related instruments, and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures, are classified as available-for-sale.

Property and equipment Property and equipment is recognised initially at cost including the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into its intended use.
Property and equipment is subsequently presented at initial cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in its value.
It is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life as follows: Short leasehold property improvements Period of lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 5 years The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances.
These rates are determined on consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, a provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.

Currency risk management The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX and interest rate movements.
These can include forward FX contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs.
Where derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, along with transaction costs.
Where they do qualify, gains and losses are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments are determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis, as no active markets with quoted prices exist for the instruments held by the Group.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be documented clearly at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and, if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the accounting for the hedge relationship is terminated.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the consolidated income statement.
The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value being taken through the consolidated income statement.
For periods in which the hedge is shown to be effective, the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument that had previously been recognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign-denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedging instrument, whether it is a derivative financial instrument or a recognised asset or liability on the balance sheet, is consistent with the aforementioned treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign-denominated investment.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Group The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in pound sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the dollar and euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to FX risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenue and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-pound sterling operations.
The principal exchange rates which affect the Group are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
a Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for all subsidiaries to hedge their material non-functional currency transactional exposures through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
The majority of these exposures relate to dollar and euro sales arising in pound sterling functional currency companies.
The Group revised its hedging policy during the year such that, under the revised policy, a minimum of 75% of the forecast exposures are hedged for the first six months, 50% for the following six months and 25% for the next six months.
The Group has contracts in place, designated as cash flow hedges under IAS39 where appropriate, with a total notional value of 62% of its forecast dollar and 64% of its forecast euro transactional exposures for the year to 31 March 2016.
These contracts are at average rates of $1.6124 and 1.2655 respectively.

Currency risk management continued Group continued b Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local consolidated balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
Where material, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of these exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation as a result of the retranslation of the balance sheet of the Groups non-pound sterling operations, principally dollar and euro, into pound sterling, the Groups presentational currency.
The Groups general policy is not to actively manage these exposures, as active management using instruments with a shorter tenure than the underlying net asset can give rise to a net cash outflow.
However, from time to time it will use forward FX contracts, cross currency swaps or nonpound sterling denominated borrowings to mitigate these exposures.
As at 31 March 2015 the Group has $235m of forward FX contracts, the $193m subordinated loan notes, 100m of the 2019 five-year senior notes and the 15m 2023 ten-year senior notes, designated as hedging instruments against the underlying dollar and euro exposures respectively.
As at 31 March 2015 these exposures were $1.5bn 2013 14 $1.6bn and 0.2bn 2013 14 0.2bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.4bn 2013 14 $0.2bn and 0.1bn 2013 14 0.1bn of hedging.
The Group discloses in note 2 the actual impact and anticipated impact on the Groups 2014 15 operating profit from the movements during the year of the dollar and euro exchange rates in terms of transactional and translational exposures.
The table below shows the actual impact on the Groups equity of movements in the dollar and euro exchange rates in terms of transactional and translational exposures.
The table below also discloses the anticipated impact on the Groups equity of a 10 cent weakening, which the Group considers to be an appropriate sensitivity measure, in the dollar and euro in terms of transactional and translational exposure.

These include the use of forward FX contracts to hedge a portion of its transactional dollar and euro exposures and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the FX and interest rate risks on its senior notes.
Where these are designated and documented as cash flow hedges in the context of IAS39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and transferred to the consolidated income statement on derecognition of the underlying item being hedged.
