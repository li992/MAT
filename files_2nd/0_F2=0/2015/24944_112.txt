In applying judgement in recognising deferred tax assets, management has critically assessed all available information, including future business profit projections and the track record of meeting forecasts.
On the basis of this assessment, management expects substantially all the US deferred tax assets to be utilised by 2021.
The fall in net deferred tax assets since 31 December 2014 is mainly attributable to the reclassification of $1.2bn Brazilian net deferred tax balances to assets held for sale.
