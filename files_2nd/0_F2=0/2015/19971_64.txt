Fair value hierarchy The hierarchy as defined in IFRS 13 of the Groups financial instruments carried at fair value was as follows: 29 December 2015 30 December 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets liabilities held at fair value Forward currency contracts 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 Ante post bet liabilities 13.8 13.8 11.0 11.0 Total 0.1 13.8 13.7 0.2 11.0 11.2 Ante post bet liabilities are valued using methods and inputs that are not based upon observable market data and all fair value movements on the balance are recognised in revenue in the income statement.
There are no reasonably possible changes to assumptions or inputs that would lead to material changes in the fair value determined, although the final value will be determined by future sporting results.
The principal assumptions relate to anticipated gross win margins on unsettled bets.
Forward currency contracts are classified as level 2 in the hierarchy, as their value is determined using inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Changes in their fair value are recorded in the income statement, except in cases where the hedging arrangement qualifies for hedge accounting.
As at 29 December 2015, the Group had forward contracts outstanding for a total of 26.9 million Israeli Shekels at an average GBP:ILS exchange rate of 5.9 with final expiry on 12 April 2016 and forward contracts for a total of 98.5 million Philippine Pesos at an average GBP:PHP exchange rate of 68.6 with final expiry on 12 April 2016, which combined are valued as an asset of 0.1m.
