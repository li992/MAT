Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Property, plant and equipment continued The net book value at 31 December 2015 of the Groups land and buildings comprises freehold properties 3,155 million 2014 3,160 million, properties with leases of 50 years or more 327 million 2014 336 million and properties with leases of less than 50 years 196 million 2014 162 million.
Included in land and buildings at 31 December 2015 are leased assets with a cost of 756 million 2014 733 million, accumulated depreciation of 233 million 2014 226 million, impairment of nil 2014 9 million and a net book value of 523 million 2014 498 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31 December 2015 are leased assets with a cost of 31 million 2014 68 million, accumulated depreciation of 27 million 2014 17 million, impairment of nil 2014 2 million and a net book value of 4 million 2014 49 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
These calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash ows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specic risks.
For value in use calculations, where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash ow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash ows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 9%.
The net impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 109 million 2014 36 million, R&D 63 million 2014 11 million and SG&A 174 million 2014 47 million, and include 327 million 2014 nil arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.
The carrying value at 31 December 2015 of assets for which impairments have been charged or reversed in the year was 138 million 2014 225 million.

The acquisitions resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill which was allocated to Vaccines 576 million and Consumer Healthcare 774 million.
The disposal of the Oncology business resulted in a transfer of goodwill to assets held for sale in 2014 and a reduction in goodwill in Global Pharmaceuticals of 497 million.
This disposal was completed in 2015.
The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year-end exchange rates, is allocated to the following cash generating units: 2015 2014 m m Global Pharmaceuticals 2,826 2,774 HIV 126 124 Vaccines 1,003 487 Consumer Healthcare 1,207 339 Net book value at 31 December 5,162 3,724 The goodwill balance at 31 December 2014 has been reallocated to reect the revised cash generating units for 2015.

18 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model.
Fair value less costs of disposal is calculated using a discounted cash ow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows and terminal value.
The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specic country or currency risks.
The valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Details relating to the discounted cash ow models used in the impairment tests of the Global Pharmaceuticals, HIV, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less costs of disposal Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information.
Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes.
Terminal growth rates based on managements estimate of future long-term average growth rates.
Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate.
Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each region.
Period of specific projected cash flows Five years Terminal growth rate and discount rate Terminal growth rate Discount rate Global Pharmaceuticals 1% p. a.
7% The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets, reect the impact of future generic competition and take account of new product launches.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Goodwill is monitored at the segmental level.
The Global Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 240 million 2014 595 million.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit also comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 7.71 billion 2014 1.48 billion.
Details of indefinite life brands are given in Note 19 Other intangible assets.
