In May 2006 the group placed US$250 million at xed rates for periods between eight and twelve years, in 2014 US$50 million of this debt was repaid.
In December 2009 the group undertook a further placement of US$259 million at xed rates for periods between seven and twelve years.
In both placements the foreign currency amounts were immediately swapped into other currencies: Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
This is to offset the foreign exchange rate exposure arising on the groups foreign currency assets.
The conversion from US dollars into currency was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
All of these swaps have been designated as cash ow hedges, with the exception of one swap from the 2006 placement, which has been designated as a fair value hedge, this swap was repaid in 2014.
In the second stage further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The xed interest rate cross-currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
