leniency is applied to newly opened stores and to stores in new territories for the brand.
Given the relative immaturity of the brand outside the UK, the payback period is typically longer and it is not uncommon for new stores to make losses in their start up phase.
The directors have used forecast models and an appropriate pre-tax weighted average cost of capital in its property, plant and equipment impairment calculations.
Inventory valuation: The directors have used their knowledge and experience of the fashion industry in determining the level and rates of provisioning required to calculate the appropriate inventory carrying values.
Inventory is carried in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Sales in the fashion industry can be extremely volatile with consumer demand changing significantly based on current trends.
As a result there is a risk that the cost of inventory exceeds its net realisable value.
Management calculate the inventory provision on the basis of the ageing profile of what is in stock.
Adjustments are made where appropriate based on directors knowledge and experience to calculate the appropriate inventory carrying values.
W NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES Exceptional items are those items which, in the opinion of the directors, should be excluded in order to provide a consistent and comparable view of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Generally this will include those items that are largely one-off and material in nature.
Exceptional items are identified and presented on a consistent basis each year and a reconciliation of PBT before exceptional items to profit before tax is included in the financial statements.
