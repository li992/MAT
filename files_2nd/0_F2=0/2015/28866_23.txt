Impaired loans are all loans including loans subject to forbearance for which an impairment provision has been established: for collectively assessed loans, impairment loss provisions are not allocated to individual loans and the entire portfolio is included in impaired loans.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more comprises loans past due 90 days where no impairment loss is expected.
The coverage ratio reduces if the loan written-off carries a higher than average provision and increases if the loan written-off carries a lower than average provision.
2 Impaired loans at 31 December 2015 include 2,300 million 2014 - 7,052 million: 2013 - 7,687 million of loans subject to forbearance granted during the year.

This category is used for advances which are not past due 90 days or revolving credit facilities where identification as 90 days overdue is not feasible.
2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 m m m m m Potential problem loans 1,277 1,206 789 807 739 Both REIL and PPL are reported gross and take no account of the value of any security held which could reduce the eventual loss should it occur, nor of any provision marked.
Therefore impaired assets which are highly collateralised, such as mortgages, will have a low coverage ratio of provisions held against the reported impaired balance.
384 Additional information Forbearance The table below shows loans granted forbearance during the year.
These loans are unimpaired: either the loan was performing before and after the granting of forbearance or the loan was non-performing before but subsequently transferred to the performing book.
Loans with impairment provisions subject to forbearance continue to be reported as impaired loans.

Unsecured retail loans subject to forbearance amounting to 96 million 2014 - 244 million: 2013 - 272 million are not included.
Cross border exposures Cross border exposures are loans and advances including finance leases and instalment credit receivables and other monetary assets, such as debt securities, including non-local currency claims of overseas offices on local residents.
RBS monitors the geographical breakdown of these exposures based on the country of domicile of the borrower or guarantor of ultimate risk.
Cross border exposures exclude exposures to local residents in local currencies.
The table below sets out cross border exposures greater than 0.5% of RBSs total assets.
None of these countries have experienced repayment difficulties that have required restructuring of outstanding debt.

Weighted average interest rates at year end are for a single day and as such may reflect one-day market distortions, which may not be indicative of generally prevailing rates.
