Income access share IAS arrangements As its ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Company has a large number of UK resident shareholders.
In order that shareholders may receive Experian dividends from a UK source, should they wish, the IAS arrangements have been put in place.
The purpose of the IAS arrangements is to preserve the tax treatment of dividends paid to Experian shareholders in the UK, in respect of dividends paid by the Company.
Shareholders who elect, or are deemed to elect, to receive their dividends via the IAS arrangements will receive their dividends from a UK source rather than directly from the Company for UK tax purposes.
Shareholders who hold 50,000 or fewer Experian shares on the first dividend record date after they become shareholders, unless they elect otherwise, will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the IAS arrangements.
Shareholders who hold more than 50,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make an election to receive dividends via the IAS arrangements.
All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked.
Unless shareholders have made an election to receive dividends via the IAS arrangements, or are deemed to have made such an election, dividends will be received from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP The DRIP enables those shareholders who receive their dividends under the IAS arrangements to use their cash dividends to buy more shares in the Company.
Eligible shareholders, who wish to participate in the DRIP in respect of the second interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015 to be paid on 24 July 2015, should return a completed and signed DRIP application form, to be received by the registrars no later than 26 June 2015.
Shareholders should contact the registrars for further details.
Capital Gains Tax CGT base cost for UK shareholders On 10 October 2006, GUS plc separated its Experian business from its Home Retail Group business by way of demerger.
GUS plc shareholders were entitled to receive one share in Experian plc and one share in Home Retail Group plc for every share they held in GUS plc.
The base cost of any GUS plc shares held at demerger is apportioned for UK CGT purposes in the ratio 58.235% to Experian plc shares and 41.765% to Home Retail Group plc shares.
This is based on the closing prices of the respective shares on their first day of trading after their admission to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 11 October 2006.
For GUS plc shares acquired prior to the demerger of Burberry on 13 December 2005, which are affected by both the Burberry demerger and the subsequent separation of Experian and Home Retail Group, the original CGT base cost is apportioned 50.604% to Experian plc shares, 36.293% to Home Retail Group plc shares and 13.103% to Burberry Group plc shares.
