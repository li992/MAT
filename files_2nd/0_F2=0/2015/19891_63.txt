GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS GOODWILL Goodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations see note 21.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment.
The Groups cash generating units CGUs are based on the four product categories and the three geographical areas.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Groups CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
These might not always be the same as the CGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than an operating segment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Separately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill.
Intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Finite-life intangible assets mainly comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how and software.
These assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter.
None of the amortisation periods exceeds ten years.
Indefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands.
These assets are capitalised at cost but are not amortised.
They are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Internally produced intangibles generally are not capitalised unless it can be demonstrated that the recognition criteria are met.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Development expenditure is capitalised only if the costs can be reliably measured, future economic benefits are probable, the product is technically feasible and the Group has the intent and the resources to complete the project.
Research expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
