Notes on the Financial Statements continued 25 Financial liabilities at FV 26 Debt securities 27 Accruals 28 Liabilities under insurance contracts 25 Financial liabilities designated at fair value Accounting policy The criteria for designating instruments at fair value and their measurement are described in Note 15.
The fair value designation, once made, is irrevocable.
Designated financial liabilities are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties and are normally derecognised when extinguished.
Examples of such designations include: Long-term debt issues The interest and or foreign exchange exposure on certain fixed rate debt securities issued has been matched with the interest and or foreign exchange exposure on certain swaps as part of a documented risk management strategy.
An accounting mismatch would arise if the debt securities issued were accounted for at amortised cost, and this mismatch is eliminated through the fair value designation.
Financial liabilities under unit-linked and non-linked investment contracts HSBC issues contracts to customers that contain insurance risk, financial risk or a combination thereof.
A contract under which HSBC accepts insignificant insurance risk from another party is not classified as an insurance contract, but is accounted for as a financial liability.
See Note 28 for contracts where HSBC accepts significant insurance risk.
Customer liabilities under linked and certain non-linked investment contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries and the corresponding financial assets are designated at fair value.
Liabilities are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value which is calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices.
Premiums receivable and amounts withdrawn are accounted for as increases or decreases in the liability recorded in respect of investment contracts.
The incremental costs directly related to the acquisition of new investment contracts or renewing existing investment contracts are deferred and amortised over the period during which the investment management services are provided.

26 Debt securities in issue Accounting policy Financial liabilities for debt securities issued are recognised when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties and are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities, other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss and financial guarantees, is at amortised cost, using the effective interest method to amortise the difference between proceeds received, net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred, and the redemption amount over their expected life.
