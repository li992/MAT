I: Interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements I1: Subsidiaries Critical accounting estimates and judgements Consolidation set of standards The Group has applied the following key judgements in the application of the requirements of the consolidation set of standards IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements : Consolidation of investment funds and securitisation vehicles The Group acts as a fund manager to a number of investment funds.
In determining whether the Group controls such a fund, it will focus on an assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group comprising any carried interests and expected management fees and the investors rights to remove the fund manager.
The Group assesses, on an annual basis, such interests to determine if the fund will be consolidated.
See note I3 b in the Annual Report and Accounts for disclosures in respect of the investment funds in which the Group has an interest.
The Group has sponsored certain asset-backed financing securitisation vehicles under its securitisation programme which are run according to pre-determined criteria that are part of the initial design of the vehicles.
The Group is exposed to variability of returns from the vehicles through its holding of junior debt securities in the vehicles.
It has concluded that it controls these vehicles and therefore has consolidated these asset-backed financing vehicles.
Structured entities The Group is required to make judgements on what constitutes a structured entity.
Accounting standards define a structured entity as an entity designed so that its activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such investees in which it has an economic interest, the Group considers numerous factors.
These factors may include the purpose and design of the investee, its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee, the nature of its relationship with the investee and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the investee.
The Group has evaluated all exposures and has concluded that all investments in investment funds as well as certain securitisation vehicles and other funding vehicles represent investments in structured entities.
Information on structured entities is included in note I3.

2 The Group has concluded that, while the market value based on the share price of ETI is below its carrying value, this decline is neither significant nor prolonged.
However, recent macro-economic events in the countries in which ETI operates have been considered and it has been determined that an indicator of potential impairment exists as at 31 December 2015.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the impairment test compares the estimated recoverable amount and the carrying value of the investment.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use.
If the value in use is lower than the carrying value, the carrying value is impaired to the value in use basis, with the resulting impairment loss reported within other operating expenses.
As ETIs value in use at 31 December 2015 exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss has been recognised.

OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 260 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2015 I: Interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements continued I3: Structured entities continued b Consolidation considerations for structured entities In structured entities voting rights are not the predominant factor in deciding who controls the entity but rather the Groups exposure to the variability of returns from these entities.
The Group acts as fund manager to a number of investment funds.
Determining whether the Group controls such an investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of decision making rights as fund manager, the investors rights to remove the fund manager and the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the fund in the form of interest held and exposure to variable returns.
In most instances the Groups decision making authority, in its capacity as fund manager, with regard to these funds is regarded to be well-defined.
Discretion is exercised when decisions regarding the relevant activities of these funds are being made.
For funds managed by the Group where the investors have the right to remove the Group as fund manager without cause, the fees earned by the Group, are considered to be market related.
These agreements include only terms, conditions or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services and level of skills negotiated on an arms-length basis.
The Group has concluded that it acts as agent on behalf of the investors in all instances.
The Group is considered to be acting as principal where the Group is the fund manager and is able to make the investment decisions on behalf of the unit holders to earn a variable fee, and there are no kick out rights that would remove the Group as fund manager.
There have been no changes in facts or circumstances which have changed the Groups conclusion on the consolidation of funds.
The Group has not provided any non-contractual support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group has committed to providing certain liquidity facilities for certain securitisation vehicles.
Disclosure of consolidated securitisation vehicles, which are structured entities, is included in note I3 c. c Securitisation vehicles consolidated in the Groups statement of financial position Nedbank Securitisations Nedbank Group Limited uses securitisation primarily as a funding diversification tool and to add flexibility in mitigating structural liquidity risk.
The Group currently has four active traditional securitisation transactions: Synthesis Funding Ltd Synthesis, an asset-backed commercial paper ABCP programme launched in 2004 Greenhouse Funding RF Ltd, Greenhouse, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme Greenhouse Funding III RF Ltd, Greenhouse III, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme and Precinct Funding 1 RF Ltd Precinct, a commercial mortgage-backed securitisation programme.
Nedbank Group also has two active Committed Liquidity Facility CLF transactions: West Road South No.
3 RF Ltd, West Road South, a commercial mortgage-backed CLF programme launched in 2014, with R14.5 billion assets transferred into the programme and Greenhouse Funding 4 RF Ltd, Greenhouse 4, a residential mortgage-backed CLF programme launched in 2015, with R3.1 billion assets transferred into the programme.
Synthesis Funding Ltd Synthesis primarily invests in long-term rated bonds and offers capital market funding to South African corporates.
These assets are funded through the issuance of short-dated investment grade commercial paper to institutional investors.
All the commercial paper issued by Synthesis is assigned the highest short-term RSA local-currency credit rating by Fitch, and is listed on JSE Ltd.
Liquidity facilities have been obtained from a F1 zaf rated bank in order to ensure the availability of sufficient funds in instances where timing mismatches could occur.
These timing mismatches refer to the possible mismatch between the receipt of funds relating to financial assets and disbursement of funds relating to the redemption of financial liabilities.
These liquidity facilities cover the nominal value of the commercial paper it is issued against and exceed the maturity date of the underlying financial liability by five days.
Synthesis is a partially-supported conduit whose credit support is dependent on transaction-specific credit enhancement as well as available programme-wide credit enhancement PWCE provided by Nedbank.
PWCE is calculated as 5% of the aggregate book value of financial assets excluding defaults plus a dynamic percentage based on the credit quality of the underlying portfolio of the rated securities.
If a rated security falls below AAzaf, Synthesis must either remove the asset from the portfolio, obtain a guarantee by an entity rated at least AAzaf or Nedbank must post PWCE within 15 business days.
Currently, there are no financial assets in the conduit portfolio and all rated securities are rated at least AAzaf or are guaranteed by Nedbank if rated below AAzaf.
As a result, no PWCE is currently required in accordance with Synthesis transaction documentation.
In terms of assets not meeting the AAzaf requirement, Nedbank guarantees an aggregate amount of R850 million 37 million as at 31 December 2015.

Greenhouse was subsequently restructured and refinanced on 19 November 2012 as a static amortising structure.
The proceeds from the refinance of this transaction, through the issuance of new notes and subordinated loans, was utilised to repay the R1.3 billion 57 million existing notes and subordinated loans upon their scheduled maturity, and to acquire additional home loans from Nedbank Limited.

Greenhouse III, a second standalone RMBS programme, was implemented during 2014.
Greenhouse III is a securitisation vehicle that acquires the rights, title, interest and related security of residential home loans from Nedbank Limited under a segregated series medium term note programme.
In April 2015 Greenhouse III securitised R2.0 billion 88 million worth of home loans originated by Nedbank Limited, through the issuance of senior notes to the capital market, and subordinated notes and subordinate loan provided by Nedbank Limited.
The notes issued by Greenhouse III are listed on the JSE Ltd and rated by Fitch.
The Greenhouse vehicles make use of an internal risk management policy, and utilises the Nedbank Group Limited credit risk monitoring process to govern lending activities to external parties.
In addition financial assets may only be introduced into the programme provided they meet certain eligibility criteria prescribed by the programme agreements.
Nedbank has provided the Greenhouse Programmes with interest bearing subordinated loans at the commencement of each programme, in order to provide part of the initial funding.
Interest is payable on a quarterly basis, as part of the priority of payments.
The full capital amount outstanding plus any accrued interest will be payable in full on the final termination date, provided that all outstanding notes have been redeemed in full and all secured creditors have been settled.
In the Greenhouse structure, Nedbank holds the C and Y notes amounting to R113 million 5 million and in the Greenhouse III structure, Nedbank holds the D note, amounting to R100 million 4 million.
These notes rank subordinated to the A and B notes in terms of the priority of payments.

The originator, seller and servicer of the commercial property loan portfolio is Nedbank Corporate Property Finance, the market leader in commercial property finance in South Africa.
The Precinct structure takes the form of a static pool of small commercial property loans with limited substitution and redraws further advance capabilities.
Precinct has issued notes rated by Moodys Investors Service and listed on the JSE Ltd.
The A and B notes were placed to third party investors and the junior notes and subordinated loan retained by the Group.
The vehicle makes use of an internal risk management policy and utilises the Nedbank Group credit risk monitoring process to govern lending activities to external parties.
The primary measures used to identify, monitor and report on the level of exposure to credit risk include individual loan and loan portfolio ageing and performance analysis, analysis of impairment adequacy ratios, analysis of loss ratio trends and analysis of loan portfolio profitability.
The maximum credit exposure to credit risk in respect of the mortgage loans is the balance of outstanding advances before taking into account the value of collateral held as security against such exposures and impairments raised.
The collateral held as security for the mortgage asset exposure is in the form of first indemnity bonds over fixed commercial property.
Nedbank has provided Precinct with an interest-bearing subordinated loan at the commencement of this transaction, in order to provide part of the initial funding.
Nedbank holds the C and D notes amounting to R225 million 10 million, which rank subordinated to the A and B notes in terms of the priority of payments.
