There are 25 corporate groups in the FII GLO.
The case concerns the treatment for UK corporation tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
The claim was filed in 2003 and the case was heard in the European Court of Justice ECJ in 2005 and a decision of the ECJ received in December 2006.
In July 2008, the case reverted to a trial in the UK High Court for the UK Court to determine how the principles of the ECJ decision should be applied in a UK context.
The High Court judgment in November 2008 concluded, among other things, that the corporation tax provisions relating to dividend income from EU subsidiaries breached EU law.
It also concluded that certain dividends received before 5 April 1999 from the EU and, in some limited circumstances after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been creditable against advance corporation tax ACT liabilities with the consequence that ACT need not have been paid.
Claims for the repayment of UK tax incurred where the dividends were from the EU were allowed back to 1973.
The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2009 and the judgment handed down on 23 February 2010.
The Court of Appeal determined that various questions, including which companies in the corporate tree can be included in a claim, should be referred back to the ECJ for further clarification.
In addition, the Court determined that the claim should be restricted to six years and not cover claims dating back to 1973.
The issue of time limits was heard by the Supreme Court in February 2012 and in May 2012 the Supreme Court decided in British American Tobacco Groups favour, that claims submitted before 8 September 2003 can go back to 1973.
A hearing took place in February 2012 at the ECJ on the questions referred from the Court of Appeal.
The ECJ judgment of 13 November 2012 confirms that the UK treatment of EU dividends was discriminatory and produces the same outcome for third country dividends from 1994 in certain circumstances.
The judgment also confirms that the claim can cover dividends from all indirect as well as direct EU subsidiaries and also ACT paid by a superior holding company.
The detailed technical issues of the quantification mechanics of the claim were heard by the High Court during May and June 2014 and the judgment handed down on 18 December 2014.
The High Court determined that in respect of issues concerning the calculation of unlawfully charged corporation tax and ACT, the law of restitution including the defence on change of position and questions concerning the calculation of overpaid interest, the approach of the British American Tobacco Group was broadly preferred.
The conclusion reached by the High Court would, if upheld, produce an estimated receivable of 1.2 billion for British American Tobacco.
Appeals on a majority of the issues have been made to the Court of Appeal, which is likely to hear the case in 2016.
During 2015, HMRC paid to the Group a gross amount of 1,224 million in two separate payments.
The payments made by HMRC have been made without any admission of liability and are subject to refund were HMRC to succeed on appeal.
The second payment in November 2015 followed the introduction of a new 45% tax on the interest component of restitution claims against HMRC.
HMRC held back 261 million from the second payment contending that it represents the new 45% tax on that payment, leading to total cash received by the Group of 963 million.
Actions challenging the legality of the 45% tax have been lodged by both the Group and other participants in the FII GLO.
Due to the uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome the Group has not recognised any impact in the Group Income Statement in the current or prior period.
The receipt, net of the deduction by HMRC, is held as deferred income as disclosed in note 23.
Any future recognition as income will be treated as an adjusting item, due to the size of the order, with interest accruing on the balance 8 million in 2015 also treated as an adjusting item.

The Groups share of the gain on the divestiture of intangibles and other assets by RAI to ITG Brands LLC, a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, is 371 million.
Given that the profit on this item is recognised as an adjusting item by the Group, the additional deferred tax charge of 22 million on the potential distribution of these undistributed earnings has also been treated as adjusting.
e Tax on adjusting items In addition, the tax on adjusting items, separated between the different categories, as per note 7, amounted to 80 million 2014: 69 million.
As described in note 4 b the Groups investment of US$4.7 billion in cash in RAI has realised a deemed gain of US$931 million 601 million.
This gain is reflected as a permanent difference in note 6 c. The adjustment to the adjusted earnings per share see note 7 also includes 3 million 2014: 5 million in respect of the non-controlling interests share of the adjusting items net of tax.
