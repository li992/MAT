Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 12 Retirement benefit schemes The Groups subsidiary undertakings operate around 170 retirement benefit arrangements worldwide.
The majority of scheme members belong to defined benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally and many of which are closed to new entrants.
The Group also operates anumber of defined contribution schemes.
The liabilities arising in the defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
All schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The principal schemes are in the UK, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Together schemes in these territories account for over 85% of the total obligations of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
These obligations consist mainly of final salary pension schemes which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
As a result of regulatory changes, with effect from 1 January 2015, theschemes in the Netherlands now accrue benefits based on lifetime average salaries.
In addition, the Group operates several healthcare benefit schemes, of which the most significant are in Canada.
The liabilities in respect of healthcare benefits are also assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit credit method.
All of these arrangements, including funded schemes where formal trusts or equivalents are required, have been developed and are operated in accordance with local practices and regulations where applicable in the countries concerned.
For example, in the UK, the main pension scheme is the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund, which is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with the Pension Scheme Act 1993, Pensions Act 1995, Pension Act 2004 and all the relevant legislation.
Responsibility for the governance of the schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with the trustees.
The trustees for each arrangement will usually consist of representatives appointed by both the sponsoring company and the beneficiaries.
The majority of schemes are subject to local regulation regarding funding deficits.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded schemes and after taking into account regulatory requirements.
Contributions to the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund have been agreed with the Trustee as part of a recovery plan to include 30 million a year to cover ongoing service costs and additional contributions to eliminate a funding shortfall.
Additional contributions were 148 million in 2015 and 140 million in 2014 and are planned to be 78 million in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018.
These contributions will be used to achieve the statutory funding objective and thereafter to support attaining a lower risk investment strategy noted below and may be subject to renegotiation, dependent on funding levels.
Total contributions payable are secured by a charge over the Groups Head Office Globe House up to a maximum of 150 million.
The charge would be triggered in the event that the Group defaults on agreed contributions due to the Fund or if an insolvency event occurs with respect to the UK entity responsible for making the payments.
The charge is due to be released in 2039 but may be released earlier by negotiation or if the assets of the Fund are sufficient to achieve certain funding levels.
Under the rules of the scheme, any future surplus would be returnable to the Group by refund at the end of the life of the scheme.
The funding commitment is therefore not considered onerous and in accordance with IFRIC 14 no additional liabilities have been recognised in respect of this commitment.
Payments made to pensioners by the operating companies in Germany, net of income on scheme assets, are deemed to be company contributions to the Contractual Trust Arrangements and are anticipated to be around 33 million in 2016 and then 31 million per annum for the next following four years.
Contributions to pension schemes in Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland in total are anticipated to be around 19 million in 2016 and then 11 million per annum for the next following four years.
Group contributions to pension schemes in 2016 are expected to be 173 million in total compared to 262 million in 2015.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds: however, there are also a number of unfunded schemes where the sponsoring company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.
For unfunded schemes in the UK and Canada, 33% of the liabilities reported at year-end are expected to be settled by the Group within 10 years, 28% between 10 and 20 years, 20% between 20 and 30 years, and 19% thereafter.
The funded arrangements in the Group have policies on investment management, including strategies over a preferred long-term investment profile, and schemes in certain territories including Canada and the Netherlands manage their bond portfolios to match the weighted average duration of scheme liabilities.
In addition, the main scheme in the UK has a target investment strategy such that, by 31 December 2018, the scheme will have moved to 20% return-seeking assets and 80% risk-reducing assets.
Investments are diversified by type of investment, by investment sector, and where appropriate by country.
154 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 12 Retirement benefit schemes continued Through its defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, including: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set by reference to bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield e. g. due to stock market volatility, this will create a deficit.
However, most schemes hold a proportion of assets which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, and the majority of schemes by value are subject to local regulation regarding funding deficits.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings or other hedging instruments.
Inflation risk Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place in the scheme rules, while some assets and derivatives provide specific inflation protection.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Assumptions regarding mortality and mortality improvements are regularly reviewed in line with actuarial tables and scheme specific experience.

In addition certain scheme assets, including a portion of the assets held in the main UK pension scheme, are further diversified by investing in equities listed on foreign stock exchanges via investment funds.
In the above analysis investments via equity-based investment funds are shown under listed equities, and investments via bond-based investment funds are shown under listed bonds.
In Jamaica, a pension scheme holds shares in Carreras Limited a Group subsidiary with a fair value of 1 million 2014: 1 million.
The shares are listed on the Jamaica stock exchange.
Other assets include cash and other deposits, derivatives and other hedges including liability driven investments funds and inflation opportunity funds, recoverable taxes, reinsurance contracts, infrastructure investments and investment property.
The actuarial gains and losses in both years principally relate to movements in the fair values of scheme assets and actual returns are stated net of applicable taxes and fund management fees.

Mortality assumptions are subject to regular review.
The principal schemes used the following tables for both years: UK 91.5% S1NA year of birth table with the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2013 model with a 1.75% long-term improvement rate Germany Heubeck tables 2005G Canada CPM-2014 Private Table Netherlands AG Prognosetafel 2014 Switzerland LPP 2010 tables Based on the above, the weighted average life expectancy, in years, for mortality tables used to determine benefit obligations is as follows: UK Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 31 December 2015 Member age 65 current life expectancy 23.7 26.3 19.0 23.1 21.2 23.7 20.9 24.8 21.5 24.0 Member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 26.4 29.1 21.7 25.6 22.3 24.7 23.4 26.8 23.3 25.7 31 December 2014 Member age 65 current life expectancy 23.6 26.1 18.9 23.0 20.8 23.3 20.8 24.7 21.4 23.9 Member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 26.3 28.9 21.6 25.5 22.0 24.3 23.3 26.7 23.2 25.6 Valuation of retirement benefit schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2015 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation, while asset values also change, and the impacts may offset to some extent.
