The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacturing at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, have the potential to produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.
The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is highly regulated and the operations of market participants, such as Hikma, are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the FDA and the US Department of Justice.
As a result, the Group is subject to certain investigations by governmental agencies, as well as other various legal proceedings considered typical to its business relating to employment, product liability and commercial disputes.
