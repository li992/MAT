These items are not part of the Groups normal ongoing operations.

This spend is included in the estimated integration costs of $33m announced on completion of the acquisition, which will be completed over the next 18 months.
Acquisition costs of 0.6m have been expensed as exceptional items relating to the acquisition of Advanstar and a further 0.6m expensed in relation to other acquisitions.
These relate mainly to due diligence and professional fees paid to various advisors.
An exceptional charge of 0.2m was recognised relating to revised contingent consideration estimates for prior year acquisitions.
106 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 3.5 Exceptional operating items continued Exceptional items in joint ventures and associates A dividend of 2.1m was received during the year from a joint venture which was previously impaired to nil.

The Group has recognised a re-measurement loss of 6.2m on its initial 40% shareholding of eMedia Asia Limited during the year offset by 2.0m reclassification adjustment of foreign exchange previously recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Group acquired the remaining 60% on 30 June 2015 and used the purchase price as an estimate for the fair value of the initial shareholding.
The taxation effect of the exceptional items reported above on the amounts charged to the income statement is nil.
3.6 Tax This note details the accounting policies applied for tax, the current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year, a reconciliation of total tax expense to the accounting profit and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policy Current tax for the current and prior periods is recognised, to the extent unpaid, as a liability at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax liabilities are measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Current tax expense and deferred tax expense are recognised in the income statement except to the extent they arise from a transaction or event recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any such tax expense is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.
The Group is a multi-national group with tax liabilities arising in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to complexity in the Groups tax structure.
Therefore the calculation of the Groups current tax liabilities and tax expense necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
The tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements are measured at the Directors estimate of tax that may become payable.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period identified.
Income statement Restated 2015 2014 Continuing m m Current tax expense 40.5 17.7 Exceptional deferred tax charge credit 4.0 29.9 Other deferred tax credit 17.2 5.5 Income tax expense credit 27.3 17.7 In 2014, as a consequence of the acquisition of Advanstar, deferred tax assets in certain US companies that had previously not been recognised were recognised.
An exceptional tax credit of 29.9m was therefore taken through the income statement.
4.0m of the asset was released as an exceptional deferred tax charge in the current period.

These have been recognised because the Group expects to generate taxable profits against which these will be used in the next 12 months.
The Group has the following unused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised: 297.8m 2014: 255.6m in UK subsidiaries which are available to offset against future UK corporate tax liabilities: 201.6m 2014: 209.7m in US subsidiaries which are available to offset against future US federal tax liabilities.
Of these 192.7m expire between 2019 and 2035 2014: 209.0m between 2019 and 2034 : 254.5m 2014: 232.1m of UK capital losses which are only available for offset against future capital gains: 6.2bn 2014: 6.7bn that have arisen in Luxembourg holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes: and 4.0m 2014: 3.7m in respect of companies in other countries.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of any of these amounts as it is uncertain that these losses will be utilised.
In addition the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in relation to other deductible temporary differences of 19.0m 7.1m in relation to the UK, 10.1m in relation to the US, and 1.8m in relation to other countries 2014: 15.0m 12.5m, nil and 2.5m respectively.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect these assets as it is uncertain that they will be utilised.
At 31 December 2015, net deferred tax liabilities of 1.1m 2014: 1.1m have been recognised for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries.
No other deferred tax liabilities have been recognised as the Group has determined that profits of subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 4.7bn 2014: 4.2bn.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2015 109 Financial Statements Section 3: Operating profit and tax continued 3.7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share excludes amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, deferred tax on amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and net financing expense adjustments detailed in Note 5.4.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2015 would be to increase weighted average shares by 3.0 million shares 2014: 3.1 million shares.
The weighted average number of shares excludes Ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan the ESOP.
