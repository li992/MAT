01 Strategic report 02 Corporate governance 03 Financial statements 04 Other information SECTION 3: ASSET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group Accounting policies Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Groups share of total gains and losses on joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan.
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control: a significant degree of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.
USAF and LSAV are jointly owned entities that are accounted for as joint ventures.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements and Unites role as manager of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of joint control following changes to accounting standards IFRS10 involves judgements around a number of significant factors.
These factors include how Unite as fund manager has the ability to direct relevant activities such as acquisitions, disposals, capital expenditure for refurbishments and funding whether through debt or equity.
This assessment for USAF is complex because of the number of unit holders and how their rights are represented through an Advisory Committee.
For some of the activities it is not clear who has definitive control of the activities, in some scenarios the Group can control, in others the Advisory Committee.
However, for the activities which are considered to have the greatest impact on the returns of USAF, acquisitions and equity financing, it has been determined that the Group and the Advisory Committee has joint power in directing these activities and that on balance, it is appropriate to account for USAF as a joint venture.
The assessment for LSAV is more straightforward because the Group and GIC each own 50% of the joint venture and there is therefore much clearer evidence that control over the key activities is shared by the two parties.
The Group has two joint ventures: Groups share of assets results Legal entity in which Joint venture 2015 2014 Objective Partner Group has interest The UNITE UK Student 23.0% 24.0% Invest in and operate Consortium of investors UNITE Student Accommodation Fund student accommodation Accommodation Fund, USAF throughout the UK a Jersey Unit Trust London Student 50% 50% Develop and operate GIC Real Estate Pte, Ltd LSAV Unit Trust a Jersey Accommodation student accommodation Unit Trust and LSAV Real estate Venture LSAV in London Holdings Ltd investment vehicle incorporated in Jersey of the Government of Singapore Part of the Groups interest is held through a subsidiary, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd, in which there is an external investor.
A minority interest therefore occurs on consolidation of the Groups results representing the external investors share of profits and assets relating to its investment in USAF.
The ordinary shareholders of The UNITE Group plc are beneficially interested in 21.4% 2014: 22.0% of USAF.

These were primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties.
As a result of being provided interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Groups finance income.
c Transactions with joint ventures The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
In addition, the Group is entitled to performance fees from USAF and LSAV if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks.
The Group receives an enhanced equity interest in the JVs as consideration for the performance fee.
The Group has recognised the following fees in its results for the year.
2015 2014 m m USAF 8.5 6.9 LSAV 4.7 3.4 OCB 0.3 Asset and property management fees 13.2 10.6 LSAV 1.4 2.7 Development management fees 1.4 2.7 USAF performance fee 25.6 USAF acquisition fee 2.1 1.4 Investment management fees 27.7 1.4 Total fees 42.3 14.7 Included in the movement in EPRA NAV in a USAF performance fee of 20.2 million 2014: nil.

The USAF performance fee will be settled in units in The Unite UK Student Accommodation Fund rather than cash.

Included in share of joint venture profit in the income statement is a share of joint venture property management fee costs of 1.4 million 2014: 0.8 million.

Development management fees are included in the Property Segment result note 2.2a.
Investment management fees are included within the unallocated to segments note 2.2a.
