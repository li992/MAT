These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, and arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
The largest customer accounts for less than 5% of revenue and the 10 largest customers account for less than 30% of revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty and the maximum duration of a deposit.
The trade receivables as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.

Credit to customers is provided in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance generally being due to concerns regarding a customers solvency or the age of a receivable.
In most situations where a receivable is aged but no specific allowance has been made for it, no revenue has been taken and it forms part of the deferred revenue balance.
Collateral is not required in respect of financial assets.
