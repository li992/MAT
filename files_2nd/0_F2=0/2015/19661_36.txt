Adjusted performance measures Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS, as management believe these measures enable them to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items which management have defined as amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration fair value adjustments, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses, unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments, gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances, unwinding of the discount factor on deferred and contingent consideration, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate see Note 8.
