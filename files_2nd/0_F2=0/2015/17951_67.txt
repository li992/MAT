Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 16 Derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivatives are determined based on market data primarily yield curves, implied volatilities and exchange rates to calculate the present value of all estimated flows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date.
In the absence of sufficient market data, fair values would be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives.
The classification of these derivative assets and liabilities under the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy is given in note 24.

The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All derivatives are undertaken for risk management purposes.
For cash flow hedges, the timing of expected cash flows is as follows: 2015 2014 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Within one year 73 65 150 38 Between one and two years 4 5 17 5 Between two and three years 2 Beyond five years 9 86 70 169 43 The Groups cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments.
The timing of expected cash flows in respect of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is broadly expected to be comparable to the time periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
