The segment results include an allocation of head office expenses.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments: Materials Analysis provides products and services that enable customers to determine structure, composition, quantity and quality of particles and materials during their research and product development processes, when assessing materials before production, or during the manufacturing process.
The operating companies in this segment are Malvern Instruments, PANalytical and Particle Measuring Systems.
Test and Measurement supplies test, measurement and analysis equipment, software and services for product design optimisation, manufacturing control, microseismic monitoring and environmental noise monitoring.
The operating companies in this segment are Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration, ESG Solutions and HBM.
In-line Instrumentation provides process analytical measurement, asset monitoring and on-line controls as well as associated consumables and services for both primary processing and the converting industries.
The operating companies in this segment are Brel & Kjr Vibro, BTG, NDC Technologies and Servomex.
Industrial Controls provides products and solutions that measure, monitor, control, inform, track and trace during the production process.
The operating companies in this segment are Microscan, Omega Engineering and Red Lion Controls.
