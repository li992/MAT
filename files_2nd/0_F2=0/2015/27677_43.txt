AOP is a measure of profitability which adjusts the IFRS profit measures for the specific items detailed in note C1 and, as such, it is a non-IFRS measure.
The reconciliation set out above explains the differences between AOP and profit after tax as reported under IFRS.
For core life assurance and property & casualty businesses, AOP is based on a long-term investment return, including returns on investments held by life funds in Group equity and debt instruments, and is stated net of income tax attributable to policyholder returns.
For all core businesses, AOP excludes goodwill impairment, the impact of accounting for intangibles acquired in a business combination, the costs related to completed acquisitions, revaluations of put options related to long-term incentive schemes, profit loss on acquisition disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments, fair value profits losses on certain Group debt instruments, cost of hedging equity instruments and costs related to the development of the new Old Mutual Wealth platform capability and outsourcing of UK business administration.
AOP includes dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities.
Old Mutual Bermuda is treated as a non-core operation in the AOP disclosure and is therefore not included in AOP.
Refer to note B1 for further information on the basis of segmentation.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as AOP.
It is stated after tax and non-controlling interests attributable to AOP.
It excludes income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.
