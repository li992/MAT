The cost of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of equity instruments on the date they are granted and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to Retained earnings.
For cash-settled share-based payment arrangements, the services acquired and liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised as the employees render service.
Until settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Fair value is determined by using appropriate valuation models.
Vesting conditions include service conditions and performance conditions: any other features of the arrangement are non-vesting conditions.
Market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the award at the date of grant.
Vesting conditions other than market performance conditions are not taken into account in the initial estimate of the fair value at the grant date.
They are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction.
A cancellation that occurs during the vesting period is treated as an acceleration of vesting and is recognised immediately for the amount that would otherwise have been recognised for services over the vesting period.
Where HSBC Holdings enters into share-based payment arrangements involving employees of subsidiaries for which the subsidiaries are recharged, the difference between the cost of the share-based payment arrangement and the fair value of the equity instruments expected to be issued to satisfy those arrangements is recognised as an adjustment to Investment in subsidiaries over the vesting period.

Post-employment benefit plans Accounting policy HSBC operates a number of pension and other post-employment benefit plans throughout the world.
These plans include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans and various other post-employment benefits such as post-employment healthcare.
Payments to defined contribution plans and state-managed retirement benefit plans, where HSBCs obligations under the plans are equivalent to a defined contribution plan, are charged as an expense as the employees render service.
The defined benefit pension costs and the present value of defined benefit obligations are calculated at the reporting date by the schemes actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The net charge to the income statement mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability and is presented in operating expenses.
The past service cost, which is charged immediately to the income statement, is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods resulting from a plan amendment the introduction or withdrawal of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan or curtailment a significant reduction by the entity in the number of employees covered by a plan.
A settlement is a transaction that eliminates all further legal and constructive obligations for part or all of the benefits provided under a defined benefit plan, other than a payment of benefits to, or on behalf of, employees that is set out in the terms of the plan and included in the actuarial assumptions.
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 364 Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.
The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The cost of obligations arising from other post-employment defined benefit plans, such as defined benefit health-care plans, are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension plans.
The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world.
Some are defined benefit plans, of which the largest is the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme the principal plan.
The Pension Risk section on page 189 and the Appendix to Risk on page 225 contain details about the characteristics, risks and amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows and policies and practices associated with the principal plan.
