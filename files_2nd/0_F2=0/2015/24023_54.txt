Going Concern The Companys investment objective, strategy and policy are subject to a process of regular Board monitoring and are designed to ensure that the Company is invested mainly in readily realisable, listed securities and that the level of borrowings is restricted.
The Company retains title to all assets held by the Custodian and agreements cover its borrowing facilities.
Cash is held with banks approved and regularly reviewed by the Manager and the Board.
The Directors believe that: the Companys objective and policy continue to be relevant to investors: the Company operates within a robust regulatory environment: and the Company has sufficient resources to continue operating within its stated policy for the 12 month period commencing from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been drawn up on the basis that the Company is a going concern.
Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of publicly listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and Private Equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value except as noted in d below and in note 16 in respect of the perpetual debenture stock.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities, including any derivatives, held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Boards policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective include: risk diversification no more than 5% of the portfolio may be invested in unquoted securities, excluding Private Equity investments, and no single investment may be made which exceeds 10% of the value of the portfolio at the time of acquisition: currency borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies: and gearing borrowings including the debenture valued at market value should not normally exceed 20% of shareholders funds.
The total nominal exposure arising from derivative holdings is limited to a maximum of 5% of the portfolio at the time of investment.
There were no derivative positions held or outstanding at year end.
The Board meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
Debenture deeds and loan contracts are agreed and signed by the Board and compliance with the agreements is monitored by the Board at each meeting.
Gearing may be short or long-term in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.

Interest rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 December is shown below: 2015 2014 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates Cash and deposits 8,322 8,322 8,921 8,921 Borrowings Overdrafts Exposure to fixed rates Cash and deposits 65,283 65,283 23,910 23,910 Debentures 575 575 575 575 Other borrowings 154,096 144,568 298,664 173,405 86,611 260,016 Net exposures At year end 80,491 145,143 225,634 140,574 87,186 227,760 Maximum in year 176,963 145,143 322,106 140,574 88,631 229,205 Minimum in year 80,491 85,739 166,230 78,036 85,466 163,502 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rate applying on the debenture stock is set out in note 16 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the debenture on which the interest rate is fixed.
The debenture is valued in the accounts at par value.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 74 74 || For Foreign & Colonial Investment T eign & Colonial Investment T rust PLC rust PLC OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT AUDITORS REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT NOTICE OF MEETING INFORMATION FINANCIAL REPORT 25.

The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in the Fund Managers Review.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV: 2015 2014 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 586,514 586,514 561,073 561,073 NAV per share pence 104.93 104.93 99.78 99.78 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments, Private Equity investments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio over 500 at 31 December 2015 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio and the existence of ongoing overdraft and loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 350 million as set out in notes 13 and 15 on the accounts.
The facilities limit the amount which the Company may borrow at any one time as a proportion of the relevant portfolio of investments and cash.
The most onerous financial covenant limits total borrowings to 33.3% of the Companys adjusted net asset value, which at 31 December 2015 was 2,425 million.
Actual borrowings at market value at 31 December 2014 were 298.7 million in loans see notes 13 and 15 and 0.4 million in a debenture at market value see note 16.
At 31 December 2015 the Company had 43.2 million outstanding commitments to Private Equity investments, payable over more than one year see note 22 b.

Financial Risk Management continued The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2015 000s 000s 000s 000s Current liabilities Overdrafts Other borrowings 154,096 154,096 Other creditors 10,818 10,818 Long-term liabilities 161,787 161,787 164,914 161,787 326,701 More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2014 000s 000s 000s 000s Current liabilities Overdrafts Other borrowings 173,405 173,405 Other creditors 4,585 4,585 Long-term liabilities 87,210 87,210 177,990 87,210 265,224 c Credit risk and counterparty exposure The Company is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Company has paid, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
The Board approves all counterparties used in such transactions, which must be settled on the basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
A list of pre-approved counterparties is maintained by the Manager and regularly reviewed by the Board.
Broker counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Payments in respect of Private Equity investments are made only to counterparties with whom a contracted commitment exists.
Cash and deposits are held with approved banks.
The Company has an ongoing contract with its Custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract was reviewed and updated in 2014.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
The Companys depositary, JPMorgan Europe Limited JPMEL, has regulatory responsibilities relating to segregation and safe keeping of the Companys financial assets, amongst other duties, as set out in the Directors Report.
The Board has direct access to JPMEL and receives regular reports from it via the Manager.

Financial Risk Management continued To the extent that the Manager carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk continuously through regular meetings with the management of F&C including the Fund Manager and with the F&Cs Risk Management function.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews F&Cs annual Audit and Assurance Faculty Report.
The Company had no credit-rated bonds or similar securities in its portfolio at the year end 2014: none and does not normally invest in them.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due date or impaired.
In summary, compared to the amounts included in the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: 2015 2014 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum sheet date exposure sheet date exposure Current liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s Derivative financial instruments 9,250 d Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The assets and liabilities of the Company are, in the opinion of the Directors, reflected in the balance sheet at fair value, or at a reasonable approximation thereof, except for the debentures which are carried at par value in accordance with Accounting Standards.
The fair value of the debentures, derived from their quoted market price at 31 December 2015, was 429,000 2014: 429,000.
Borrowings under overdraft and loan facilities do not have a value materially different from their capital repayment amount.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at exchange rates ruling at each valuation date.
The fair value of investments quoted on active markets is determined directly by reference to published price quotations in these markets.
Unquoted investments, including Private Equity investments, are valued based on professional advice and assumptions that are not wholly supported by prices from current market transactions or by observable market data.
The Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments.
With respect specifically to investments in Private Equity funds or partnerships, the underlying managers provide regular estimated valuations to the Directors, based on the latest information available to the managers and not necessarily co-terminous with the reporting dates of the Company.
The Directors review the valuations for consistency with the Companys accounting policies and with fair value principles.
The estimated valuations relating to the Private Equity funds period ends are compared annually by the Directors to the final audited annual valuations of those funds to ensure that the managers valuation techniques gave rise to valid estimates.
The Directors were satisfied with the results of this annual review, which took place most recently in June 2015, indicating that the Company can, all things being equal, continue to place reliance on the managers estimates and valuation techniques.
e Capital risk management The objective of the Company is stated as being to provide shareholders with long-term growth in capital and income.
In pursuing this longterm objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an optimal capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buy back share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general meeting: borrow monies in the short and long terms: and pay dividends to shareholders out of current year revenue earnings as well as out of brought forward revenue and capital reserves.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 17 on the accounts.
Dividend payments are set out in note 9 on the accounts.
The Directors have no current intention to pay dividends out of capital reserves.
Borrowings are set out in notes 13, 15 and 16 on the accounts.
