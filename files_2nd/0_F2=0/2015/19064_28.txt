Exceptional items French Profit Share In October 2013, Page Personnel France PPF received notice from the Competent Authorities of the UK and France of their decision regarding a transfer pricing case that had arisen as a result of a tax audit in March 2008.
The decision, which was unexpected, increased the profit generated by PPF, which, as per the mandatory profit share or participation aux rsultats fide lentreprise that is particular to France, drove a requirement to pay increased employee profit share, both to employees of PPF and also to the temporary workers placed by that company.
As a result, the Group took in 2013 an exceptional charge of 2.5m relating to prior periods, and 0.6m that was included within operating profits from trading activities.
In December 2014, PPF received notice from the French tax authorities that they would not be seeking to make any further transfer pricing adjustments as a result of their audit of the tax years 2011 and 2012.
In addition, as no assessment was raised within the statutory timeframe, there would be no adjustment for the 2010 tax year.
Accordingly, in 2014, the Group recorded 1.6m relating to the reversal of amounts that were previously provided as an exceptional charge and a further 0.6m that was included within operating profit.
There was also a release of 0.3m of exceptional interest and 0.8m of income tax relating to this exceptional item.
There are no exceptional items in the current year.

The Group maintains a provision in relation to disputes and uncertain tax positions, including transfer pricing, which is included in the current tax liability.
the Group has considered if there is a need to make a disclosure in relation to IAS 1 estimation uncertainty and have concluded that as no material adjustment to the carrying value of the transfer pricing reserve at 31 December 2015 is anticipated within the next financial year, no disclosure is required.

The comparative final dividend at 31 December 2014 was also not recognised as a liability in the prior year.
The proposed final dividend of 7.90p 2014: 7.58p per Ordinary share will be paid on 20 June 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 20 May 2016, subject to approval by shareholders.
When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.
Earnings per Ordinary share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: 2015 2014 000 000 Earnings Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 66,208 59,331 Exceptional items 000 Note 5 2,762 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share before exceptional items 000 66,208 56,569 Number of shares number number Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 311,436 308,020 Dilutive effect of share plans 000 2,368 2,303 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 313,804 310,323 pence pence Basic earnings per share 21.3 19.3 Diluted earnings per share 21.1 19.1 Basic earnings per share before exceptional items 21.3 18.4 Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items 21.1 18.2 The above results relate to continuing operations.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding Ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust and held in the reserve.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.
A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2015 2014 000 000 UK 1,274 1,274 USA 214 214 Singapore 51 51 1,539 1,539 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget, management projections for five years, followed by an assumed growth rate of 3%, which does not exceed the longterm average growth rate of the relevant markets and reflects long-term wage inflation fee growth.
Management applied a discount rate of 8%, representing the weighted average cost of capital for the Group, to the estimated future cash flows to calculate the terminal value of those cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill allocated to any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax assets liabilities recognised by the Group, and the movements thereon, during the current and prior reporting periods.
Share-based payments Tax losses Other Total 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 2015 2,468 4,481 2,086 9,035 Recognised in equity for the year 512 512 Recognised in profit or loss for the year 410 509 3,228 3,327 Exchange differences 14 14 At 31 December 2015 2,570 4,990 5,328 12,888 At 1 January 2014 3,078 3,317 3,091 9,486 Recognised in equity for the year 611 611 Recognised in profit or loss for the year 1 1,164 854 311 Exchange differences 151 151 At 31 December 2014 2,468 4,481 2,086 9,035 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2015 2014 000 000 Deferred tax assets 14,055 11,644 Deferred tax liabilities 1,167 2,609 12,888 9,035 No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 87.9m 2014: 88.9m of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The movement in the deferred tax balance in the year includes the effect of further recognition of tax losses in the US of 1.1m offset by the derecognition of losses in Taiwan and the utilisation of losses in other territories.
The movement in Other comprised of temporary differences between the recognition of income and expenditure for accounting and tax purposes.
This can vary from year to year and in 2015 resulted in an increase in the deferred tax asset of 3.2m 2014: 0.9m decrease.
The realisation of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable profits in the overseas territories in which the deferred tax has arisen.
Of the net deferred tax asset recognised, no amount relates to territories that were loss making in the current year.
In addition there are carried forward losses of 12.1m arising in overseas territories for which no deferred tax is recognised given the future utilisation of the tax losses is uncertain: there were no other tax attributes recognised in those territories.
These tax losses and other tax attributes remain available to offset future taxable profits in the respective territories where they have arisen.
The Group has estimated the likely value of deferred tax assets in respect of trading losses carried forward and all other categories.
The Group has considered if there is a need to make a disclosure in relation to IAS 1 estimation uncertainty and have concluded that as no material adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset at 31 December 2015 is anticipated within the next financial year, no disclosure is required.
Called-up share capital 2015 2014 Number of Number of 000 shares 000 shares Allotted, called-up and fully paid ordinary shares of 1p each At 1 January 3,219 321,834,542 3,208 320,826,167 Shares issued 39 4,085,163 11 1,008,375 At 31 December 3,258 325,919,705 3,219 321,834,542 Shares issued in the year related to the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Share Option Plans The Group has share option awards currently outstanding under an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and a Share Option Scheme SOS.
These plans are described below.
At 31 December 2015 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the Companys Ordinary shares of 1p under both the Michael Page Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Option Scheme.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
5,438,436 options were exercisable at the end of 2015 at a weighted average exercise price of 3.83 2014: 3.53.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 5.16.
Note 1 Executive Share Option Scheme Using the ESOS, awards of share options can be made to key management personnel and senior employees to receive shares in the Company.
No awards have been made under the ESOS since 2010 and this award has fully vested.
For grants under the ESOS, the performance condition is tested on the third anniversary and no retesting will occur thereafter.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index.
The respective base earnings per share for each grant are shown in the table above.
114 PB ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Note 2 Share Option Scheme Executive Directors of the Company are not eligible to participate in this plan.
Any exercises of awards made under this plan are settled by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.
This new scheme was created in 2009 to provide an effective plan under which to grant awards from 2009 onwards.
It was the Boards view that grants made under the existing ESOS, which would have required an increase over the 2008 base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index by 2011, would not be achievable due to the impact of the global downturn on the Groups EPS and thus would not provide the required retention incentive.
The 2009 grant made under the SOS plan is subject to a performance condition that was tested, initially, three years after the date of grant and since then has been and will be tested annually until either the entire grant vests, or ten years from the date of grant of the award have elapsed, in which case any awards outstanding under the grant will lapse.
The performance condition is directly linked to the Groups Operating Profit.
If Operating Profit is 30m then 30% of the award would vest.
For every 1m of Operating Profit over 30m, a further 1% would vest.
100% of the award would vest if Operating Profit was 100m.
As the Groups 2011 Operating Profit was 86.0m, 86% of this award vested on 10 March 2012.
The remaining 14% has been retested in each subsequent year.
No additional options vested other than in 2015, when an additional 4% vested.
Further grants under the SOS plan were made in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
The performance conditions for these grants are also directly linked to the Groups Operating Profit.
For the 2011 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of 100m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional 1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of 200m or more.
None of this award has yet vested.
For the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 grants, if Operating Profit is in excess of 50m, a proportion of the award equivalent to the amount of Operating Profit achieved will vest up to a maximum of 100% if the Operating Profit is 100m or more.
Operating Profit of 90.1m has so far been achieved.
Other share-based payment plans The Company also operates a Management Incentive Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and a Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Senior Executives.
Details of these plans are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report and are settled by cash or the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
These plans are described as follows: LTIP MIP As at 1 Jan 2015 306,152 2,410,970 Granted 295,604 609,917 278,016 Lapsed Exercised 8,631 734,551 Outstanding as at 31 Dec 2015 593,125 2,008,320 Weighted average fair value at the date of measurement Share option valuation and measurement In 2015, options were granted on 20 March with the estimated fair value of the options granted on that day of 0.84.
In 2014, options were granted on 11 March.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on that date was 0.87.
Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions.
These conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2015 have an exercise price in the range of 187.5p to 526.0p and a weighted average contractual life of 6.5 years.
The fair values of options and other share awards granted during the year were calculated using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Long-Term Incentive Share Option Plans Plan Management Incentive Plan 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Share price 5.26 4.84 5.26 4.84 5.26 4.84 Nil Average exercise price 5.26 4.84 Nil Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 0.84 0.87 5.26 4.84 4.94-5.26 4.54 24% Expected volatility 23% 24% 23% 24% 23% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 0.71% 1.40% 0.71% 0.71% 0.83% Risk free rate 0.93% Expected dividend yield 2.09% 2.17% Nil Nil 2.09% 2.17% 115 PB ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price in the last 12 months.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Group recognised total expenses of 7.6m, including social security, 2014: 5.8m related to share-based payment transactions during the year.
Reserves Share premium The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of proceeds over the nominal value for all share issues, including the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.
Reserve for shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust At 31 December 2015, the reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust consisted of 14,776,231 Ordinary shares 2014: 17,458,124 Ordinary shares held for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the Management Incentive Share Plan, the Long Term Incentive Plan and the SOS, representing 4.5% of the called-up share capital with a market value of 71.6m 2014: 71.9m.
There are 12,663,133 of these shares held in the trust on which dividends are waived.
Currency translation reserve Since first-time adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards, the currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations that are integral to the operations of the Company.
Cash and cash equivalents Group Company 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 Cash at bank and in hand 76,957 84,941 Short-term deposits 18,061 5,071 Cash and cash equivalents 95,018 90,012 Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows 95,018 90,012 Net funds 95,018 90,012 The Group operates a multi-currency notional cash pool.
Currently the main Eurozone subsidiaries and the UK-based Group Treasury subsidiary participate in this cash pool, although it is the Groups intention to extend the scope of the participation to other Group companies going forward.
The structure facilitates interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: i credit risk ii liquidity risk iii market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
116 PB ANNUAL REPORT 2015 i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from clients.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Trade and other receivables Total trade receivables net of allowances held by the Group at 31 December 2015 amounted to 163.4m 2014: 156.1m.
An initial credit period is made available on invoices.
No interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice during this credit period.
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balance.
Trade receivables are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the provision of our services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 67.4m 2014: 64.3m that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The days sales of these receivables at the year end is 46 days in excess of the initial credit period 2014: 45 days.
The demographics of the Groups client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an influence on credit risk.
Less than 3% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single client.
The geographic diversification of the Groups revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring.
In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, ageing profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.
Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2015 2014 000 000 Balance at beginning of the year 5,818 6,658 Impairment losses recognised on receivables 7,167 7,230 Amounts written off as uncollectable 1,405 1,249 Amounts recovered during the year 2,579 2,550 Impairment losses reversed 3,366 4,271 Balance at end of the year 5,635 5,818 Most of the allowance for doubtful debts represents a provision for debts which the Group estimate may be irrecoverable, as well as individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 2.9m 2014: 3.2m which have been placed in litigation.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.
117 PB ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk for net trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2015 2014 000 000 EMEA 89,288 79,964 United Kingdom 40,147 37,323 Asia Pacific 20,545 23,287 Americas 13,397 15,486 163,377 156,060 The maximum exposure to credit risk for accrued income at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2015 2014 000 000 1,262 1,652 EMEA United Kingdom 16,502 13,885 Asia Pacific 13,138 12,296 Americas 6,845 5,656 37,747 33,489 The entire accrued income balance is not past due.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 14.
There is no material effect on pre-tax profit if the instruments are accounted for at fair value or amortised cost.
ii Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due.
It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings.
Cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
The Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities: Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2015 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 9,302 5,122 1,191 44 Accruals and other payables 42,032 21,603 17,721 Less than More than 12 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months months 2014 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 6,679 3,328 Accruals and other payables 40,682 20,969 21,356 118 PB ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Capital is equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders through share repurchases with subsequent cancellation, or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014. iii Market risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material.
However, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical fluctuations in Pounds Sterling against the Groups main exposure currencies is shown below.
There has been no material change in the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
Interest rate risk management Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group does not consider this risk as significant.
The benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The Groups only interest bearing assets and liabilities at 31 December 2015 relate to cash and bank overdrafts.
The average interest rate paid on bank overdrafts was 2.23% 2014: 2.22%.
Currency rate risk The Group publishes its results in Pounds Sterling and conducts its business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, the Group is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of its subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries.
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro, Chinese Renminbi Swiss Franc, Singapore Dollar and Australian Dollar.
The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations.
The Group policy is not to hedge translation exposure.
The Group has entered into hedges to cover its investments in foreign entities in the US and Canada designating them as net investment hedges.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge are transferred to other comprehensive income.
The pre-tax loss on effective hedging instruments deferred within other comprehensive income as at 31 December 2015 is 0.2m.
In certain cases, where the Company gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange rate derivatives to manage the currency exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the Groups policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.
Derivatives are disclosed within cash on the face of the balance sheet.
Fair values are not adjusted for credit risk, as required by IFRS 13, because credit impact is not material given the low fair value levels Derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives at fair value 2015 2014 m m Derivative Assets 0.3 0.3 Derivative Liabilities 0.8 0.5 Net Derivative Liabilities 0.5 0.2 Sensitivity analysis currency risk A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i. e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
