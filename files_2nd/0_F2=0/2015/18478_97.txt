Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 161 iii Other information on deferred tax assets and liabilities At the balance sheet date there were assets expected to reverse within the next year of US$186m 2014: US$200m.
As set out in note 5, there are a number of critical judgments in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets.
The Group has not recognised assets of US$132m 2014: US$124m in respect of losses that could be utilised against future taxable income and assets of US$10m 2014: US$12m in respect of capital losses that could be utilised against future taxable gains.
These losses have arisen in undertakings in which it is not currently anticipated that future benefit will be available from their use, but they are available indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date there were liabilities expected to reverse within the next year of US$48m 2014: US$44m.
There are retained earnings of US$12,619m 2014: US$12,020m in subsidiary undertakings which would be subject to tax if remitted to Experian plc.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on these because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Given the mix of countries and tax rates, it is not practicable to determine the impact of such remittance.
The main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 and deferred tax arising in the UK has therefore been provided at 20% 2014: 20%.
