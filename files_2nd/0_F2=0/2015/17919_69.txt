Strategic report Governance Financial statements 151 16 Derivative financial instruments continued During the year in accordance with group policy, the group entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars in the future at xed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
Cash ow hedges The derivative asset recognised on these 15 instruments is 38.9 million, of which the currency component is a gain of 14.5 million and a gain of 4.3 million taken to the hedging reserve.
The total exchange component of the cash ow hedge derivatives movement has been accounted for within the statement of comprehensive income 14.5 million gain.
The 4.3 million gain has been taken to the hedging reserve and will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the private placement.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the recognition of a derivative asset of 0.6 million 2014: derivative asset of 0.4 million.
During the year a gain of 0.2 million 2014: gain of 1.1 million was recognised in equity.
This equity transfer will then be recognised in the income statement in line with the hedged transaction.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31 December 2015 the xed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.45% and 5.57% on the xed European swaps.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The movement on the derivative asset arising has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 14.9 million gain.
The groups borrowings under its revolving credit facilities are designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31 December 2015 was 40.1 million 2014: 143.3 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 8.9 million on translation is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The further issue of US private placement notes in February 2015 for DKK654.8 million and 79.7 million are also designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31 December 2015 was 123.3 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 0.7 million on translation from inception is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
Fair value hedges The group had no fair value hedges in 2015.
17 Financial risk management 17.1 Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash ow interest rate risk and price risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Chief Financial Officer identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
The group policy is to enter forward contracts to purchase US dollars based upon the expected purchases.
These derivatives are classied ascash ow hedges.
Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2015 152 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2015 and 2014, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31 December 2015 Swedish Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 104.0 70.3 12.6 51.1 17.6 255.6 Bank overdrafts 125.0 2.0 1.9 128.9 Net cash and cash equivalents note13 21.0 68.3 12.6 51.1 15.7 126.7 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities note 15 23.1 64.6 310.0 58.7 40.1 496.5 Finance lease liabilities note 15 0.2 0.2 0.7 1.1 Pre-derivative net debt position 44.3 3.5 310.0 46.1 10.3 15.7 370.9 Derivative effect note 16 0.6 185.1 310.0 12.3 56.7 56.5 Post-derivative net debt position 43.7 181.6 58.4 46.4 15.7 314.4 As at 31 December 2014 Swedish Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 37.4 72.5 19.1 95.2 38.1 262.3 Bank overdrafts 120.4 43.6 1.4 165.4 Net cash and cash equivalents note13 83.0 28.9 19.1 95.2 36.7 96.9 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities note 15 25.5 11.8 295.5 53.1 79.8 465.7 Finance lease liabilities note 15 0.6 0.2 4.6 0.2 5.6 Pre-derivative net debt position 109.1 16.9 295.5 34.0 10.8 36.5 374.4 Derivative effect note 16 0.3 201.6 295.5 13.1 58.5 22.6 Post-derivative net debt position 108.8 184.7 47.1 47.7 36.5 351.8 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 16. ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities price risk.
The group may from time to time be exposed to changes in the price of cotton.
To mitigate against this risk the group may enter into forward contracts to buy cotton based textiles at a future date.
Such contracts are not recognised as derivative financial instruments as they are held with the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entitys expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.
iii Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at oating rates.
The groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at xed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2015 and 2014, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 153 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of xed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 88.1 2.5 In more than one year, but not more than two years 0.3 84.5 In more than two years but not more than five years 178.7 175.9 In more than five years 190.4 65.1 457.5 328.0 Floating interest rate borrowings 40.1 143.3 Total borrowings 497.6 471.3 During 2015 and 2014, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31 December 2015 As at 31 December 2014 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 126.7 126.7 96.9 96.9 Borrowings 457.5 40.1 497.6 328.0 143.3 471.3 Pre-derivative net debt position 457.5 86.6 370.9 328.0 46.4 374.4 Derivative effect note i 55.9 55.9 22.2 22.2 Post-derivative net debt position 401.6 86.6 315.0 305.8 46.4 352.2 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The majority of banks and financial institutions accepted are independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 325.0 million 2014: 266.6 million.
The group does not hold any collateral as security.
c Liquidity risk Cash ow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and is aggregated by group finance.
Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities note 15 at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the groups debt nancing plans, covenant compliance, and compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 155 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: a financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not inuence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: a the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net oating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: a the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: and a changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.
The following table shows the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, which is a result of increase decrease of 10% movement in foreign exchange gains losses on translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
The group continues to remain compliant with all its banking covenants.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.

The different levels have been dened as follows: a Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : a Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 2 : and a Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3.

The valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specic estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Specic techniques used to value financial instruments include: a quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments: a the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on observable yield curves: a the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value: and a other techniques, such as discounted cash ow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
