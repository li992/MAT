Resolution 2 To approve the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration This is an ordinary resolution, which is advisory only and seeks shareholder approval to the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration, excluding the Directors Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in December 2014.
Special Business Four resolutions will be proposed as special business at the forthcoming AGM.
The effect of these resolutions is as follows: Resolution 13 Authority to directors to issue shares This is an ordinary resolution which authorises the directors to allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 10,210,700, which is equivalent to approximately two-thirds of the Companys issued ordinary share capital, as at 12 October 2015, of which half being ordinary shares up to a nominal value of 5,105,350, representing approximately one-third of the Companys issued share capital, as at 12 October 2015, may only be allotted in connection with a rights issue.
Such authority, if granted, will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company.
As at 12 October 2015, the Company held no shares as treasury shares.
At present, the directors only intend to use this authority to satisfy the exercise of awards under the Companys share schemes.
The directors wish to obtain the necessary authority from shareholders so that allotments can be made if required and if suitable market conditions arise at short notice and without the need to convene a general meeting of the Company which would be both costly and time consuming.
Resolution 14 Disapplication of pre-emption rights This is a special resolution and is the customary annual request, in substitution for the authority granted to the directors by shareholders on 12 December 2014, which expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM, that shareholders empower the directors to allot ordinary shares for cash without first offering them pro-rata to existing shareholders, as would otherwise be required by section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 a in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offerand b otherwise than in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer up to an aggregate nominal value of 1,531,604, being approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 12 October 2015.
This disapplication authority is in line with institutional shareholder guidance and in particular with the Pre-Emption Groups Statement of Principles the Pre-emption Principles.
The Pre-emption Principles were revised in 2015 to allow the authority for an issue of shares for cash otherwise than in connection with a pre-emptive offer to be increased from 5% which is the limit in the directors existing authority to 10% of the Companys issued share capital, provided that the Company confirms that it intends to use the additional 5% authority only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.
The Board therefore confirms, in accordance with the Pre-emption Principles, that to the extent the authority in paragraph a ii of Resolution 14 is used for an issue of ordinary shares with a nominal value in excess of 765,803 being approximately 5% of the Companys issued share capital as at 12 October 2015, it intends that this will only be used in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment, which is announced contemporaneously with the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.
The renewed authority will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM.
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority in paragraph a ii of Resolution 14, but consider it prudent to obtain the flexibility that this authority provides.
In accordance with the Pre-emption Principles, the directors confirm their intention not to issue more than 7.5% of the Companys issued share capital for cash, on a non pre-emptive basis, in any rolling three-year period without prior consultation with shareholders, save for shares issued in respect of an acquisition or specified capital investment, as described above.
Resolution 15 Companys purchase of its own shares The Companys authority to purchase its own ordinary shares, given at the last AGM, expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
The directors propose, as a special resolution, that it should be renewed for a further year to expire on the date of the next AGM.
The directors will review opportunities to use this authority in light of stock market conditions and trading opportunities during the year.
The directors will only make purchases which will reduce the number of shares in issue after paying due attention to the effect on the financing of the Group, its assets and earnings per share for the remaining shareholders.
Any shares purchased under this authority may be cancelled in which case the number of shares in issue will be reduced accordingly or may be held in treasury.
At 12 October 2015 there were options outstanding over 554,902 ordinary shares, representing 0.45% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
If the authority given by this resolution were to be fully used, these would represent 0.50% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
There are no warrants outstanding.
Details of any substantial shareholders holding more than 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital are included in the Notifiable Shareholders interests table on page 61.
