3.1 Revenue Accounting policy Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
The Group reports revenue under three revenue categories and the basis of recognition for each category is described below: Category & Examples Accounting Treatment Recurring revenue is revenue earned from customers for the provision of a good or service, where Recurring revenue risks and rewards are transferred to the customer over the term of a contract, with the customer Subscription contracts being unable to continue to benefit from the full functionality of the good or service without Maintenance and support contracts ongoing payments.
Pay as you go contracts Subscription revenue is revenue earned from customers for the provision of a good or service, where the risk and rewards are transferred to the customer over the term of a contract.
In the event that the customer stops paying, they lose the legal right to use the software and the Company has the ability to restrict the use of the product or service.
Subscription revenue and maintenance and support revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract including non-specified upgrades, when included.
Revenue relating to future periods is classified as deferred income on the balance sheet to reflect the transfer of risk and reward.
Perpetual software licences and specified upgrades revenue is recognised when the significant Software and software-related services risks and rewards of ownership relating to the licence have been transferred and it is probable Perpetual software licences that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.

Payment processing services Processing revenue is recognised at the point that the service is rendered on a per Payroll processing services transaction basis.
When products are bundled together before being sold to the customer, it is necessary to apply the recognition criteria to the separately identifiable components of a single transaction in order to reflect the substance of the transaction.

To arrive at underlying results, certain adjustments are made for items that are individually important and which could, if included, distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Management apply judgement in determining which items should be excluded from underlying performance.
Recurring items These are items which occur regularly but which management judge to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group.
These items relate mainly, although not restricted to, fair value adjustments on financial instruments, and merger & acquisition M&A activity which by its nature is irregular in its impact and includes amortisation, and acquisition related costs.
These do not include operating or integration costs related to the acquisition.
Recurring items are adjusted each year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Non-recurring items These items are those items which are non-recurring nature and are identified by virtue of either their size or nature.
These items can include, but are not restricted to, gains and losses on the disposal of assets, impairment charges and reversals and restructuring.
These are items which management judge to be of a one-off nature or non-operational, which would distort a reader of the Companys accounts understanding of underlying business performance.

The current year fair value adjustment 2.2m relates to an accounting loss on fair valuation of the call option in relation to the possible acquisition of Mastermaq.

This transaction occurred in August 2014.
Further details can be found in note 13.4.

As above, further details can be found in note 13.4.
Non-recurring items As a result of the annual goodwill impairment review, an impairment of the goodwill held in the Brazilian business was recognised in 2015 and 2014.

Further details can be found in note 6.1.
The adjustment relating to litigation costs relates to the defence of the Archer Capital case, which was strongly rejected by management.
In 2015 the claim brought by Archer Capital was dismissed on all grounds.
