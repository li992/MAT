Financials and other information Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Directors review information on a regular basis that is analysed by geography.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the segmental information provided below uses this geographic analysis of results as it is the most closely aligned with IFRS reporting requirements.
The Group only operates in one service line, being that of an investment holding company.
Therefore, no segmental analysis by service line has been produced.
The Group is an investment holding company and does not consider itself to have any customers.
The Group generated 55% 2014: 61% of its investment income in the period from investments held in the UK and Ireland and 45% 2014: 39% of investment income from investments held in continental Europe.
During the year, the Group generated income from its investments in Elenia of 18.1 million 2014: 23.2 million, Eversholt Rail of 15.6 million 2014: 17.9 million and AWG of 8.0 million 2014: 15.6 million which represents 31% 2014: 33%, 27% 2014: 33% and 14% 2014: 22%, respectively of the total investment income.
There was no other income entitlement during the year or in the comparative year that represented more than 10% of portfolio income.
Given the nature of the Groups operations, the Group is not considered to be exposed to any operational seasonality or cyclicality that would impact the financial results of the Group during the period or the financial position of the Group at 31 March 2015.

7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest Level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted and in active markets Quoted equity investments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are Derivative financial instruments held at fair value observable in the market either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted investments and unlisted managed funds For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing the categorisation based on the lowest Level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole for each reporting period.
At 31 March 2015, the Group held the following classes of financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
For all other assets and liabilities their carrying value approximates to fair value.
During the year ended 31 March 2015, there were no transfers of financial instruments between Levels of the fair value hierarchy 2014: none.
There were no non-recurring fair value measurements.

The holding period of the investments in the portfolio is expected to be greater than one year.
Therefore investments are classified as non-current unless there is an agreement to dispose of the investment within one year and all relevant regulatory approvals have been received.
It is not possible to identify with certainty where any investments may be sold within one year.
Unquoted investments The Group invests in private companies which are not quoted on an active market.
These investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted investments can be found in the section called Portfolio valuation methodology.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets together where they will be managed and valued as a single investment, were invested at the same time and cannot be realised separately.
For the year to 31 March 2015, the fair value of unquoted investments was 1,205.7 million 2014: 980.4 million.
Individual portfolio asset valuations are shown within the Portfolio summary on page 22.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
During the year the primary methodology for valuing Eversholt Rail was changed from a discounted cash flow to a sales basis.
This followed the announcement on 20 January 2015 that the Company had agreed to sell Eversholt Rail.
For those assets that continue to be valued on a discounted cash flow basis, the valuations are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Other significant unobservable inputs include the long-term inflation rate assumption and interest rates assumption used to project the future cash flows.
A discussion of discount rates applied can be found on page 28.
Increasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 84.2 million 2014: 88.1 million.
Decreasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 101.6 million 2014: 106.0 million.
The majority of assets held within Level 3 have revenues that are linked, partially linked or in some way correlated to inflation.
The long-term inflation rate assumptions for the country of domicile of the investments in the portfolio range from 5.0% India to 2.0% Finland but with the majority at 2.5% UK.
Changing the inflation rate assumption may result in consequential changes to other assumptions used in the valuation of each asset.
The impact of increasing the inflation rate assumption by 1% for the next two years would increase the value of the portfolio by 17.0 million 2014: 18.2 million.
Decreasing the inflation rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% for the next two years would decrease the value of the portfolio by 16.4 million 2014: 18.4 million.
The valuations are sensitive to changes to interest rates, which may result from: i unhedged existing borrowings within portfolio companies: ii interest rates on uncommitted future borrowings assumed within the asset valuations: and iii cash deposits held by portfolio companies.
These comprise a wide range of interest rates from short-term deposit rates to longer-term borrowing rates across a broad range of debt products.
Increasing the cost of borrowing assumption for unhedged borrowings and any future uncommitted borrowing and the cash deposit rates used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 56.2 million 2014: 44.8m.
Decreasing the interest rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 52.7 million 2014: 43.1m.
This calculation does not take account of any offsetting variances which may be expected to prevail if interest rates changed, the most significant impact would be in the portfolio assets with regulated returns where the future allowed return may also be influenced by the interest rate.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2015 84 Financials and other information 7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments continued Unlisted managed funds The Company invests in one externally managed fund, The Dalmore Capital Fund, which is not quoted in an active market.
The Company considered the valuation techniques and inputs used in valuing this fund to ensure they are reasonable and appropriate and therefore the net asset value NAV of this fund may be used as an input into measuring its fair value.
In measuring this fair value, the NAV of the fund is adjusted, as necessary, to reflect restrictions on redemptions, future commitments, illiquid nature of the investments and other specific factors of the fund and fund manager.
The Company classifies the fair value of this investment as Level 3.
For the year to 31 March 2015, the fair value of unlisted managed funds was 17.4 million 2014: 15.6 million.
There are no adjustments currently made to the NAV of the fund 2014: none.
A 10% adjustment in the NAV of the fund would result in a 1.7 million 2014: 1.6 million change in the valuation.
Intermediate holding companies The Company invests in a number of intermediate holding companies that are used to hold the unquoted investments, valued as referred to above.
All other assets and liabilities of the intermediate holding companies are held either at fair value or a reasonable approximation to fair value.
The fair value of these intermediate holding companies therefore approximates to their NAV and the Company classifies the fair value as Level 3.
For the year to 31 March 2015, the fair value of the other assets and liabilities within these intermediate holding companies was 8.4 million 2014: 0.6 million.
Over-the-counter derivatives The Company holds its over-the-counter derivatives at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
This is discussed further in Note 10.
Valuation process for Level 3 valuations Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company.
The valuation of unquoted investments, debt, managed fund and derivative investments held by the Group is performed on a half-yearly basis by the valuation team of the Investment Adviser and reviewed by the Investment Committee of the Investment Adviser.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the valuation team.
The valuation team verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant documents and market information.
On a half-yearly basis, the Investment Adviser presents the valuation results to the Board.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments and investments with significant fair value changes.
The Investment Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs, and may request that alternative valuation methods are applied to support the valuation arising from the method chosen.
Any changes in valuation methods are discussed and agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee before being approved by the Board.

9 Financial risk management A full review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Key risks and mitigations section onpage 34.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Key risks and mitigations section where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specific financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards Investment Committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework of the Group.
The funding objective of the Group is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs are to be met ahead of planned investment.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2015 85 Financials and other information Notes to the accounts 9 Financial risk management continued Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowing facilities and shareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 11 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closed-ended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level of capital.
Capital is allocated for investment in utilities, transportation, primary PPP projects and low-risk energy projects across the UK, continental Europe and Asia.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is currently 20% of gross assets including cash holdings at the time of investment.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on 7 July 2015 the Board will ask shareholders approval for the limit to be increased to 25%.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of these financial assets.
Throughout the year and the prior year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties, principally in AAA-rated money market funds, as well as in shortterm bank deposits with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The counterparties selected for the derivative financial instruments were all banks with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The credit quality of loans and receivables and debt instruments within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed, or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the investment.
Fair value adjustments, or investment impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups investment.
In these cases an investment impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
As at 31 March 2015, the Group had no investments subject to impairment 2014: nil.
No other assets held by the Group were considered to be impaired.
The Company had no loans or receivables or debt investments considered past due 2014: nil.
The Company actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review of counterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2015, the Group did not consider itself to have a significant exposure to any one counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed by diversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.
The risk exposure at this year end is considered to be representative of the year as a whole.
Liquidity risk Further information on how liquidity risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The table below analyses the maturity of the Groups contractual liabilities.

All derivatives are settled net and therefore the liability shown is the net cash flow expected to be paid on settlement.
The financial commitment relates to the Companys commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund, RIVM, A12, La Sant, A9, Ayrshire College and Mersey Gateway Bridge PPP projects.
In order to manage the contractual liquidity risk the Company is not dependent on the cash flows from financial assets to manage contractual liquidity risk as it has free cash and debt facilities in place.
Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these fluctuations are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Key risks and mitigations section.
An increase or decrease of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2014: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate increase or decrease in net assets and to the net profit of the Group of 1.8 million 2014: 2.3 million.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest receivable on cash on deposit held at the year end.
The average cash balance of the Group during the year was 84.9 million 2014: 105.7 million and the weighted average interest earned was 0.4% 2014: 0.4%.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations as disclosed in Note 7.
This risk is considered a component of market price risk described in section iii.
The Group does not hold any fixed rate debt investments or borrowings and is therefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The currency denominations of the Groups net assets are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
As at 31 March 2015 Sterling Euro US dollar Total m m m m Net assets 880.7 374.0 66.6 1,321.3 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates: 1 Impact of exchange movements on net profit 36.4 34.0 6.1 3.7 1 Impact of exchange movements on net assets 36.4 34.0 6.1 3.7 1 Sterling impact relates to the impact of fair value movement in derivatives held by the Company to hedge foreign currency fluctuations in the valuation of the investment portfolio.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2015 87 Financials and other information Notes to the accounts 9 Financial risk management continued As at 31 March 2014 Sterling Euro US dollar Total m m m m Net assets 673.9 365.4 74.5 1,113.8 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates: Impact of exchange movements on net profit 33.0 33.2 6.8 7.0 Impact of exchange movements on net assets 33.0 33.2 6.8 7.0 The impact of an equivalent depreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates has the inverse impact on net profit and net assets from that shown above.
There is an indirect exposure to the rupee through the investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund which is denominated in US dollars but it is only the direct exposure that is considered here.
iii Market price risk Further information about the management of external market risk and its impact on market price or valuation, which arises principally from unquoted investments, is provided in the Key risks and mitigations section.
A 10% increase in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit and net assets.
As at 31 March As at 31 March 2015 2014 Investments Investments at fair value at fair value m m Increase in net profit 123.2 99.7 Increase in net assets 123.2 99.7 The impact of a 10% decrease in the fair value of those investments would have the inverse impact on net profit and net assets, from that shown above.
The risk exposure at the year end is considered to be representative of this year as a whole.
By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movements in price.
This risk concentration is managed within the Companys investment strategy as discussed in the Strategic Report.
iv Fair values The fair value of the investment portfolio is described in detail in the Portfolio valuation methodology section and in Note 7.
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying values 2014: same.
The sensitivity analysis in respect of the interest rate, currency and market price risks is considered to be representative of the Groups exposure to financial risks throughout the period to which they relate 2014: same.

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through profit or loss.
As at 31 March 2015, the notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Company was 527.6 million 2014: 330.0 million.
Interest rate swaps The Company uses interest rate swaps to minimise the effect of fluctuations in interest rates to fix the value of expected future cash payments payable on debt obligations resulting from non-recourse borrowings made by Oystercatcher Luxco 2 S. r. l. a subsidiary of the Company.
The fair value of these swaps is recorded in the balance sheet.
No swaps are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through profit or loss.
As at 31 March 2015, the notional amount of the interest rate swap contracts held by the Company was 58.0 million 2014: nil.
Fair value of derivatives The Company holds its over-the-counter derivatives at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
The valuation technique incorporates various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and uses present value calculations.
For these financial instruments, significant inputs into models are market observable and are included within Level 2.
There have been no reclassifications for derivatives that have been transferred in or out of Level 2 or Level 3 during the year 2014: nil.
11 Loans and borrowings On 2 May 2013 the Company entered into a three-year, unsecured 200 million revolving credit facility at a fixed margin above LIBOR.
The facility has certain loan covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio and loan to value ratio.
As at 31 March 2015, the Company had utilised the facility to issue Letters of Credit for the investments into A12, RIVM and La Sant which totalled 15.8 million 21.8 million 2014: nil.
These are disclosed as contingent liabilities in Note 17.
On 7 May 2015 the Company renewed this facility and increased the size of the facility to 300 million.
Please see Note 20 for more details.
On 20 February 2015, the Company signed two 10 month, unsecured bilateral facilities of 210 million each at a fixed margin above LIBOR.
The facilities have certain loan covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio and loan to value ratio.
