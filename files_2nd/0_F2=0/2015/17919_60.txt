The internal group reporting reects this business line structure.
Management monitors goodwill at operating segment level and goodwill has been allocated on this basis.
Goodwill that is specic to a particular operating segment has been included in the operating segment directly.
All other goodwill has been reallocated to the appropriate operating segments prospectively using the three-year average forecast operating cash ow of the time of thechange of composition of CGUs in 2012.
Under the existing business line structure, we have 23 CGUs which represent the smallest identiable group of assets that generate independent cash ows from other groups of assets.
For the purpose of a goodwill impairment review, acquired goodwill has been allocated to nine groups of CGUs being the operating segments.
The operating segments are Workwear, Facility, UK Flat Linen, Scandinavian Flat Linen, Germany & Austria Healthcare, Ireland, Direct Sales, Clinical Solutions and Decontamination.
For reporting purposes, the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments as outlined below: 2015 2014 Net book Net book Impairment amount of Impairment amount of charge goodwill charge goodwill m m m m Core Growth: Workwear 137.6 144.9 Facility 152.4 160.4 UK Flat Linen 19.9 19.9 Manage for Value: Scandinavian Flat Linen 36.5 37.5 Germany and Austria Healthcare 6.4 6.8 Ireland 2.1 2.2 Direct Sales 4.5 4.5 Clinical Solutions 14.0 14.0 Decontamination Total 6.4 367.0 390.2 Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 141 8 Goodwill continued Impairment testing of goodwill The group reviews at each reporting date whether there is an indication that any of the CGU that contains the operating assets may be impaired in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
An annual goodwill impairment test is then carried out by comparing the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each operating segment is based on value-in-use calculations which management develop from forecast cash ows based on past performance, market data and its expectation of future market development.
These calculations require the use of estimates and the pre-tax cash ow projections are based on the groups current three-year strategic plan.
The key target assumptions within the strategic plan for each of the CGUs may be summarised as follows: a Sustainable revenue growth, prior to currency impacts, of at least GDP 2%: a Continued margin improvement: and a Strong underlying cash ow reecting the group target range of 75%-90% cash conversion after targeted investments.
Cash ows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% 2014: 2% and are appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The growth rate of 2% 2014: 2% does not exceed long-term GDP estimates for countries that the group operates within.
Projected cash ows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates of 11% 2014: 11% except in respect of Germany and Austria Healthcare as referred to below where a rate of 13.75% has been used.
The discount rates reect market assumptions for the Risk Free-rates and Equity Risk Premiums and also take into account the net cost of debt.
No reasonably foreseeable change in these assumptions would cause an impairment except as set out below because the remaining CGUs have clear headroom under the modelling assumptions.
Impairment tests are carried out annually or when indicators show that assets may be impaired.
As part of our Strategy Update we reviewed the market structure of each of our businesses and the opportunities for growth and profit improvement.
We characterised the market structure in Germany Healthcare to be aggressively competitive and, while we have a good management and are making significant progress in our growth and profit improvement plans, there remains substantial free capacity within our plants, which we believe will take some time to ll.
Following this review we announced at the beginning of 2016, the closure of one of our German Healthcare plants where the services provided did not meet the requirements of our core portfolio and profit improvement agenda.
Accordingly, in evaluating the goodwill related to this business for impairment for 2015, we applied a higher risk factor, via an increased discount rate resulting in an impairment charge of 6.4 million, after which the goodwill in this part of the business has been fully written down.
No other class of assets has been impaired as their value is supported by their value in use calculation.
The key assumptions used for the value in use calculation are: a Modest revenue growth on a like-for-like basis in excess of the long-term growth rate, 2%, for each of the next three years: a Continued margin improvement to higher single digits over the next three years: and a More than 75% of profit converting to operating cash ow over the next three years.
If the above revenue and margin assumptions are not achieved then an impairment of other assets may become necessary.
The value of the goodwill impairment in the year is 6.4 million 2014:nil and is shown within the income statement as part of exceptional items see note 4.
