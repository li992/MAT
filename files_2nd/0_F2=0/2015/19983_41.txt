Acquisitions The Group accounts for acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
IFRS 3 requires the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities other than non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale to be recognised at fair value at acquisition date.
In assessing fair value at acquisition date, management make their best estimate of the likely outcome where the fair value of an asset or liability may be contingent on a future event.
In certain instances, the underlying transaction giving rise to an estimate may not be resolved until some years after the acquisition date.
IFRS 3 requires the release to profit of any acquisition reserves which subsequently become excess in the same way as any excess costs over those provided at acquisition date are charged to profit.
At each period end management assess provisions and other balances established in respect of acquisitions for their continued probability of occurrence and amend the relevant value accordingly through the consolidated income statement or as an adjustment to goodwill as appropriate under IFRS 3.
The Group acquired a number of subsidiaries in the year.
The following table sets out the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and their fair value to the Group.
The fair value adjustments for certain acquisitions have been determined provisionally at the balance sheet date.
