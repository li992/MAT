Rightmove plc annual report 2015 77 Notes continued 1 General information continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with the entity.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of the consolidated and Company financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
In particular, information about signi cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated and Company financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 2 j Revenue recognition, speci cally regarding the period to which services relate and the recognition of revenue from membership offers including discounted or free periods.
Notes 16 and 24 The choice of valuation methodology and the inputs and assumptions used to calculate the initial fair value for new sharebased incentives granted and the rate at which the related deferred tax asset is measured.
The key estimates used in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Companys shares at the grant date, expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and weighted average expected life of the instrument.
In respect of share-based incentives granted to employees, the number of share-based incentives that are expected to vest is based upon estimates of the number of employees that will forfeit their awards through leaving the Group and the likelihood of any non-market performance conditions being satis ed.
Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
2 Signi cant accounting policies a Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the parent Company financial statements.
b Intangible assets i Research and development The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing platforms.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in pro t or loss as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible, the Group has suf cient resources to complete development, future economic bene ts are probable and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic bene ts embodied in the speci c asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements ii Computer software and licences Computer software and externally acquired software licences are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software or licence by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 20.0% 33.3% per annum Software licences 20.0% 33.3% per annum c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Of ce equipment, xtures and ttings 20.0% per annum Computer equipment 20.0% 33.3% per annum Leasehold improvements remaining life of the lease d Impairment The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of nonfinancial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash ows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an inde nite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the Companys carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in pro t or loss.
In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and the Companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be suf cient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the receivables original terms.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade payables are classi ed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Money market deposits are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
They represent deposits with a maturity of over three months.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Rightmove plc annual report 2015 79 Notes continued 2 Signi cant accounting policies continued f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
g Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that re ects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
A provision is maintained in respect of lease dilapidations based on an estimated cost to make good per square foot multiplied by the oor area of each premise.
h Employee bene ts i Pensions The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme a fide ned contribution pension plan into which employees may elect to contribute via salary exchange.
Obligations for contributions to fide ned contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee bene t expense in pro t or loss when they are incurred.
ii Employee share schemes The Group provides share-based incentive plans allowing executive directors and other employees to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in pro t or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to acquire equity settled share-based incentives.
Fair value at the grant date is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option behaviour, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates based on government bonds.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining the fair value.
For share-based incentive awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based incentives is measured to re ect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
When either the employee or the Company chooses not to meet the non-vesting condition, the failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation and the cost that would have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in pro t or loss.
iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and, as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore re ected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
iv Own shares held by The Rightmove Share Incentive Plan Trust SIP The SIP is treated as an agent of Rightmove plc and, as such SIP transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove plc and are therefore re ected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the SIPs purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
v National Insurance NI on share-based incentives Employers NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when share-based incentives are exercised.
In the case of share options, it is provided on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options.
In the case of nil cost performance shares and deferred shares, it is provided based on the share price at the reporting date.
i Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.

The Board of directors monitors the spread of the Companys shareholders as well as underlying basic earnings per share.
The Board of directors has a progressive dividend policy in line with underlying earnings growth and also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to growth in pro t before tax.

Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Operational risks arise from all of the Groups operations.
The Groups objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Groups reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit.
This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas: requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions: requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions: compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements: Rightmove plc annual report 2015 83 Notes continued 4 Risk and capital management continued documentation of controls and procedures: requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address the risks identi ed: requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action: development and regular testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans: training and professional development: and risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.

co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements 24 Share-based payments The Group and Company operate share-based incentive schemes for executive directors and employees.
Since otation, the Company has awarded share options under the Rightmove Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan Unapproved Plan and the Rightmove Approved Executive Share Option Plan Approved Plan.
The Group also operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave Plan, a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSP and Performance Share Plan PSP and, in January 2015, the Rightmove Share Incentive Plan SIP was introduced.
All share-based incentives are subject to a service condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service received.
The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the share-based incentives is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
During 2013, the Group amended the rules of the Unapproved Plan to enable such awards to be net settled whereby the number of shares released and sold to satisfy the award is equivalent to the gain due to the option holder.
Consequently no proceeds are received on exercise of unapproved share options.
The total share-based payments charge for the year relating to all share-based incentive plans was 3,765,000 2014: 2,728,000.
A 2% reduction or increase in the employee leaver assumption excluding executive directors for the DSP and the PSP would have increased decreased the share-based payments charge in the year by 49,000 2014: 23,000.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the awards are exercised, based on the share price at the reporting date.
NI for the year ended 31 December 2015 relating to all awards was a charge of 3,331,000 compared to a credit of 194,000 in the prior year, due to an increase in the share price from 22.48 at 31 December 2014 to 41.25 at 31 December 2015.
The Company NI charge for the year was 2,605,000 2014: credit 301,000.
