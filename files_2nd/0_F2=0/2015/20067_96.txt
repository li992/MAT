128 BT plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2015 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an adjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specific items.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures.
The non-GAAP measures we use are: the trend in underlying revenue excluding transit, and in underlying operating costs excluding transit, as well as in reported and adjusted EBITDA.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specific items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specific items.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups financial performance, as specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
This presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the BT Group plc Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and or prior years include disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, historic insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years.
In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are also treated as specific items.
Specific items are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trends in underlying revenue and operating costs Underlying revenue and underlying operating costs are measures which seek to reflect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
As such they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specific items.
We focus on the trends in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, as transit traffic is low-margin and is significantly affected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
A reconciliation from the decrease in reported revenue and reported operating costs, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the decrease in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, is set out below.
