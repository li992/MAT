The adjustment for share-based payment relates to the impact of the accounting standard for share-based compensation.
The annual bonus is paid in amixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another.
Under IFRS the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by adding to or deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the effective value of the annual share award in order to better match the underlying staff costs in the year with the revenue recognised in the same period.
The gross amounts of the above adjustments Note 8 are amortisation of intangible assets excluding software 3.6m 2014: 2.6m, impairment of available-for-sale investment nil 2014: 0.6m, share-based payment adjustment 2.8m credit 2014: 2.9m credit, restructuring costs of 1.6m 2014: 0.9m, profit on disposals of 2.9m 2014: 2.0m and acquisition-related costs of 23.3m 2014:16.6m.
