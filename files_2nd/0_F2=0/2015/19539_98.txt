Net debt and capital structure continued 13 Financial instruments This note shows details of the fair value and carrying value of short and long term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term bank deposits, cash at bank and in hand and other financial liabilities.
These items are all classified as financial instruments under accounting standards.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
In order to assist users of these financial statements in making an assessment of any risks relating to financial instruments, this note also shows the ageing of these items and analyses their sensitivity to changes in key inputs, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Credit risk is further disclosed in the Directors Report.
Accounting policy Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
13.1 Fair values of financial instruments For the following financial assets and liabilities: trade and other payables excluding tax and social security, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and accrued income, short-term bank deposits, cash at bank and in hand and other financial liabilities, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument with the exception of borrowings due to these bearing interest at fixed rates which are currently higher than floating rates.
The fair value of borrowings is determined by reference to interest rate movements on the US $ private placement market and therefore can be considered as a level 2 fair value as defined within IFRS 13.

13.4 Other financial liabilities Accounting policy The Group makes use of contingent contracts for the purchase of its own shares.
These derivative contracts are accounted for as equity transactions and the contracts are not stated at their market values.
The present value of the obligation to purchase the shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when that obligation is conditional.
Any subsequent reduction in the total obligation arising from the early termination of a contract is credited back to equity at the time of termination.
Any embedded derivative assets arising out of any debt contracts are classified within other current and other non-current assets according to when they can be exercised.
The Group makes use of put and call options as part of its ongoing acquisition activity.
The fair value of these options are measured at each reporting date and the fair value gains or losses are taken to the income statement.

The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates, and sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis assumes reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 1%, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates of 10% are shown, reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over the last year.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the consolidated income statement and equity.
