48 Pension obligations a Introduction The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.

The assets and liabilities of these defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2015 are shown below.

The smaller ones, while still measured under IAS 19, are included as one total within Provisions see note 47.
Similarly, while the charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section b i below, the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section d below.
The assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long-term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
