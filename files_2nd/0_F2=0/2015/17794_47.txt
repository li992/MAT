1 Estimated Mineral Resources are presented on an exclusive basis, i. e. Mineral Resources are reported as additional to Ore Reserves unless otherwise stated.
Please refer to the detailed Mineral Resource estimates tables in the AA plc R&R Report forthe detailed Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resource estimates.
The Mineral Resource estimates are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
TheMineral Resource estimates for operations in South Africa are reported in accordance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended July 2009.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources.
Anglo American plc ownership is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
2 Total Inferred is the sum of Inferred in LOM Plan, the Inferred Resources within the scheduled Life of Mine Plan LOM Plan and Inferred ex.
LOM Plan, the portion of Inferred Resources with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction not considered in the Life of Mine Plan LOM Plan as relevant.
3 The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources attributable to Anglo American Platinum unless otherwise noted.
Details of the individual operations appear in the Anglo American Platinum Annual Report.
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are estimated over apractical minimum mining width suitable for the deposit the Resource Cut.
The Resource Cut width takes cognisance of the mining method and geotechnical aspects in the hangingwall or footwall of the reef.
4E is the sum of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold.
4 DBCi fide Beers Canada, DBCM fide Beers Consolidated Mines, Debswana Debswana Diamond Company, Namdeb Namdeb Holdings.
Estimated Diamond Resources are presented on an exclusive basis, i. e. Diamond Resources are quoted as additional to Diamond Reserves.
Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes cpht or as carats per square meter cpm.
Reported Diamond Resources are based on a Bottom Cut-Off BCO which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 1.00mm and 3.00mm nominal square mesh.
Specific BCOs applied to derive estimates are included in the detailed Diamond Resource tables in the AA plc R&R Report.
6 Tonnes and grades are on a dry basis.
7 Mineral Resources are quoted as inclusive of those used to calculate Ore Reserves and must not be added to the Ore Reserves.
8 GEMCO Manganese grades are given as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective yields, see page 33 in the AA plc R&R Report.
9 Coal Resources are quoted on a Mineable Tonnes In Situ MTIS basis in million tonnes, which are in addition to those Coal Resources that have been modified to produce the reported Coal Reserves.
Coal Resources are reported on an in situ moisture basis.
The coal quality for Coal Resources is quoted on an in situ heat content askilo-calories per kilogram kcal kg, representing Calorific Value CV on a Gross As Received GAR basis.
CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg.
