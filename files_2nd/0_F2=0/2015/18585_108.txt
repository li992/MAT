As part of this process, a review has been conducted to ensure consistent and appropriate classication and reporting across the Group and its segments which has resulted in a number of classication adjustments within property, plant and equipment.
This reclassication has no impact on the net book value of property, plant and equipment reported at each year-end or the income statement for any year but, within the stated total for PP&E, has reduced the opening balance of assets in construction at 1 January 2014 by 401 million and increased the opening balances of land and buildings and plant, equipment and vehicles by 183 million and 218 million, respectively, with equivalent adjustments to the reclassications reported in 2014.
