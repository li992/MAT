Proved reserves replacement Total hydrocarbon proved reserves at 31 December 2015, on an oil equivalent basis including equity-accounted entities, decreased by 2% decrease of 5% for subsidiaries and increase of 1% for equity-accounted entities compared with 31 December 2014.
Natural gas represented about 44% 57% for subsidiaries and 30% for equity-accounted entities of these reserves.
The change includes a net increase from acquisitions and disposals of 130mmboe 103mmboe within our subsidiaries and 28mmboe within our equity-accounted entities.
Acquisition activity in our subsidiaries occurred in Egypt, Trinidad, the US and the UK, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in Egypt, Trinidad, the US and the UK.
In our equity-accounted entities the most significant item was a purchase in Russia.
The proved reserves replacement ratio is the extent to which production is replaced by proved reserves additions.
This ratio is expressed in oil equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries.
For 2015, the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals was 61% 63% in 2014 and 129% in 2013 for subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities, 28% for subsidiaries alone and 115% for equity-accounted entities alone.
The ratio reflects lower reserves bookings as a result of a low number of final investment decisions adding new projects and reduced activity in Alaska and the US Lower 48.
Lower prices impacted the reserves in a number of regions, but these were largely offset by increases in reserves in our PSAs.
In some cases, cost recovery in PSAs may be limited by production or revenue caps.
