Rights and restrictions relating to share capital Convertible participating shares Convertible participating shares were originally issued to Altria as part of the Miller Brewing Company transaction in 2002 but were subsequently converted into ordinary shares.
There are no convertible participating shares currently in issue.
Altria is however entitled to require the company to convert its ordinary shares back into convertible participating shares so as to ensure that Altrias voting shareholding does not exceed 24.99% of the total voting shareholding.
If Altrias ordinary shares were converted into convertible participating shares, the convertible participating shares would rank pari passu with the ordinary shares of the company in relation to a distribution of the profits of the company and a return of capital.
On a poll vote at general meetings of the company, Altria would be entitled to vote in respect of its convertible participating shares on the basis of one-tenth of a vote for every convertible participating share on all resolutions other than a resolution: i proposed by any person other than Altria, to wind up the company: ii proposed by any person other than Altria, to appoint an administrator or to approve any arrangement with the companys creditors: iii proposed by the board, to sell all or substantially all of the undertaking of the company: or iv proposed by any person other than Altria, to alter any of the class rights attaching to the convertible participating shares or to approve the creation of any new class of shares, in which case Altria would be entitled on a poll to vote on the resolution on the basis of one vote for each convertible participating share.

Share capital continued Conversion into ordinary shares If Altrias ordinary shares are converted into convertible participating shares, the provisions governing possible conversion back into ordinary shares would apply.
These state that upon a transfer of convertible participating shares by Altria to any person other than to an affiliate of Altria, such convertible participating shares shall convert into ordinary shares.
In addition, Altria is entitled to require the company to convert its convertible participating shares into ordinary shares in the event of a takeover offer for the company, or a third party acquiring more than a 24.99% voting shareholding, provided certain conditions are met.
The company must use its best endeavours to procure that the ordinary shares arising on conversion of the convertible participating shares are admitted to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities, admitted to listing and trading on the JSE Ltd, and admitted to listing and trading on any other stock exchange upon which the ordinary shares are from time to time listed and traded, but no admission to listing or trading need be sought for the convertible participating shares while they remain convertible participating shares.
Deferred shares The deferred shares do not carry any voting rights and do not entitle their holders to receive any dividends or other distributions.
In the event of a winding up deferred shareholders would receive no more than the nominal value.
Deferred shares represent the only non-equity share capital of thegroup.

A total of 46.2 million new shares in The South African Breweries Pty Ltd SAB, representing 8.45% of SABs enlarged issued share capital, were issued.
The shares in SAB will be exchanged at the end of the estimated 10-year scheme term for shares in SABMiller plc based on a repurchase formula linked, inter alia, to the operating performance of SAB.
No performance conditions and exercise prices are attached to these shares, although the employee component has a four-year vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of each SAB share at the grant date was ZAR40.
Weighted average fair value assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a binomial model approach except for the awards under Performance Share Award schemes, the Executive Share Award Plan 2008 including value share awards and the BBBEE scheme which have been valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
The Monte Carlo simulation methodology is necessary for valuing share-based payments with TSR performance hurdles.
This is achieved by projecting SABMiller plcs share price forwards, together with those of companies in the same comparator group, over the vesting period and or life of the awards after considering their respective volatilities.
