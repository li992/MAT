Financials 188 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2015 D: Other income statement notes D1: Income tax expense This note analyses the income tax expense recognised in profit or loss for the year and the various factors that have contributed to the composition of the charge.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred taxation is provided using the temporary difference method.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax base.
The amount of deferred taxation provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the specific jurisdiction.
Deferred taxation is charged to profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to a transaction that is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or a business combination that is an acquisition.
The effect on deferred taxation of any changes in tax rates is recognised in profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items previously charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available, against which the unutilised tax losses and deductible temporary differences can be used.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.
In certain circumstances, as permitted by accounting guidance, deferred tax balances are not recognised.
In particular where the liability relates to the initial recognition of goodwill, or transactions that are not a business combination and at the time of their occurrence affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
H7 includes further detail of circumstances in which the Group does not recognise temporary differences.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income and the statement of changes in equity respectively.
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Groups tax charge and worldwide provisions for income tax necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
At any given time the Group typically has a number of open tax returns with various tax authorities and engages in active dialogue to resolve this.
Taxation provisions relating to these open items are recognised based on the Groups estimate of the most likely outcome, after taking into account external advice where appropriate.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact profit or loss, current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period such determination is made.
