The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment arise.
This testing applies a fair value less costs of disposal methodology, generally using post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for country and currency specic risks.
This valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between nil and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these intangible assets.
