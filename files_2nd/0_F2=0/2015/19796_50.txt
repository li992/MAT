During the prior year, it was concluded that the level of service provided to tenants of some malls operated by the Group were no longer considered insignificant and as a result a number of malls with a net book value of 1,623m were reclassified from investment property to property, plant and equipment.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, each store is a cash-generating unit.
Cash-generating units are tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal.
The Group engaged external independent qualified valuers, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of the Groups property.
Fair values are determined in regard to the market rent for the stores or for alternative uses with investment yields appropriate to reflect the physical characteristics of the property and the location.
In some cases, fair values include residual valuations where stores may be viable for redevelopment.
Value in use is generally calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecast, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of 2% to 5% 2014: 2% to 5%.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 9% to 12% 2014: 6% to 14% depending on the specific conditions in which each store operates.
On a post-tax basis, the discount rates range from 7% to 10% 2014: 6% to 12%.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region.
An impairment charge of 4,292m 2014: 866m has been recognised following a challenging economic climate and significant shifts in the retail industry structure, resulting in a revision of forecast cash flows and property fair values.
This charge relates to properties in the UK of 3,052m 2014: 87m, Europe of 947m 2014: 740m and Asia of 293m 2014: 39m.
