Financial instruments continued There were no movements between different levels of the fair value hierarchy in the year.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to the carrying amount because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2015 is a net liability of 0.4m 2014: 0.3m, of which 0.2m has been debited to the hedging reserve 2014: 0.3m and 0.2m debited to the Consolidated Income Statement 2014: nil.
These contracts mature over periods typically not exceeding 18 months.
A summary of the movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.
In accordance with IFRS, all of the cash flow hedges in 2015 and 2014 were deemed to be effective.
The fair value of deferred and contingent consideration is determined by considering the performance expectations of the acquired entity and applying the entity specific discount rate.
The unobservable inputs are the projected forecast measures that are assessed on an annual basis.
Changes in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration relating to updated projected forecast performance measures are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period that the change occurs.

The following table shows the total outstanding contractual forward exchange contracts hedging designated transactional exposures split by currencies which have been sold back into the functional currency of the underlying business.
These contracts typically mature in the next 18 months and, therefore, the cash flows and resulting effect on the Consolidated Income Statement are expected to occur within this time period.
