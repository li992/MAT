Intangible assets continued Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the perpetuity growth rates.
As the carrying value of goodwill in the Growth market CGUs has been written down to nil, the value of other intangible assets in Brazil and China is sensitive to any increase in discount rates or reduction in perpetuity growth rates.
In the North America and Core CGUs goodwill has been written down to fair value less costs of disposal and any further increase in discount rates or reduction in perpetuity growth rates would give rise to further impairment.
A 0.1% increase in discount rates would cause the fair value less costs of disposal of the Brazil, China, North America and Core CGUs to reduce by 3m, 5m, 120m and 25m respectively.
A 0.1% reduction in perpetuity growth rates would cause the fair value less costs of disposal of the Brazil, China, North America and Core CGUs to reduce by 2m, 5m, 100m and 21m respectively.
All CGUs which have been written down to fair value less costs of disposal are highly sensitive to any reductions in short-term cash ows, whether driven by lower sales growth, lower operating pro ts or lower cash conversion.
A 5% reduction in total annual operating pro ts, spread evenly across all CGUs, would give rise to an impairment of 29m in the Growth CGUs, 241m in the North America CGU and 62m in the Core CGU.
2014 impairment tests In 2014 following deterioration in the market conditions for the Groups online tutoring business based in India, it was determined in the course of the impairment review that the value in use of the India CGU no longer supported the carrying value of the goodwill in that CGU.
An impairment of 67m was booked, thereby bringing the carrying value of goodwill in the India CGU down to nil.
An impairment of 10m was also booked in respect of other acquired intangibles in that CGU, bringing their carrying value to nil.
The India CGU incorporates all the Groups trading operations in India.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.6% was used to determine the value in use of the India CGU.
No previous assessment had been made of the value in use of that CGU as the Groups India operations, prior to the 1 January 2014 reorganisation, were previously part of a larger Emerging Markets aggregated CGU.
