The purpose of these transfers is to ensure that the total dividend distribution is less than the total distributable results for that year.
Transfer to general reserves also includes US$30 million of debenture redemption reserve and US$4.5 million of remeasurement reserve.
3 The merger reserve arose on incorporation of the Company during the year ended 31 March 2004.
The investment in Twin Star had a carrying amount value of US$20.0 million in the accounts of Volcan.
As required by the Companies Act 1985, Section 132, upon issue of 156,000,000 ordinary shares to Volcan, Twin Stars issued share capital and share premium account have been eliminated and a merger reserve of US$4.4 million arose, being the difference between the carrying value of the investment in Twin Star in Volcans accounts and the nominal value of the shares issued to Volcan.
