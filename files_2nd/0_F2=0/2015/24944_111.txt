8 Tax Accounting policy Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the same statement in which the related item appears.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year, calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
HSBC provides for potential current tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when HSBC intends to settle on a net basis and the legal right to offset exists.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and when HSBC has a legal right to offset.
Deferred tax relating to actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax relating to share-based payment transactions is recognised directly in equity to the extent that the amount of the estimated future tax deduction exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense.
Deferred tax relating to fair value re-measurements of available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedging instruments is charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognised in the income statement when the deferred fair value gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 369 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Notes on the Financial Statements continued 8 Tax 9 Dividends Critical accounting estimates and judgements Deferred tax assets The recognition of a deferred tax asset relies on an assessment of the probability and sufficiency of future taxable profits, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies.
In the absence of a history of taxable profits, the most significant judgements relate to expected future profitability and to the applicability of tax planning strategies, including corporate reorganisations.
In previous years the US deferred tax recognition relied on capital support from HSBC Holdings plc due to significant losses in the past.
The US has been profitable in recent years and the improved performance is expected to continue, so the US deferred tax recognition is now based on projections of future business profits.

The Hong Kong tax rate applying to the profits of subsidiaries assessable in Hong Kong was 16.5% 2014: 16.5%: 2013: 16.5%.
Other overseas subsidiaries and overseas branches provided for taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operated.
Tax reconciliation The tax charged to the income statement differs from the tax charge that would apply if all profits had been taxed at the UK corporation tax rate as follows: 2015 2014 2013 $m % $m % $m % Profit before tax 18,867 18,680 22,565 Tax expense Tax at 20.25% 2014: 21.5%: 2013: 23.25% 3,821 20.25 4,016 21.5 5,246 23.25 Effect of differently taxed overseas profits 71 0.4 33 0.2 177 0.8 Adjustments in respect of prior period liabilities 68 0.4 108 0.6 117 0.5 Deferred tax temporary differences not recognised previously not recognised 205 1.1 154 0.8 332 1.5 Effect of profits in associates and joint ventures 508 2.7 547 2.9 543 2.4 Tax effect of disposal of Ping An 111 0.5 Tax effect of reclassification of Industrial Bank 317 1.4 Non-taxable income and gains 728 3.9 668 3.5 871 3.9 Permanent disallowables 978 5.2 969 5.1 647 2.9 Change in tax rates 110 0.6 22 0.1 93 0.4 Local taxes and overseas withholding taxes 416 2.2 434 2.3 551 2.4 Other items 116 0.6 22 0.1 32 0.1 Year ended 31 December 3,771 20.0 3,975 21.3 4,765 21.1 The Groups profits are taxed at different rates depending on the country in which the profits arise.
The key applicable tax rates include Hong Kong 16.5%, USA 35% and UK 20.25%.
If the Groups profits were taxed at the statutory rates of the countries in which the profits arise then the tax rate for the year would have been 20.65%.
The effective tax rate for the year was 20.0% 2014: 21.3% and is in line with expectations.
We expect the effective tax rate to increase due to the introduction of the 8% surcharge on UK banking profits in 2016.
Accounting for taxes involves some estimation because the tax law is uncertain and the application requires a degree of judgement, which authorities may dispute.
Liabilities are recognised based on best estimates of the probable outcome, taking into account external advice where appropriate.
We do not expect significant liabilities to arise in excess of the amounts provided.
HSBC only recognises current and deferred tax assets where recovery is probable.
