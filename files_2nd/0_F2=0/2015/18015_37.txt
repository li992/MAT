Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 120 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6 Segmental information The Groups operations are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit offering a different package of related services across the Groups markets.
A description of the service provision for each segment can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 60.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable operating segments below.
The information disclosed below represents the way in which the results of the businesses were reported to the Group Board.
The reported segmental structure has been changed in the year and therefore the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Before eliminating sales between business units on consolidation, the Group accounts for sales between business units as if they were to a third party at market rates.
The tables below present revenue, result and certain asset and liability information for the Groups business segments for the years 2015 and 2014.
The 2014 consolidated income statement has not been restated for the impact of business exits and other non-underlying items.
If the 2014 underlying consolidated income statement was restated, revenue would be reduced by 192.8m and profit before tax would reduce by 10.9m.
