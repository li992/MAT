Principal Accounting Policies Accounting policies describe the Companys approach to recognising and measuring transactions during the year and the position of the Company at the year end.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied during the year and the preceding year, unless otherwise stated.
a Basis of Preparation Accounting Standards applied The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain fixed assets, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
The financial statements are also prepared on a going concern basis.
The disclosures on going concern in the Directors Report on pages 20 and 21 form part of the financial statements.
b Foreign Currency and Segmental Reporting i Functional and presentational currency The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency and the currency in which the Companys share capital and expenses, as well as its assets and liabilities, are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies, whether of a revenue or capital nature, are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any gains or losses, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital reserve or to the revenue reserve, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
iii Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business of investing in equity and debt securities, issued by companies quoted mainly on the UK or other regulated stock exchanges.
c Financial Instruments i Recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company will offset financial assets and financial liabilities if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and interests and intends to settle on a net basis.
ii Derecognition of financial assets The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in the transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as an asset.
iii Derecognition of financial liabilities The Company derecognises financial liabilities when its obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
iv Trade date accounting Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.
44 PIGIT pp36 58 PIGIT pp36 58 05 06 2015 11:40 Page 45 FINANCIAL v Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The Companys investments are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, with transaction costs expensed in the income statement, and are subsequently valued at fair value.
Fair value for investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted bid prices at the balance sheet date.
For investments that are not actively traded or where active stock exchange quoted bid prices are not available, fair value is determined by reference to a variety of valuation techniques including broker quotes and price modelling.
Where there is no active market, unlisted illiquid investments are valued by the Directors at fair value based on recommendations from Invescos Pricing Committee, which in turn is guided by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Guidelines, using valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, recent arms length transactions and net assets.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
d Hedging and Derivatives Forward currency contracts entered into for hedging purposes are valued at the appropriate forward exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits or losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves.
Futures contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes and any profits and losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Derivative instruments may be capital or revenue in nature and, accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognised in revenue or capital in the income statement as appropriate.
e Income Dividend income arises from equity investments held and is recognised on the date investments are marked ex-dividend.
Deposit interest and underwriting commission receivable are taken into account on an accruals basis.
Interest income arising from fixed income securities and cash is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
f Expenses and Finance Costs Expenses are recognised on an accruals basis and finance costs are recognised using the effective interest method in the income statement.
The investment management fee and finance costs are allocated 70% to capital and 30% to revenue.
This is in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the portfolio.
The performance fee is allocated wholly to capital as it arises from capital returns on the portfolio.
Investment transaction costs are recognised in capital in the income statement.
All other expenses are allocated to revenue in the income statement.

Principal Accounting Policies continued g Taxation The liability for corporation tax is based on net revenue for the year excluding dividends.
The tax charge is allocated between the revenue and capital account on the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the Directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of surplus management expenses, losses on loan relationships and eligible unrelieved foreign tax, as the Company is unlikely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these.
h Dividends Dividends are not recognised in the financial statements unless there is an obligation to pay at the balance sheet date.
Proposed dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid to shareholders.
Income This note shows the income generated from the portfolio investment assets of the Company and income received from any other source.

Taxation As an investment trust the Company pays no tax on capital gains.
The Company also suffers no tax on income arising on UK and certain overseas dividends, mainly EU ones.
As a result, the Companys tax charge arises solely from irrecoverable tax on overseas dividends.
Lastly, this note clarifies the basis for the Company having no deferred tax asset or liability.

A deferred tax asset, measured at the standard rate of corporation tax of20% 2014: 20%, of 30,538,000 2014: 27,677,000 has not been recognised in respect of these expenses since they are recoverable only to the extent that the Company has sufficient future taxable revenue.
Return per Ordinary Share Return per share is the amount of gain generated for the financial year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
2015 2014 000 000 Returns after tax: revenue 33,649 31,652 capital 69,447 113,711 total 103,096 145,363 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year: basic 234,687,535 227,407,467 diluted potential shares arising from subscription shares n a 2,040,967 total 234,687,535 229,448,434 48 PIGIT pp36 58 PIGIT pp36 58 05 06 2015 11:40 Page 49 FINANCIAL The subscription shares were all exercised in 2013, so there is no dilution in 2015.
For 2014, the diluted return per ordinary share was based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during that year, as adjusted in accordance with the requirements of FRS22 Earnings per Share.
In calculating the diluted return, the exercise of the subscription shares was assumed, with the exercise proceeds of 218.94p per share used to purchase ordinary shares at a price of 344.83p, being the average market price up to the subscription share exercise date.
Dividends on Ordinary Shares Dividends represent the return of income to shareholders.
The Company pays four interim dividends a year.
Investments at Fair Value The portfolio comprises investments which are listed, i. e. traded on a regulated stock exchange, and a small proportion of investments which are valued by the Directors as they are unlisted or not regularly traded.
Gains and losses in the year are either: realised, usually arising when investments are sold: or unrealised, being the difference from cost on those investments still held at the year end.

Debtors Debtors are amounts which are due to the Company, such as monies due from brokers for investments sold and income which has been earned accrued but not yet received.
Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Creditors are amounts which must be paid by the Company and are split between those due within 12 months of the balance sheet date and those due after that time.
The main creditors are the bank overdraft and, for last year only, the debenture as the latter matured within 3 months of the balance sheet date.

During the year, the covenant under the facility requiring total assets to not fall below 520 million, was decreased to 440 million.
There were no other changes to the facility agreement.
The 30 million debenture was fully redeemed on 8 July 2014.
Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year These creditors are amounts due, as shown by note 11, but are due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date.

The Notes have a fixed interest rate of 4.37% per annum payable biannually on 8 May and 8 November.
Issue costs are amortised over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method.
The Notes are secured by a first floating charge over the Companys assets.
Under the trust deed, total borrowings must not exceed 25% of the Adjusted Capital and Reserves as defined therein.
Share Capital Share capital represents the total number of shares in issue, on which dividends accrue.
No shares have been issued or bought back subsequent to the year end.
The final opportunity to exercise subscription shares occurred on 31 August 2013.
On 10 September 2013, the remaining 12,914,737 subscription shares were converted into the same number of ordinary shares at a price of 218.94 pence per share.
Reserves This note explains the different reserves attributable to shareholders.
The aggregate of the reserves and share capital see previous note make up total shareholders funds.
The share premium arises on the issue of new shares and is non-distributable.
The capital reserve includes the unrealised investment holding gains losses, being the difference between cost and market value at the balance sheet date, totalling a gain of 319,300,000 2014: 261,467,000.
The capital and revenue reserves are distributable.
Net Asset Value The Companys total net assets total assets less total liabilities are often termed shareholders funds and are converted into net asset value per ordinary share by dividing by the number of shares in issue.

Related Party Transactions and Transactions with the Manager A related party is a company or individual who has direct or indirect control or who has significant influence over the Company.
Under accounting standards, the Manager is not a related party.
Under UK GAAP, the Company has identified the Directors as related parties.
The Directors remuneration and interests have been disclosed on pages 32 to 34 with additional disclosure in note 4.
No other related parties have been identified.
Up to 22 July 2014, the Manager was Invesco Asset Management Limited, at which date Invesco Fund Managers Limited was appointed.
Details of this change and the Managers services and fees are disclosed in the Directors Report on page 26 and note 3.
Financial Instruments Financial instruments comprise the Companys investment portfolio, derivative financial instruments if the Company had any, as well as any cash, borrowings, other receivables and other payables.
The Companys strategy for managing investment risk is determined with regard to the Companys Investment Policy, as shown on page 10.
The management of market risk is part of the investment management process.
The Companys portfolio is managed in accordance with the internal controls and risk management systems as described in the sections thereon in the Corporate Governance Statement page 23 and in the Audit Committee Report page 29.
The overall disposition of the Companys assets is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Companys financial instruments comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages15 and 16 cash, borrowings including overdraft and debenture, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The principal risks that an investment company faces in its portfolio management activities are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.

Financial Instruments continued Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities of the Company as more fully described in the Business Review.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to meet its investment objective and policies.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The risks applicable to the Company and the policies the Company used to manage these risks for the two years under review follow.
Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys direct exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance.
No other derivative or hedging instruments are utilised to manage market risk.
Gearing is used to enhance returns, but this also increases the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to US dollars and Swiss francs.
Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objective and policies.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset denominated in those currencies.
During the year, no forward currency contracts were used by the Company 2014: none.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
31 MARCH 2015 31 MARCH 2014 US SWISS US SWISS DOLLAR FRANC DOLLAR FRANC 000 000 000 000 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 426 835 401 986 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 73,371 60,012 56,229 69,523 Total net foreign currency exposure 73,797 60,847 56,630 70,509 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year using exchange rates for sterling to US dollars and Swiss francs.
It is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and takes account of any forward foreign exchange contracts, if used, that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
54 PIGIT pp36 58 PIGIT pp36 58 05 06 2015 11:40 Page 55 FINANCIAL The exchange rate of 4.5% 2014: 3.4% for US dollars and 3.3% 2014: 1.3% for Swiss francs has been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable foreign currency against the mean.
If sterling had strengthened, this would have had the following effect: 31 MARCH 2015 31 MARCH 2014 US SWISS US SWISS DOLLAR FRANC DOLLAR FRANC 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit loss after taxation Revenue return 73 74 58 39 Capital return 3,321 2,008 1,925 917 Total loss after taxation for the year 3,394 2,082 1,983 956 If sterling had weakened against the currencies above, the effect would have been the exact opposite.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure may change frequently as part of the currency risk management process of the Company.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate of the Custodian.
At the year end the Company had an uncommitted bank overdraft facility based on the lower of 25% of the net assets of the Company and 110 million 2014: 130 million.
The Company uses the facility when required at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The Company also has in issue 60 million 4.37% senior secured notes 2029 Notes.
At the year end drawings on the Companys overdraft were 90,221,000 2014: 97,693,000 and the Notes had an amortised cost of 59,398,000 2014: debenture: 29,982,000.
At the maximum overdraft of 110 million, the effect of a 1% in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the Companys income statement of 1.1 million.
At the previous and current year ends the Company had no investment in, and thus exposure to, any debt securities.
Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the Manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return for an acceptable level of risk.
Management of other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and as a result is not correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.

The three levels set out in FRS29 follow.
Level 1 fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 fair values based on valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 fair values based on valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
All bar one of the quoted equity investments are deemed to be Level 1.

The Companys total capital employed is managed to achieve the Companys investment objective and policy as set out on pages10 and11, including that borrowings may be used to raise equity exposure up to a maximum of 25% of net assets.
At the balance sheet date, gross gearing of 15.3% 2014: 14.2% and equalled net gearing.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding year.
The main risks to the Companys investments are shown in the Directors Report under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 12 to 14.
These also explain that the Company is able to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio.
The Board can also manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy back shares and it also determines dividend payments.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by Section 1159 Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility, by the terms imposed by the custodian.
The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements.
This is unchanged from the prior year.
Current year borrowings comprise a bank overdraft and senior secured notes, details of which are given in notes11 and 12.
