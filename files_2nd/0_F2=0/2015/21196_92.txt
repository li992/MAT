These loan notes are carried at fair value, their values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity premium, and are therefore classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, depending on whether observable market prices are available for the loan note.
These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.
