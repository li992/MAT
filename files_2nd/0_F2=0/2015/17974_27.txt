In testing for impairment the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is based on the discounted future net cash flows of oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period.
For exploration assets, estimated discounted cash flows are risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using an estimated short-term oil price based on the forward curve and long-term oil price of US$80 per boe 2014: long-term oil price of US$90 per boe, escalation for prices and costs of 2.0% 2014: 2.5%, and a discount rate of 10% 2014: 10%.
