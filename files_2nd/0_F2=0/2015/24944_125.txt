23 Assets held for sale and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale Accounting policy Assets held for sale Assets and liabilities of disposal groups and non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use.
Held-for-sale assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell, except for those assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Immediately before the initial classification as held for sale, the carrying amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities are measured in accordance with applicable IFRSs.
On subsequent remeasurement of a disposal group, the carrying amounts of any assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5, but are included in a disposal group classified as held for sale, are remeasured under applicable IFRSs before the fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group is determined.
2015 2014 $m $m Held for sale at 31 December Disposal groups 41,715 6,883 Non-current assets held for sale 2,185 764 Total assets 43,900 7,647 Liabilities of disposal groups 36,840 6,934 Disposal groups Brazil In the first half of 2015, we announced the plan to sell our operations in Brazil.
At 31 December 2015, the sale was considered highly probable and therefore the assets and liabilities of the disposal group were classified as held for sale.
The disposal group includes the assets and liabilities expected to be sold plus allocated goodwill as set out in the table on page 417.
The disposal group is measured at its carrying amount at 31 December 2015, which is lower than its fair value less cost to sell.
The carrying amount includes a $1.3bn deferred tax asset and $1.3bn of allocated goodwill see Note 20.
The assets and liabilities of the disposal group have been reclassified from their individual lines in the consolidated balance sheet and are presented in separate Held for sale lines at 31 December 2015.
There is no change to the comparative balance sheet presentation and there is no separate presentation in the income statement.
At 31 December 2015, there were no significant accounting implications in respect of the planned sale although this may evolve as it progresses.
The disposal group represents a foreign operation and when the disposal completes the cumulative amount of associated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to the income statement.
At 31 December 2015, there was a cumulative loss of $2.6bn in the Groups foreign exchange reserve attributable to the Brazilian operations.
