STRATEGIC OUR FINANCIAL SHAREHOLDER REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
OPERATING SEGMENTS The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Groups strategic business units.
Car Servicing became a reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010.
The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies.
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores.
The operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from autocentres.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors.
Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the Executive Directors on a monthly basis.
Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments.
Performance is measured based on segment operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
These internal reports are prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements.
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or Group of customers.
All revenue is from external customers.

A non-recurring expense of 7.5m was incurred in 2011.
This expense related to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989.
The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased by Payless DIY now part of Focus DIY when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under ownership of the Ward White Group.
Focus DIY entered into administration in May 2011.
In the current year the continued settlement of the Groups guarantor obligations has resulted in a release of 0.2m 2014: 0.2m of the original amounts provided.
There is now no outstanding provision in relation to this issue.
A charge was incurred in prior periods relating to stores where the present value of expected future cash flows was deemed to be insufficient to cover the lower of cost of exit or value in use.
During the current year a release of 0.2m occurred following the finalisation of an exit agreement for the Wembley store.
c. Impairment charge in respect of property, plant and equipment, in respect of the Stores Fit To Shop initiative, where the carrying amount of these assets has been deemed to exceed the recoverable amount.
d. The tax charge of 0.1m represents a tax rate of 21% applied to non-recurring items after adjusting for the non-deductibility of the asset impairment charge and settlements to release Halfords from its guarantor obligations under the leases.
The prior period represents a tax charge at 23% on all current year non-recurring items adjusted for the non-deductibility of the asset impairment charge and settlements to release Halfords from its guarantor obligations under the leases.

Further reductions to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 3 April 2015 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax rate was 21% 2014: 23%.
The effective tax rate of 21.5% 2014: 23.5% is higher than the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure and other permanent differences arising in the period.
The tax charge on profit for the financial period was 18.0m 2014: 17.1m, including a 0.1m charge 2014: 0.1m charge in respect of tax on nonrecurring items.

TAXATION CONTINUED An income tax charge of 1.2m 2014: 0.8m credit on other comprehensive income relates to the movement in fair valuing forward currency contracts outstanding at the year end.
No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally, where it trades and sources products, and is considered low risk by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC.
The Company is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment and reporting obligations.
In this period, the Groups contribution to the UK Exchequer from both taxes paid and collected exceeded 149.0m 2014: 157.9m with the main taxes including corporation tax 16.1m 2014: 35.4m, net VAT 53.1m 2014: 49.8m, PAYE 19.8m 2014: 17.1m, employees national insurance contributions 10.0m 2014: 8.8m, employers national insurance contributions 13.0m 2014: 11.2m and business rates 37.0m 2014: 35.6m.
DIVIDENDS 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 April 28 March 2015 2014 For the period m m Equity ordinary shares Final for the 52 weeks to 28 March 2014 paid 9.10p per share 2014: 9.10p 17.7 17.6 Interim for the 53 weeks to 3 April 2015 paid 5.50p per share 2014: 5.20p 10.7 10.1 28.4 27.7 In addition, the directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 3 April 2015 of 11.00p per share 2014: 9.10p per share, which will absorb an estimated 21.4m 2014: 17.7m of shareholders funds.
It will be paid on 28 August 2015 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 7 August 2015.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 21 and has been adjusted for the issue purchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 53 weeks to 3 April 2015.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items because it better reflects the Groups underlying performance.

ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY On 4 June 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Boardman Bikes Limited and Boardman International Limited for cash consideration of 14.7m excluding transaction costs.
The two Boardman companies retail cycles and cycle accessories under the brand name cBoardman nationally and internationally.
The purpose of this acquisition was to benefit from operating synergies.
This transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Fair value Book value adjustment Final fair value m m m Boardman net assets at the acquisition date Intangible assets 0.2 0.2 Inventories 0.7 0.7 Trade and other receivables 3.7 0.4 3.3 Cash 0.7 0.7 Trade and other payables 3.0 3.0 Current tax liabilities 0.2 0.2 Boardman net assets 2.1 0.6 1.5 GOODWILL Goodwill was recognised as a result of the acquisition as follows: m Total consideration 14.7 Less fair value of identifiable assets 1.5 Goodwill and intangible assets 13.2 Brand name intangible 3.1 Deferred tax liability 0.6 Goodwill 10.7 The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Boardman business is attributable to a operating synergies and increased control of operations, b the value of immaterial other intangible assets and c future income to be generated from new retail customer contracts and related relationships.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value adjustments relate to the best estimate of the contractual trade receivable cash flows not expected to be collected and aligning intangible asset policies with the Halfords Group.
The Boardman business contributed 2.4m revenue and a loss of 0.3m to the Groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
The Retail segment has benefited by 1.7m due to the change in royalty arrangements following acquisition.
If the acquisition of the Boardman business had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been 2.2m higher and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been 0.1m higher pre amortisation of intangible assets arising on consolidation.

Included in computer software are internally generated assets of nil 2014: 0.3m.
Product rights of 0.2m, which are fully amortised, have been included within Brand names and trademarks.
Goodwill of 253.1m 2014: 253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Retail.
Goodwill of 69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated to the Car Servicing segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing.
Goodwill of 10.7m arose on the acquisition of Boardman Bikes Limited and Boardman International Limited on 4 June 2014 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to the two Boardman entities which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units known as Boardman Bikes.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to a future income to be generated from new retail, fleet customer contracts and related relationships, b the workforce, c the value of immaterial other intangible assets and d operating synergies.
The goodwill on acquisition of the Boardman Bikes is attributable: to a operating synergies and increased control of operations: b the value of immaterial other intangible assets: and c future income to be generated from new retail customer contracts and related relationships.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations for each of the three groups of cash-generating units, being Retail, Car Servicing and Boardman Bikes.
This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Groups operating segments as reported in note 1.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration of all available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment.
The value-in-use of the goodwill held at 3 April 2015 and 28 March 2014 is driven by, and is most sensitive to, the key assumptions underlying the Group cash-generating units recoverable amounts as follows: Retail Car Servicing Note 2015 2014 2015 2014 Discount rate 1 7.3% 7.9% 8.3% 10.3% Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 1.0% 1.0% Notes: 1.
Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year budget period.
The directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a - 1.0% change in the discount rate, would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES TREASURY POLICY The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group, and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Chief Financial Officer CFO.
The CFO controls policy and performance through the line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group.
Details of the Groups current borrowing facilities are contained in note 16.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows: MARKET RISK The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk.
These are discussed further below.
Commodity risk is due to the Groups products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation.
The Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The Groups borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings i. e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates were to change by or 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease increase of 0.5m 2014: 0.6m.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES CONTINUED CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios.
These ratios are net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and fixed charge cover.
Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
The Group also uses a ratio of lease adjusted net debt to EBITDA: this is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges.
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions: Trade receivables, trade payables and finance lease obligations, The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these short-term deposits and borrowings instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long term finance lease obligations.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting date and the outright contract rate.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Cash and cash equivalents 22.4 5.3 Loans and receivables 18.4 20.6 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging assets 3.9 Total financial assets 44.7 25.9 Trade and other payables held at amortised cost 157.6 135.7 Borrowings at amortised cost 53.0 86.0 Finance leases 11.2 10.9 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging liabilities 0.1 2.1 Total financial liabilities 221.9 234.7 Trade and other payables within the scope of IAS 39 include all trade payables, all other payables and 40.1m 2014: 41.3m of accruals and deferred income.
CREDIT RISK The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was 44.7m 2014: 25.9m as detailed in the table above.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing direct-sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the trade being in US Dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 53 weeks to 3 April 2015, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 18-month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES CONTINUED The carrying amount of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows: 3 April 2015 28 March 2014 USD Other USD Other m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 6.4 1.0 0.3 0.5 Trade and other payables 19.7 0.7 19.3 13.3 0.3 19.0 0.5 The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups derivatives are denominated.
2015 2014 Increase Increase decrease in decrease in equity equity m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 13.0 9.2 10% depreciation of the US dollar 4.0 7.6 A strengthening weakening of Sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 3 April 2015 would have decreased increased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
PENSION LIABILITY RISK The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect of such a scheme.
The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be 140m of the 170m available facility, to include the Overdraft Facility of 20m.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an Acredit rating at the time of amend and extend agreement November 2014.
Ancillary business is currently being tendered with the five banks within the new banking group.
Following the completion of the amend and extend agreement, at the year-end the banks within this new group maintained a credit rating of Aor above, in line with Treasury policy.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the Group banking agent.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 12.
All trade and other payables are due within one year.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS The Group has four share award plans, all of which are equity-settled schemes: 1.
HALFORDS COMPANY SHARE OPTION SCHEME CSOS The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 3.5% per year.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
HALFORDS SHARESAVE SCHEME The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN The introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three-year period following the award date.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Companys absolute EPS performance against RPI.
The Companys TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator group.
No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte.
The Deloitte model uses the Groups share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo model.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares.
This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive remuneration.
Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2011, 2012 and 2013 under the Performance Share Plan earned final dividends of 9.1p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 4.82 per share.
Shares awarded in 2012, 2013 and 2014 under the PSP earned interim dividends of 5.5p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 4.59 per share.
Changes to the performance criteria of the PSP in relation to the awards granted during the prior year were made by the Remuneration Committee.
These changes were made in order to create better alignment with the Companys three-year strategic priorities following the Getting Into Gear programme.
The awards are weighted 25% towards Group revenue growth targets and 75% towards Group EBITDA growth targets.
The core award remains at 150% of base salary with a multiplier being introduced of 1.5x the core award if exceptional levels of performance are achieved.
The shares vesting as part of this multiplier calculation will attract a retention period of two years.
In order to focus management the awards will be underpinned by a minimum Group EBITDA, and a net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater than 1.5x throughout the three-year performance period.
CO-INVESTMENT SHARE PLAN In 2012 the Company adopted the Halfords Group plc 2012 Co-Investment Plan.
This plan was adopted for the sole purpose of making a one-off award to the Groups new CEO.
No further awards either to the Groups CEO or other executives will be made under this plan.
On 4 October 2012 the new CEO purchased 164,056 Halfords Group plc shares at a price of 302.22 pence per share and will be entitled to receive Matching Shares equivalent to a maximum of 3.5 times this investment.
Subject to continued employment these shares may vest up to a third in November 2015, up to two thirds in November 2016 and in full in November 2017, depending on the following Threshold 30% vesting and Maximum 100% vesting share price performance by Halfords: November Threshold Maximum 2015 350p 400p 2016 385p 440p 2017 425p 485p Matching Shares have been granted in the form of nil cost options, with the participant having until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant to exercise the options, and will lapse on a pro-rata basis if the required number of Investment Shares is not retained to the final vesting date.
At each relevant vesting date the participant may decide to exercise any portion of the award that has vested based on the performance at that time in which case any unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price target has not been met will lapse or roll forward that tranche in full subject to performance testing at the next vesting date.
In the latter case the participant will forfeit the right to exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at the earlier vesting date.
The Participant will be entitled to receive an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid either in cash or on a re-invested basis in shares during the period from grant to exercise in respect of the number of Matching Shares that vest.
The Barrier BlackScholes Model is an adapted BlackScholes Model and is used to calculate the estimated fair values of the Co-Investment Plan Options to include the impact of the share price based performance conditions.
Using this method the fair value of the options at the time of grant was estimated to be 1.35 per share.
The CEO left the Group on 30 April 2015 and so the share option charges made to date have been reversed.
There are currently no options in circulation in relation to this Plan.
The Group Income Statement charge recognised in respect of share-based payments for the current period is 1.4m 2014: 1.0m.
The following tables reconcile the number of share options outstanding and the weighted average exercise price WAEP for all share award plans except for the Co-Investment Plan, details of which are covered above.

PENSIONS Employees are offered membership of the Halfords Pension, which is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor independently.
The costs of contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement in the period that they arise.
The contributions to the scheme for the period amounted to 5.1m 2014: 3.6m.
In accordance with Government initiatives Halfords operates an automatic enrolment process with regards to its pension arrangements.
Employees who are aged between 22 and state pension age, earn more than 10,000 a year, and work in the UK are automatically enrolled into the Group pension arrangement.
Employees retain the right to withdraw from this pension arrangement however election of this choice must be made.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Groups banking arrangements include the facility for the bank to provide a number of guarantees in respect of liabilities owed by the Group during the course of its trading.
In the event of any amount being immediately payable under the guarantee, the bank has the right to recover the sum in full from the Group.
The total amount of guarantees in place at 3 April 2015 amounted to 3.9m 2014: 5.3m.
The Groups banking arrangements are subject to a netting facility whereby credit balances may be offset against the indebtedness of other Group companies.
Following the judgment passed by an Employment Appeal Tribunal on 4 November 2014 regarding the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay calculations, the Group has a potential liability for any claims made by employees for underpayment of holiday pay.
Given the unclear ruling regarding retrospective prospective application of the ruling and the likelihood of appeal, no charge has been made for this potential liability in the year.
Given the lack of clarity, at this moment in time no accurate estimate can be made.
