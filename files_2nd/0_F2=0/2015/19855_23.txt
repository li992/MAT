Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Section 4: Financial position Section 4 contains financial statement notes that relate to the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2015, along with the relevant accounting policies.
4.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is measured on acquisition as the excess of the aggregate of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of business combinations achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the initial amount of goodwill is negative, the amount is recognised in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
The impairment test requires the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates: this is performed with the assistance of external advisors.
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell is generally measured using an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBITA multiples obtained from comparable businesses and transactions.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a CGU level, consisting of the five business units operating across the Groups operating segments.
Not all business units are active in all segments: there are 11 CGUs at 31 December 2015 2014: 11 CGUs.
For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below.
The CGUs are individually tested for impairment each year.

The carrying amount of goodwill attributed to these CGUs at 31 December 2015 was 429.1m, 303.3m and 401.7m respectively.
In 2014, UBM Tech Events 171.7m, UBM Connect Events 125.9m, UBM EMEA Events 257.4m and Advanstar Events 313.5m were considered significant.
The UBM Americas Print CGU has been impaired by 1.9m during the year ended 31 December 2015, following product rationalisation affecting the print business.

Impairment tests for goodwill For the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, the carrying amount of each CGU excluding PRN in 2015 has been compared with its estimated value in use.
The classification of the PR Newswire businesses as held for sale is detailed in Section 1.
As the estimated sale proceeds, exceed the carrying value of the net assets held for sale see Note 6.4, no impairment was necessary.
The following key assumptions were used by management in the value in use calculations: Pre-tax Perpetuity discount growth rate rate % % Cash flow forecasts Events 2015: 12.0 14.0 2015: 1.8 2.5 Event revenue is expected to continue to grow with continued focus 2014: 13.4 14.7 2014: 1.7 2.5 on Events First strategy and organic growth in major events Marketing Services Online 2015: 12.0 14.0 2015: 1.5 2.4 The continued rebalancing of the product portfolio, away from print 2014: 12.9 14.7 2014: 1.6 2.0 to digital Focus on cost reduction through efficiency optimisation Marketing Services Print 2015: 12.0 14.0 2015: 0 1.5 Continued rationalisation and optimisation of the print portfolio with 2014: 13.5 2014: 1.6 further non-core titles either closed or sold, expected to result in stabilisation of print margins PR Newswire 2015: n a 2015: n a Continued steady growth of the core wire distribution, engagement and 2014: 14.4 2014: 1.6 workflow data businesses Forecast cash flows For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first five years are based on the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management.
The forecast cash flows, budgets and forecasts are based on assumptions that reflect past experience, long-term trends, industry forecasts and growth rates and management estimates see above.
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows beyond the first five years are based upon the weighted average projected real gross domestic product growth rate in 2020 of each of the territories in which the CGUs operate 2014: 2019.
Growth rates for each territory have been weighted based on contribution to 2016 budgeted revenue 2014: contribution to 2015 budgeted revenue.
The growth rates used in the value in use calculation range from 0% to 2.5% 2014: 1.6% to 2.5% depending on the territories and industries in which each CGU operates.
Discount rate The discount rate for each CGU is based on the risk-free rate for long-term government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities, the systemic risk of the specific CGU and taking into account the relative size of the CGU and the specific territories in which it operates.
The increased risk of investing in equities is assessed using an equity market risk premium which reflects the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the whole market.
The equity market risk premium used is based on studies by independent economists and historical equity market risk premiums.
The risk adjustment for the systematic risk, beta, of the CGU reflects the risks specific to the CGU for which the forecast cash flows have not been adjusted.
The adjustment to the rate has been determined by management using an average of the betas of comparable companies within respective sectors.
112 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 4.1 Goodwill continued Sensitivities Following the charge for impairment, the estimated recoverable amount of the UBM Americas Print 2014: UBM Tech Online CGU is equal to the carrying value at 31 December 2015.
Consequently, any adverse change in key assumption would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss of other assets to be recognised.
Management believes that no reasonable change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU, other than UBM Americas Print 2014: UBM Tech Online, to exceed its recoverable amount.
4.2 Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets acquired separately including website development costs relating to the application and infrastructure development, graphical design and content development stages incurred with third parties are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised in accordance with the accounting policy for acquisitions Note 6.1 and measured on initial recognition at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Internally generated intangible assets, including internally generated software, that do not qualify for recognition as an intangible asset under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense.
All research costs are expensed as incurred.
At each reporting date, intangible assets are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives as follows: Trademarks brands 10-15 years Software 5-7 years Customer contracts and relationships 1-10 years Subscription lists 2-5 years Databases 2-10 years Website development costs 3 years Useful lives are re-examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The amortisation of internally generated or purchased software and website development costs is included in operating expenses in the income statement.
The amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions is included as a separate line item in the income statement as it does not relate to operating activities.

For all other intangible assets, the average remaining useful lives for the brands and customer contracts and relationships intangible assets is 7 years and 3 years respectively 2014: 7 years and 3 years respectively.
The average remaining useful lives for the other classes of intangible assets is 6 years 2014: 11 years.
4.3 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all items except freehold land.
Depreciation rates are calculated so that assets are written down to the residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease General plant, machinery and equipment 5-20 years Computer equipment 3-5 years Motor vehicles 3-5 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the item is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

On 30 June 2015, the Group acquired the remaining 60% shareholding of eMedia Asia Limited.
The previous 40% joint venture shareholding was impaired by 6.2m to a fair value of 3.8m which is treated as a disposal in the step acquisition accounting Note 6.1.
The 6.2m impairment is offset by 2.0m of cumulative exchange gains reclassified to profit and loss on disposal Note 3.5.
The addition in 2014 relates to the fair value of the 34% equity interest in Light Reading.
The Group previously owned 100% of Light Reading but disposed of 66% as detailed in Note 6.3, which has resulted in the reclassification of the investment from a subsidiary to an associate.

1 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are measured at invoice amount less a provision for impairment.
A provision is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Trade receivables debts are written off when there is no expectation of recovery.

See Note 5.7 on credit risk of trade receivables, which explains how the Group manages and measures credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired.
2 Vendor Loan Notes Delta vendor loan note The Delta vendor loan note was repaid in full in October 2015.
The cash inflow from principal repayments of 21.8m has been reported within cash flows from investing activities 2014: 16.1m.
At 31 December 2014, the loan note was carried at 24.8m.
Light Reading vendor loan note The Light Reading vendor loan note is split between Tranche A and Tranche B loan amounts.
Tranche A accrues an annual interest coupon of 12% plus 3 month LIBOR, and Tranche B accrues an annual interest coupon of 5.5% plus 3 month LIBOR.
As at 31 December 2015, the balance on the Light Reading vendor loan note was 7.8m of which 5.5m is reported as non-current 2014: 7.4m of which 6.8m was non-current.
3 Trade and other payables Accounting policy Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
Trade and other payables are measured at original cost, which approximates to their fair value.

If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Management reassesses the amounts of these provisions at each balance sheet date in order to ensure that they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimates is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

The amounts recorded in the above tables are continually evaluated by management.
Reorganisation and restructuring The provision relates to the remaining costs to be incurred in relation to the restructuring of the UBM Americas business, severance relating to the Advanstar integration and the onerous contract with the Excel London Exhibition and Convention Centre.
These contracts entail minimum commitments for space rentals in excess of those foreseen to be necessary which exceed the economic benefits expected to be received and have therefore been designated as onerous contracts.
These provisions will be utilised over the next 12 months.
Vacant properties The provisions relate to obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property.
The quantification of the provisions depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties.
The provisions also relate to obligations in respect of dilapidations on leasehold properties.
The quantification of these provisions are dependent on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.

The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital.
Liabilities relating to disposals The provisions relate to obligations arising from warranty and other claims brought against the Group in relation to disposed businesses over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal.

On 12 May 2014, AXIO Data Group Holdings Limited AXIO, the purchaser of the Delta Businesses, issued a claim in the High Court of England and Wales against UBM, alleging various breaches of warranties contained in the relevant sale agreement.
AXIO claims that it has suffered losses, in an amount of 17m, and seeks to recover this sum, together with interest and costs.
UBM intends to contest the claim vigorously and on 6 June 2014 filed its defence denying the claim in its entirety.
The trial is scheduled to take place in March 2016.
UBM does not believe that this claim or any resolution thereof will have a significant effect on UBM and or the Groups financial position or profitability.
