48 Pension obligations a Introduction The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, Ireland, and Canada with the main UK scheme being the largest.
The assets and liabilities of these defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2015 are shown below.

The smaller ones, while still measured under IAS 19, are included as one total within Provisions see note 47.
Similarly, while the charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section b i below, the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section d below.
The assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long-term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.

All schemes are closed to future accrual.
Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with additional future accrual for active members.
i UK schemes In the UK, the Group operates three main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS, the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011 and the Friends Provident Pension Scheme FPPS which was acquired during the year as part of the Friends Life acquisition.
As the defined benefit section of the UK schemes is now closed to both new members and future accrual, existing deferred members in active service and new entrants participate in the defined contribution section of the ASPS.
The UK schemes operate within the UK pensions regulatory framework.
ii Other schemes Future accruals for the Irish and Canadian defined benefit schemes ceased with effect from 30 April 2013 and 31 December 2011 respectively.
The Irish scheme is regulated by the Pensions Authority in Ireland.
The main Canadian plan is Registered Pension Plan in Canada and as such is registered with the Canada Revenue Agency and Financial Services Commission of Ontario and is required to comply with the Income Tax of Canada and the various provincial Pension Acts within Canada.
b IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, Ireland and Canada, are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.

2 Net interest income of 105 million has been credited to investment income and net interest expense of 25 million has been charged to finance costs see Note 7.
3 The gross surplus of 68 million on acquisition relates to the FPPS.
As the FPPS assets include an insurance policy of 631 million at acquisition date, issued by a Group company that is not transferable under IAS 19, it is eliminated from the scheme assets.
The present value of unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations included in the table above is 111 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 120 million.
222 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 222 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 IFRS Financial statements 48 Pension obligations continued The net surplus at 31 December 2015 includes FPPS following the acquisition of Friends Life.
Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income reflect reduced asset values driven by a rise in interest rates in the UK partly offset by a decrease in the defined benefit obligation due to an increase in the UK discount rate.
These impacts were offset in the net surplus by employer contributions.

2 FPPS assets are included in the UK balances.
As at 31 December 2015, the FPPSs cash and other balances includes an insurance policy of 546 million issued by a Group company that is not transferable under IAS 19 and is consequently eliminated from the Groups IAS 19 scheme assets.

Where the investment and insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in Cash and other.
iii Assumptions on scheme liabilities The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2015.
The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
Financial assumptions The main financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Ireland Canada 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 1 Inflation rate 3.15% 2.05% 3.1% 2.0% 1.6% 1.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2 General salary increases 4.95% 4.9% 3.1% 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 3 Pension increases 3.15% 2.05% 3.1% 2.0% 0.4% 0.4% 1.25% 1.25% 3 Deferred pension increases 3.15% 2.05% 3.1% 2.0% 1.6% 1.5% 4 Discount rate 3.75% 3.7% 2.3% 2.1% 3.75% 4.0% 3.6% pensioners 3.8% deferred Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds 1 For the UK schemes, assumptions provided for RPI CPI.
In the UK, the assumptions for the ASPS and RAC schemes are the single rates for RPI CPI: for FPPS, relevant RPI CPI swap curves are used, which are broadly equivalent to these single rates.
2 In the UK, the only remaining linkage between pension benefits and general salary increases is in respect of a small amount of Guaranteed Minimum Pension benefits, in line with National Average Earnings.
3 For the UK schemes, assumptions provided for RPI CPI.
In the UK, the assumptions for the ASPS and RAC schemes are single rates for RPI CPI: for FPPS, relevant RPI CPI swap curves are used, which are broadly equivalent to these single rates.
The assumptions are also adjusted to reflect the relevant caps floors and the inflation volatility.
4 To calculate scheme liabilities in the UK, a single discount rate is used in ASPS RAC, whereas in FPPS, separate discount rates are used for the defined benefit obligation for pensioners and deferred.
The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
224 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 224 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 IFRS Financial statements 48 Pension obligations continued Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2015 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger Currently younger Mortality table age NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA UK ASPS Club Vita pooled experience, including an allowance for future improvements 60 89.8 91.7 90.8 92.6 29.8 31.7 30.8 32.6 RAC SAPS, including allowances for future improvement 65 87.5 90.1 89.3 91.6 22.5 25.1 24.3 26.6 FPPS SAPS, including allowances for future improvement 60 88.6 90.2 89.6 91.9 28.6 30.2 29.6 31.9 Ireland 89% PNA00 with allowance for future improvements 61 88.0 91.3 90.9 94.1 27.0 30.3 29.9 33.1 Canada Canadian Pensioners Mortality 2014 Private Table 65 86.5 87.6 89.0 90.0 21.5 22.6 24.0 25.0 The assumptions above are based on commonly used mortality tables.
The tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In ASPS, which is the most material to the Group, the allowance for mortality improvement is per the actuarial professions CMI 2013 model, with assumed long-term rates of improvement of 1.75% p. a. for males, and 1.50% p. a. for females.
Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and mortality.
The sensitivities analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant.
The following table summarises how the defined benefit obligation would have increased decreased as a result of the change in the respective assumptions: Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation Increase in Decrease in Increase in Decrease in discount rate discount rate inflation rate inflation rate 1 year 1 1% -1% 1% -1% younger m m m m m Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2015 2,398 3,112 2,592 2,064 396 Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2014 2,170 2,911 2,747 2,081 367 1 The effect of assuming all members in the schemes were one year younger.
The sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative as in practice it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised within the consolidated statement of financial position.
In addition, the sensitivities shown are for liabilities only and ignore the impact on assets, which would significantly mitigate the net interest rate and inflation sensitivity impact on the net surplus.
Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligation The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 19 years in ASPS, 21 years in FPPS, 19 years in the RAC scheme, 19 years in the Irish scheme and 12 years in the Canadian scheme.
The expected undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme, ASPS, is shown in the chart below: Undiscounted benefit payments m Deferred member cash ows Pensioner cash ows 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2015 2045 2075 2105 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 225 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 | 225 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 48 Pension obligations continued iv Risk management and asset allocation strategy As noted above, the long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long-term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
To meet these objectives, the schemes assets are invested in a portfolio, consisting primarily approximately 75% of debt securities as detailed in section b ii.
The investment strategy will continue to evolve over time and is expected to match the liability profile increasingly closely with swap overlays to improve interest rate and inflation matching.
The schemes are generally matched to interest rate risk relative to the funding basis.
Main UK scheme The Company works closely with the trustee, who is required to consult it on the investment strategy.
Interest rate and inflation risks are managed using a combination of liability-matching assets and swaps.
Exposure to equity risk has been reducing over time and credit risk is managed within risk appetite.
Currency risk is relatively small and is largely hedged.
The other principal risk is longevity risk.
In 2014, ASPS entered into a longevity swap covering approximately 5 billion of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.
During the year, the RAC pension scheme entered into a longevity swap covering approximately 600 million of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.
v Funding Formal actuarial valuations normally take place every three years and where there is a deficit, the Company and the trustee would agree a deficit recovery plan.
The assumptions adopted for triennial actuarial valuations are determined by the trustee and agreed with the Company and are normally more prudent than the assumptions adopted for IAS19 purposes, which are best estimate.
For ASPS, following the latest formal actuarial valuation with an effective date of 31 March 2012 a deficit recovery plan was agreed, to make good the deficit over a period of time, consistent with the requirements of the UK pension regulations.
As at 31 December 2015, the ASPS was fully funded.
The Company is currently undergoing a triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2015.
Total employer contributions for all schemes in 2016 are currently expected to be 130 million.
c Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
Members of this section contribute at least 2% of their pensionable salaries and, depending on the percentage chosen, the Company contributes up to a maximum 14%, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2016.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution schemes is shown section d below.
d Charge to staff costs in the income statement The total pension charge to staff costs for all of the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2015 2014 m m Continuing operations UK defined benefit schemes 12 31 Overseas defined benefit schemes 1 1 Total defined benefit schemes note 10b 13 30 UK defined contribution schemes 108 94 Overseas defined contribution schemes 15 16 Total defined contribution schemes note 10b 123 110 Total charge for pension schemes 136 140 There were no significant contributions payable or prepaid in the consolidated statement of financial position as at either 31 December 2015 or 2014.
