S STR TRA ATE TEG GI IC C R RE EP PO OR RT T G GO OVE VER RNAN NANC CE E F FI INAN NANC CI IAL ALS S Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES General information Card Factory plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered office is Century House, Brunel Road, 41 Industrial Estate, Wakefield WF2 0XG.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as theGroup.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU EU IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under EU IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified for the subsequent measurement of derivative financial instruments and deferred contingent consideration at fair value.
Impact of the Group restructure prior to the Initial Public Offering On 20 May 2014, Card Factory plc was admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
In preparation for the Initial Public Offering, the Group was restructured.
On 30 April 2014 Card Factory plc formerly CF Listco Limited, incorporated on 17 April 2014 for the purpose of the restructure acquired 100% of the share capital of CF Topco Limited in a share for share exchange, thereby inserting Card Factory plc as the Parent Company of the Group.
The shareholders of CF Topco Limited became 100% owners of the enlarged share capital of Card Factory plc.
These are the first set of consolidated financial statements of Card Factory plc.
By applying the principles of reverse acquisition accounting, the Group financial statements are presented as if Card Factory plc had always owned CF Topco Limited.
Comparative figures for the year ended 31 January 2014 are the consolidated results of CF Topco Limited, adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium and merger reserve of Card Factory plc at the point of the restructure, thereby creating a reverse acquisition reserve.
The statutory accounts of CF Topco Limited for the year ended 31 January 2014 were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
The historical financial information published in the initial public offering prospectus IPO prospectus, dated 15 May 2014, presents the consolidated financial statements of CF Topco Limited for the years ended 31January 2014, 31 January 2013 and 31 January 2012, prepared in accordance with EU IFRS and applying IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The historical financial information published in the IPO prospectus includes details of the transition, reconciling UK GAAP to EU IFRS.
Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU IFRS requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Areas subject to significant judgement, assumption or estimation are detailed below: IPO transactions Classification of costs incurred in relation to the IPO is subject to judgement in determining the value of costs attributable to the issue of new share capital recognised as share issue costs within share premium and the value of costs attributable to the sale of existing shares expensed to the income statement.
Inventory provisions The Group provides against the carrying value of inventories where it is anticipated that net realisable value NRV will be below cost.
NRV of aged inventory is assessed based on historical experience.
Goodwill impairment Goodwill is assessed for impairment based on the recoverable amount of the cash generating units CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are based on a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions in the calculation are disclosed in note 11.

The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Information regarding the Groups business activities and factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 29.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 16 to 19.
In addition, notes 23 and 24 to the financial statements include the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards effective in the year The following new and amended standards, adopted in the current financial year, had no significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 2011 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 2011 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting Amendments to IAS 39 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Amendments to IAS 36 IFRIC 21 Levies Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 IFRS 10 replaces those parts of IAS 27 that relate to consolidated financial statements and along with IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 forms a new suite of consolidation standards.
The accounting policy for consolidation of subsidiaries has been revised to reflect the definition of control within IFRS 10.
All entities within the Group are 100% owned and not subject to any contractual arrangements that might otherwise impact control of the entity.
Consequently the new standards and the revised accounting policy do not impact the financial statements.
EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards in issue but not yet effective The Directors considered the impact on the Group of EU endorsed, new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments.
The following revised accounting standards are currently endorsed but effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014.
None are expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Amendments toIAS 19 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 2012 cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011 2013 cycle New standards and amendments awaiting EU endorsement are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to direct the activities that affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated upon consolidation.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Acquisitions prior to 1 February 2011 date of transition to IFRS IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
The Group and Company elected not to restate business combinations that took place prior to 1 February 2011.
In respect of acquisitions prior to the transition date, goodwill is included at 1 February 2011 on the basis of its deemed cost at that date, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP.
Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods sold to customers and is stated net of value added tax and returns.
Revenue is recognised at the point goods are sold or delivered and the risks and rewards are deemed to have been transferred to the customer.
Revenue is attributable to the retail sale of cards, dressings and gifts in the UK.
Financing income and expense Finance expense comprises interest charges and losses on interest rate derivative financial instruments.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Finance income comprises interest income and gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments.
Interest income and interest charges are recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method takes into account fees, commissions or other incremental transaction costs integral to the yield.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and all subsidiary entities.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
All foreign currency transactions relate to inventory purchases.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement within cost of sales, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or through other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Underlying profit and earnings The Group has chosen to present an underlying profit and earnings measure.
The Group believes that underlying profit and earnings provides additional useful information for shareholders.
Underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under EU IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures reported by other companies.
The reported non-underlying adjustments are as follows: Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on derivative financial instruments The Group utilises foreign currency derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on US Dollar denominated purchases and interest rate derivative contracts to manage the risk on floating interest rate bank borrowings.
Fair value gains and losses on such instruments are recognised in the income statement to the extent they are not hedge accounted under IAS 39.
Such gains and losses relate to future cash flows.
In accordance with the commercial reasoning for entering into these agreements, the gains losses are deemed not representative of the underlying financial performance in the year and presented as non-underlying items.
Any gains or losses on maturity of such instruments are presented within underlying profit to the extent the gain or loss is not recognised in the hedging reserve.
IPO costs In May 2014, Card Factory plc floated on the London Stock Exchange.
Non-recurring IPO related costs totalled 5.3 million of which 3.8 million was charged to the income statement and 1.5 million was recognised within share premium as costs directly related to the issue of new shares.
Residual management equity share based payment On admission to the London Stock Exchange, shares with a fair value of 9.8 million were issued at nominal value in relation to residual management equity as detailed in the IPO prospectus.
Employer national insurance of 1.4 million was incurred on the issue of the shares.
These non-recurring share based payments are presented as a non-underlying item in the income statement.
Refinanced debt issue cost amortisation Debt issue costs not yet amortised totalling 7.7 million were expensed to the income statement when the related bank borrowings were repaid and refinanced on 30 May 2014.
See note 21 for details of net debt movements.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved such that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend.
Financial instruments Financial assets The Group classifies all its non-derivative financial assets as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Group has no intention of trading these loans and receivables.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value less transaction costs, these assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to impairment.
Derivative financial assets are categorised as fair value through profit or loss FVTPL and classified as held for trading, unless accounted for as an effective hedging instrument.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives and contingent consideration.
Derivatives are categorised as FVTPL and classified as held for trading, unless accounted for as an effective hedging instrument.
Contingent consideration on business combinations is designated as FVTPL.

Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, at bank and on short term deposit of less than three months.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for objective evidence of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists, impairment provisions are made to reduce the carrying value of financial assets to the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises foreign currency derivative contracts and US Dollar denominated cash balances to manage the foreign exchange risk on US Dollar denominated purchases and interest rate derivative contracts to manage the risk on floating interest rate bank borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately within profit or loss except to the extent the instrument has been designated an effective hedging arrangement.
Gains and losses in respect of foreign currency derivative contracts are recognised within cost of sales.
Gains and losses in respect of interest rate derivative contracts are recognised within finance income or expense.
Cash flow hedges In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, derivative financial instruments are eligible for cash flow hedge accounting where the following conditions are met: at the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entitys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge: the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the originally documented risk management strategy: the forecast transaction that is the subject of the hedge is highly probable and presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss: the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured: and the hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined actually to have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Foreign currency cash held in the short period between derivative maturity and payment of the hedged cash flow is designated as part of the hedging relationship whereby gains and losses on retranslation of the foreign currency cash are recognised in the hedging reserve.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in OCI and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Fair value estimation The techniques applied in determining the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 24.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows: buildings 25 50 years leasehold improvements shorter of 5 years and lease term plant and equipment 3 10 years fixtures and fittings 5 years motor vehicles 4 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Software Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Costs relating to development of computer software are capitalised if the recognition criteria of IAS38 Intangible Assets are met or expensed as incurred otherwise.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense asincurred.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful life of software is 3-5 years.
Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying values of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment where there is an indication of impairment.
If an impairment loss arises, the asset value is adjusted to its estimated recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the balance sheet date and whenever an indication of impairment is identified.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Merger reserve On 30 April 2014 Card Factory plc acquired 100% of the share capital of CF Topco Limited in a share for share exchange, thereby inserting Card Factory plc as the Parent Company of the Group.
The premium arising on the issue of shares is recognised in the merger reserve.
Share based payments The Company issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees.
The cost of equity-settled share awards is measured as the fair value of the award at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model.
The cost of the awards is expensed to the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The total income statement charge is based on the Groups estimate of the number of share awards that will eventually vest in accordance with the vesting conditions.
The awards do not include market-based vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
Any revision to estimates is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense.
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group has two operating segments trading under the names Card Factory and Getting Personal.
Card Factory retails greeting cards, dressing and gifts in the UK through an extensive store network.
Getting Personal is an online retailer of personalised cards and gifts.
Getting Personal does not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment as defined in IFRS 8.
Consequently the results of the Group are presented as a single reportable segment.
Revenues outside of the UK are not significant at less than 0.1 million.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors.
Internal management reports are reviewed by the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.
Performance of segments is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs including EBITDA as defined in note 5 of the financial statements and profit before tax.
Major customers Group revenue is derived from high volume, low value retail sales and is therefore not dependent on any major customer.

Shareholder loan notes were part repaid in October 2013 and the remaining balance settledby share exchange in May 2014 prior to the IPO.
Furthermore, under a new thin capitalisation agreement approved in the year, shareholder loan note interest for the period October 2013 to May 2014 is now fully deductible giving rise to a 0.7 million non-underlying current period tax credit on interest accrued to 31January2014.
9 DIVIDENDS The Board is recommending a total dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 January 2015 of 6.8 pence per share, resulting in a total dividend of 23.2 million.
The total dividend comprises an interim dividend which the Directors are declaring of 2.3 pence per share and a proposed final dividend of 4.5 pence per share.
The final dividend will, subject to shareholders approval at the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2015, be paid alongside the interim dividend on 5 June 2015 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 1 May 2015.
No liability is recorded in the financial statements in respect of the dividends as they were not approved at the balancesheet date.
No dividends have been paid in the year 2014: nil.
10 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares for the prior period reflects the weighted average number of ordinary shares of CF Topco Limited, multiplied for a 1:50 share split effected on the reverse acquisition see note 1 for details of the reverse acquisition.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue for the period, adjusted forthe dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares represent share incentive awards granted to employees in the period.

Value-in-use calculations are based on 5 year management forecasts and operating cash flows with a 2% terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long-term growth rate of the sector.
The key assumptions on which operating cash flows are based include sales growth and operating costs.

The principal financial risks and uncertainties and the actions taken to mitigate them are reviewed on an on-going basis.
Further details of the Groups approach to managing risk are included in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report on pages 20 to 25 and in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 34 to 42.
Liquidity risk The Group generates significant operational cash inflows enabling the Group to maintain substantial cash balances.
The Group also has a 20.0 million revolving credit facility to meet seasonal short term liquidity requirements.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
Long-term bank funding is subject to certain agreed financial covenants.
The risk of a breach of these covenants is mitigated by regular financial forecasting, detailed covenant modelling and monitoring of covenant compliance.
As at 31 January 2015, the Group had adequate headroom against all of its financial covenants.
Further details on Group borrowings are set out in note 17 of the financial statements.

To mitigate the risk, counterparties are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions and exposures are monitored on a monthly basis.
Group policy limits credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents with any single approved counterparty to 40.0 million.
The Group is also exposed to counterparty credit risk in relation to payments in advance of goods to overseas suppliers.
At 31 January 2015 this exposure amounted to 2.7 million 2014: 2.7 million.
The Group utilises letters of credit for certain overseas suppliers, thereby reducing the total exposure to advance payments.
As a retail business the Group has minimal exposure to credit risk on trade receivables.
Capital management The Groups capital risk management policy is to maintain a capital structure that is conservative yet efficient in terms of providing long-term returns to shareholders.
The Group defines capital as equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent plus net debt.
The Group has a continued focus on free cash flow generation.
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics together with banking covenant ratios, maintaining suitable headroom to ensure that the Groups financing requirements continue to be serviceable.
