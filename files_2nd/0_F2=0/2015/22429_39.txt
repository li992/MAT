The City of London Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures The Directors manage investment risk principally through setting an investment policy that is approved by shareholders which incorporates risk parameters see page 4, by contracting management of the Companys investments to an investment manager Henderson under a contract which incorporates appropriate duties and restrictions and by monitoring performance in relation to these.
The Boards relationship with Henderson is discussed on page 30.
Internal control and the Boards approach to risk is on page 29.
There have been no material changes to the management or nature of the Companys investment risks from the prior year.
The main risks arising from the Companys pursuit of its investment objective are market risk comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk.
The effects of these can also be increased by gearing.
The Board and Henderson coordinate the Companys risk management and there are various risk management systems in place as detailed below.
Straight-through processing via a deal order and management system OMS is utilised for listed securities Portfolio modelling and investment management functions including order-raising, dealing and trade execution are performed using one of, or a combination of, the following third-party software applications: Charles River Development OMS and or Imagine.
Fund pricing and accounting services are outsourced to a third-party administrator currently BNP Paribas Securities Services which utilises Hiportfolio software.
The IT tools to which the Henderson risk, compliance and operations teams have access for independent monitoring and risk measurement purposes include: Charles River Compliance module for investment restrictions monitoring: ArcLogics operational risk database: RiskMetrics, UBS Delta, Style Research, Finanalytica and Barra Aegis for market risk measurement: Bloomberg for market data and price-checking: and Hiportfolio for portfolio holdings and valuations.
16.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises market price risk see note 16.1.
2 and interest rate risk see note 16.1.
The Fund Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of investments.
The Companys investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about the future prices of the investments.
Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from Henderson.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors Hendersons compliance with the Companys objectives, including investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Company may buy sell put or call options or futures on indices and on equity investments in its portfolio to manage its exposure to price risk or to generate income.
At 30 June 2015 the Company had no open positions 2014: nil.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 14 and 15.
This shows that the majority of the Companys investments are in UK listed companies.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to the UK, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The sensitivity of a the return after taxation for the year and b the Companys net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair values of the Companys investments at each balance sheet date is shown below.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible, based on observation of current market conditions.
The impact of a 10% increase in the value of the investments on the revenue return as at 30 June 2015 is a decrease of 132,000 2014: 121,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 125,623,000 2014: 114,866,000.
The total impact on equity shareholders funds would be an increase of 125,491,000 2014: 114,745,000.

2 Currency risk The Company is not itself materially exposed to currency risk, although some of the investments will be in companies that have operations that involve currency risk and pay dividends in foreign currencies.
Management of the risk Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
However, the Company does sometimes hedge foreign currency exposure ahead ofthe declaration of dividends from companies in which it invests.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30 June 2015 are 445,000 2014:350,000.
Foreign currency sensitivity The Companys sensitivity to movements in exchange rates affecting its investment income, assuming a 10% movement in the Sterling US Dollar rate, will be a loss of 1,046,000 2014: 873,000 if Sterling strengthens and a profit of 1,278,000 2014:1,067,000 if Sterling weakens.
The 10% movement has been based on average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the level of income receivable from cash at bank and on deposit.
the interest payable on the Companys variable rate bank borrowings.
Management of the risk The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings atlevels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts have not been used during the year to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.

The exposure to floating interest rates can be found on the balance sheet under cash at bank and under bank overdraft in note 14.

52 The City of London Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets is in investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
For details of the Companys bank borrowing facility, see note 14.
The Board gives guidance to Henderson as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings should be used to fund short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 30 June 2015, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, is given on page 50.
16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant and is managed as follows: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit rating is reviewed regularly by Henderson and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Stock lending is the temporary transfer of securities by a lender to a borrower, with an agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities to the lender at an agreed future date.
Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower, which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Details of the value of securities on loan at the year end, and the collateral held, can be found in note 4.
In summary the Company only transacts with counterparties that it considers to be credit worthy.
None of the Companys financial assets are past their due date or impaired.
16.4 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value or the balance sheet amount is areasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
At 30 June 2015 the aggregate fair value of the debenture stocks and secured notes was 84,450,000 2014:90,188,000 and the aggregate fair value of the preferred and preference stock was 2,685,000 2014: 2,622,000.
These valuations are obtained from brokers based on market prices.
The debenture stock, preference stock and preferred ordinary stock are carried in the balance sheet at par.
53 The City of London Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the FRS 29 fair value hierarchy.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss at 30 June 2015 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 1,259,315 347 1,259,662 Total 1,259,315 347 1,259,662 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss at 30 June 2014 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 1,151,477 347 1,151,824 Total 1,151,477 347 1,151,824 The total carrying value of loans and receivables, as stated in note 13, is a reasonable approximation of their fair value as at the year end date.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note on page 42.
There have not been any transfers during the year between any of the levels.
A reconciliation of fair value movements within Level 3 is set out below.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets 000 Opening and closing fair value 347 16.6 Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, and to provide long-term growth in income and capital, principally by investment in UK equities.

These are measured in accordance with the policies used in the annual financial statements The Company has complied with these requirements.
Other than in exceptional market conditions, gearing will not exceed 20% of the net asset value at the time of draw down of the relevant borrowings.
