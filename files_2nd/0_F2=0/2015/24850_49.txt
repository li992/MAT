CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Company's accounting policies, which are described on page 51 and in Note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Company's accounting policies The following are the critical judgements and estimates that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
Fair Value hierarchy classification In determining the level within the fair value hierarchy, set out in IFRS 13, the Directors consider whether inputs to a fair value measurement are observable, and significant to its measurement.
This requires judgement based on the facts and circumstances around the published NAV of the underlying funds.
The Directors consider the availability of the NAV, at the reporting date, and whether holdings would be redeemable at such a NAV with evidence of redemptions at reporting date.
They also consider whether unobservable adjustments, such as liquidity discounts, have been made by the Company.
In the event there is any change in the above factors, a transfer between fair value hierarchy will be deemed to have occurred and would be disclosed in Note 7.
