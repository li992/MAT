84 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2015 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 3 Segment Information Imperial Tobacco comprises two distinct businesses Tobacco and Logistics.
The Tobacco business comprises the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products, including sales to but not by the Logistics business.
The Logistics business comprises the distribution of tobacco products for tobacco product manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco, as well as a wide range of non-tobacco products and services.
The Logistics business is run on an operationally neutral basis ensuring all customers are treated equally, and consequently transactions between the Tobacco and Logistics businesses are undertaken on an arms length basis reflecting market prices for comparable goods and services.
The Tobacco business is managed based on the strategic role of groups of markets rather than their geographic proximity, with divisions focused on prioritising growth or returns.
Returns Markets are typically mature markets where we have relatively large market shares and our objective is to maximise returns over the long term by growing profits while actively managing market share.
Growth Markets are mainly large profit or volume pools where we typically have market shares below 15 per cent and where our total tobacco approach provides many opportunities for share and profit growth both now and in the future.
Following the 2015 acquisition, the USA has become a significant market and is therefore disclosed separately.
The function of Chief Operating Decision Maker defined in IFRS 8, which is to review performance and allocate resources, is performed by the Board and the Chief Executive, who are regularly provided with information on our segments.
This information is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures provided below.

10 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held to satisfy the Groups employee share schemes and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if rights held under the employee share schemes were exercised.
No instruments have been excluded from the calculation for any period on the grounds that they are anti-dilutive.

In November 2013, the Group acquired e-vapour intellectual property rights from the Hong Kong based company Dragonite for 46 million.
Intangible amortisation and impairment are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of intangible assets other than software are treated as reconciling items between reported operating profit and adjusted operating profit.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2015 91 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 11 Intangible Assets continued Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
For the Tobacco business CGUs are based on the markets where the business operates and are grouped in line with the divisional structure in operation during the year.
The groupings represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is set out below.

The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The value of a CGU, or group of CGUs as appropriate, is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections derived from three year financial plans which are approved by the Board annually and are based on detailed bottom-up market-by-market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line.
These forecasts reflect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, consumer uptrading and downtrading, consumer preferences and other changes in product mix, based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost inflation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
Growth rates and discount rates used The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
2015 Pre-tax Initial growth Long-term % discount rate rate growth rate Returns Markets North 9.0 2.6 1.8 Returns Markets South 11.3 0.8 1.8 Growth Markets 8.9-16.7 5.4-13.5 1.8-4.0 USA 10.0 3.5 2.5 Logistics 9.6 8.0 1.8 Cash flows from the three year plan period are extrapolated out to year five using the growth rate implicit in the three year plan, shown in the table above as the initial growth rate.
Estimated long-term weighted average compound annual growth rates of between 1.8 per cent and 4.0 per cent per annum are used beyond year five.
Long-term growth rates are based on managements long-term expectations, taking account of industry specific factors such as the nature of our products, the role of excise in government fiscal policy, and relatively stable and predictable long-term macro trends in the tobacco industry.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the CGUs.
Our impairment projections are prepared under the basis set out in IAS 36 which can differ from our internal plans.
Growth markets Within our Growth Markets reporting segment, there are a number of CGU groupings based on our operating segments, including Drive Growth and Other Premium Cigar.
The Drive Growth CGU grouping includes our markets in Russia, Italy and Japan.
The major market in this CGU grouping is Russia.
Our impairment test for this CGU grouping indicated headroom of 69 million, and assumed a compound annual growth rate for Russia over the first five years of 11.4 per cent.
The test also assumed a discount rate for the Russian market of 16.7 per cent reflecting recent political uncertainty and a long-term growth rate of 3.0 per cent.
A reduction of 12 per cent in overall forecast cash flows, or an increase in the discount rate by 190 basis points, or a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 310 basis points, or a further 14 per cent devaluation of the Russian rouble would cause the carrying value to equal the recoverable amount.
The impairment test for our Other Premium Cigar CGU grouping that includes our non-Cuban Premium Cigar business indicated headroom of 17 million.
A reduction in overall forecast cash flows of 3 per cent, or an increase in the discount rate by 20 basis points from 10.0 per cent, or a reduction in the short-term growth rate of 70 basis points from 5.4 per cent, or a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 30 basis points from 2.2 per cent would cause the carrying value to equal the recoverable amount.
Other CGU groupings For the rest of the Group, any reasonable movement in the assumptions used in the impairment tests would not result in an impairment.

This note explains the Groups exposure to these risks, how they are measured and assessed, and summarises the policies and processes used to manage them, including those related to the management of capital.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of the Groups strategic objectives, specifically its exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty credit risk.
The Group operates on a global basis and manages its capital to ensure that subsidiaries are able to operate as going concerns and to optimise returns to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The Groups Treasury activities are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee GTC, which meets regularly throughout the year and comprises the Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary and other senior management from Group Finance, Manufacturing and Group Treasury.
The GTC operates in accordance with the terms of reference set out by the Board and a framework the GTC framework which sets out the expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, and to the GTC on a monthly basis.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions and Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2015 97 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 19 Financial Risk Factors continued The Groups management of market, credit and liquidity risk is as follows: Market risk Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk other than assets held by its pension funds disclosed in note 22.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Currently, these techniques reduce the expected exposure to this risk over the short to medium term to levels considered not material and accordingly, no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, as well as the translation of cash investments, borrowings and derivatives held in non-functional currencies.
The Groups financial results are principally exposed to fluctuations in euro and US dollar exchange rates.
At 30 September 2015, after the effect of derivative financial instruments, approximately -2 per cent 2014: 17 per cent of the Groups reported net debt was denominated in sterling, 60 per cent in euro 2014: 76 per cent, 45 per cent in US dollars 2014: 10 per cent, and -3 per cent in other currencies 2014: -3 per cent.
Management of the Groups foreign exchange transaction and translation risk is as follows.
Transaction risk The Groups material transaction exposures arise on costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries, including the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
The Groups sterling dividends to external shareholders are primarily sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
Foreign currency flows are matched where possible and remaining foreign currency transaction exposures are not hedged.
Translation risk In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, the Group seeks to match borrowings to the currency of its investments in overseas subsidiaries which are primarily euros and US dollars.
The Group has a policy of issuing debt in the most appropriate market or markets at the time of raising new finance and to subsequently enter into derivative financial instruments, primarily cross-currency swaps, to change the currency of debt as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into foreign currencies to match the Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries are treated as a hedge against the net investment where appropriate.
Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of hypothetical changes of exchanges rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities on the Groups Income Statement and Other Comprehensive Income.
The tables below illustrate on an indicative basis, the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates attributable to the translation of monetary items held by Group companies in currencies other than their functional currencies.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain constant, and that there is no change to the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2015.
The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to revenue or non-finance costs that may result from changing exchange rates, and ignores any taxation implications and offsetting effects of movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

98 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2015 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups financial results are primarily exposed to gains or losses arising from fluctuations in euro and US dollar interest rates.
As at 30 September 2015, after adjusting for the effect of derivative financial instruments detailed in note 20, approximately 46 per cent 2014: 50 per cent of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates of interest.
The Group manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance with regard to currency and interest denomination and subsequently entering into derivative financial instruments, primarily cross-currency and interest rate swaps, to change the currency and interest rate mix to the desired position and in line with the GTC framework.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals and fair value movements of derivative financial instruments.
The Groups debt maturity profile is detailed in the contractual cash flows tables overleaf.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities on the Groups Income Statement.
The table below illustrates on an indicative basis, the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its euro, US dollar and sterling monetary items which are primarily external borrowings, cash and cash equivalents.
The impact in the Groups Income Statement reflects the effect on net finance costs in respect of the Groups net debt and the fixed to floating rate debt ratio prevailing at 30 September 2015, and ignores any taxation implications and offsetting effects of movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the net debt and derivatives portfolio remain constant and that there is no net impact on other comprehensive income.
The movement in interest rates is considered reasonable for the purpose of this analysis and the estimated effect assumes a lower limit of zero for interest rates where relevant.
2015 2014 Change in Change in million income income Income statement impact of interest rate movements: - 1% increase in euro interest rates 2014: 1% 72 32 - 1% increase in US dollar interest rates 2014: 1% 53 13 - 1% increase in sterling interest rates 2014: 1% 3 12 Credit risk The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk arising from trade receivables due from its customers, cash deposits and financial instruments held with external financial counterparties.
The maximum aggregate credit risk to these sources was considered to be 5,296 million at 30 September 2015 2014: 4,665 million restated.
Trade and other receivables The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
In order to manage its exposure to customer credit risk, policies have been implemented to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and that credit support or guarantees are obtained where appropriate.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 15.
Financial instruments In order to manage its credit risk to any one counterparty, the Group places cash deposits and enters into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions carrying suitable credit ratings in line with the GTC framework.
Utilisation of counterparty credit limits is regularly monitored by Group Treasury and ISDA agreements are in place to permit the net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
In very limited cases, collateral is deposited against derivative financial liabilities and supported by an ISDA Credit Support Annex.
The table below summarises the Groups largest exposures to financial counterparties as at 30 September 2015.
Management does not expect these counterparties to default on their current obligations at the balance sheet date.
The impact of the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and other obligations held at fair value is not considered to be material.

To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds to meet the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
To prevent over-reliance on individual sources of liquidity, funding is provided by a range of instruments including capital market issuance, bank loans and European commercial paper.
The Group borrows centrally in order to meet forecast funding requirements, and Group Treasury is in regular dialogue with subsidiaries to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies, and in very limited cases through external local borrowings.
Cash pooling processes are used to centralise surplus cash held by subsidiaries in order to minimise external borrowing requirements and interest costs.
Group Treasury invests surplus cash in bank deposits and uses forward currency contracts to manage short term liquidity requirements in line with cash flow forecasts.
As at 30 September 2015, the Group held liquid assets of 2,042 million 2014: 1,413 million restated.
The table below summarises the Groups financial liabilities by maturity based on their remaining contractual cash flows as at 30 September 2015.
The amounts disclosed are undiscounted cash flows calculated using spot rates of exchange prevailing at the relevant balance sheet date.
Contractual cash flows in respect of the Groups derivative financial instruments are detailed in note 20.

Besides the minimum capitalisation rules that may apply to subsidiaries in different countries, the Groups only externally imposed capital requirements are interest cover and gearing covenants contained within its external debt facilities, with which the Group was fully compliant during the current and prior periods and expects to be so going forward.
The Group continues to target an investment grade credit rating which it monitors by reference to a number of key financial ratios.
The framework within which the Groups capital base is managed includes the return of capital to shareholders through an appropriate mix of share buybacks and dividends.
In order to accelerate the pace of debt repayment associated with the purchase of certain US brands and assets from Reynolds American Inc. subsequent to its acquisition of Lorillard Inc. in June 2015, the Group has ceased its share buyback programme and no shares 2014: c14.2 million were repurchased during the financial year.
As at 30 September 2015 the Group was rated Baa3 negative outlook by Moodys Investors Service Ltd, BBB stable outlook by Standard & Poors Credit Market Services Europe Limited and BBB negative outlook by Fitch Ratings Limited.
Hedge accounting The Group hedges its underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner in line with the policies outlined above, although the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, and as permitted under IAS39, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting in respect of these transactions.
The Group does apply net investment hedge accounting where appropriate, and certain permanent intragroup loans are treated as a reduction in investment in the Groups foreign operations in line with IAS 21.
As at 30 September 2015 the Group had designated external euro borrowings with a carrying value of 5,237 million 2014: 5,165 million, US dollar borrowings with a carrying value of $6,750 million 2014: nil, and cross-currency swaps with a notional value of 3,871 million 2014: 2,461 million as hedges of a net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
Intragroup loans with a notional value of 2,077 million 2014: 5,440 million and US dollar loans with a notional value of $5,077 million 2014: nil were treated as a reduction in investment in the Groups foreign operations at the balance sheet date.
100 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2015 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Fair value estimation and hierarchy All financial assets and liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date Level 2 classification hierarchy per IFRS 7 as detailed in note 20.
There were no changes to the valuation methods or transfers between hierarchies during the year.
With the exception of capital market issuance, the fair value of all financial assets and financial liabilities is considered to approximate to their carrying amount as outlined in note 18.
Netting arrangements of financial instruments The following tables set out the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to netting and set-off arrangements.
Financial assets and liabilities that are subject to setoff arrangements and disclosed on a net basis in the Groups balance sheet primarily relate to cash pooling arrangements and collateral in respect of derivative financial instruments.
Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the balance sheet but could be settled net in certain circumstances principally relate to derivative transactions executed under ISDA agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.

Maturity of obligations under derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments have been classified as current or non-current on an undiscounted contractual basis based on spot rates as at the balance sheet date.
Some of the Groups derivative financial instruments contain early termination options.
For the purposes of the above and following analysis, maturity dates have been based on the likelihood of an option being exercised with consideration to counterparty expectations and market conditions prevailing as at 30 September 2015.
Any collateral transferred to counterparties in respect of derivative financial liabilities has been classified consistently with the related underlying derivative.
The table below summarises the Groups derivative financial instruments by maturity based on their remaining contractual cash flows as at 30 September 2015.

Forward currency contracts are used to manage the Groups short term liquidity requirements in line with cash flow forecasts as appropriate.
Given that the Group does not apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting, as permitted under IAS 39, fair value gains and losses attributable to derivative financial instruments are recognised in net finance costs unless they are designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate risk on the Groups borrowings is managed by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance with regard to currency and interest denomination, and then using derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the appropriate proportions of fixed and floating interest rates where necessary.
Interest rate swaps are also transacted to manage the Groups interest rate risk over the short, medium and long term in accordance with the GTC framework.
Fair value movements are recognised in net finance costs in the relevant reporting period.
As at 30 September 2015, the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding that were entered into to change fixed rate borrowings into floating rates of interest at the time of raising new finance were 11,667 million equivalent 2014: 9,141 million equivalent with a fair value of 721 million asset 2014: 524 million asset.
The fixed interest rates vary from 2.0 per cent to 8.7 per cent 2014: 2.0 per cent to 8.7 per cent, and the floating rates are EURIBOR, LIBOR and US LIBOR.
The notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date that were entered into to change the Groups debt into the appropriate proportion of fixed and floating rates to manage the Groups interest rate risk over the short, medium and long term in accordance with the GTC framework were 10,692 million equivalent 2014: 7,942 million equivalent with a fair value of 741 million liability 2014: 672 million liability.
The fixed interest rates vary from 0.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent 2014: 0.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent, and the floating rates are EURIBOR, LIBOR and US LIBOR.
This includes forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 4,990 million equivalent 2014: 2,729 million equivalent with tenors extending between three and 12 years, starting between October 2015 and October 2020.
Cross-currency swaps The Group enters into cross-currency swaps to change the currency of debt into the appropriate currency with consideration to the underlying assets of the Group as appropriate.
Fair value movements are recognised in net finance costs in the relevant reporting period unless they are designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income.
As at 30 September 2015, the notional amount of cross-currency swaps entered into to convert issued fixed rate debt into the desired currency at floating rates of interest was 650 million 2014: 650 million and the fair value of these swaps was 5 million net liability 2014: 30 million net liability.
The notional amount of cross-currency swaps entered into to convert floating rate sterling debt into the desired currency at floating rates of interest at the balance sheet date was 3,100 million 2014: 2,000 million and the fair value of these swaps was 232 million net asset 2014: 71 million net asset.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 30 September 2015 cross-currency swaps with a notional amount of 3,871 million 2014: 2,461 million were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
During the year, foreign exchange translation gains amounting to 202 million 2014: 153 million gains were recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cross-currency swaps that had been designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations.
Forward foreign currency contracts The Group enters into forward currency contracts to manage short term liquidity requirements in line with cash flow forecasts.
As at 30 September 2015 the notional amount of these contracts was 867 million equivalent 2014: 1,146 million equivalent and the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 8 million 2014: nil.

We have reviewed the recoverablility of deferred tax assets in overseas territories in the light of forecast business performance and the impact of the acquisition completed in the year.
Consequently we have increased deferred tax assets of 308 million relating to tax losses 2014: 90 million increase previously not recognised on the basis that it is more likely than not that these are recoverable.
As at the balance sheet date, deferred tax assets of 78 million 2014: 373 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, 29 million losses are expected to expire in 2016, 15 million 2014: 11 million are expected to expire within five years and 26 million 2014: 27 million are expected to expire between 2022 and 2026.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 2 million 2014: 10 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the tax related benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Deferred tax assets of 143 million 2014: 229 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the credits.
These unrecognised deferred tax assets are expected to expire between 2021 and 2027.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 5 billion 2014: 7 billion.
A provision of 50 million 2014: 4 million has been made for taxation expected to arise on a planned future remittance of earnings totalling 1.7 billion from various subsidiaries.
No liability has been recognised in respect of other differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The rate of UK corporation tax was reduced by 1 per cent from 21 per cent to 20 per cent from 1 April 2015.
No further reductions had been enacted at the balance sheet date.
However, as announced in the Chancellors Budget on 8 July 2015 the UK corporation tax rate is expected to reduce to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and to 18 per cent from 1 April 2020.
The effect of these reductions, if applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 September 2015 would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by 3 million.
22 Retirement Benefit Schemes The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes for its employees, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The Groups three principal schemes are defined benefit schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited in the UK, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany and ITG Brands Hourly scheme in the US: these schemes represent 65 per cent, 10 per cent and 7 per cent of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations and 53 per cent, 19 per cent and 4 per cent of the current service cost respectively.
Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund The UK scheme the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund or ITPF is a voluntary final salary pension scheme with a normal retirement age of 60 for most members.
The ITPF is offered to employees who joined the company before 1 October 2010 and has a weighted average maturity of 16 years.
The population comprises 62 per cent in respect of pensioners, 35 per cent in respect of deferred members and 3 per cent in respect of active employees.
New employees in the UK are now offered a defined contribution scheme.
Should surplus funds arise in the defined benefit section they may be used to finance defined contribution section contributions with company contributions reduced accordingly.
The ITPF operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The ITPFs assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the ITPF are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
The contributions paid to the ITPF are set by the ITPF Scheme Actuary every three years.
The Scheme Actuary is an external consultant, appointed by the Trustees.
Principal factors that the Scheme Actuary will have regard to include the covenant offered by Imperial Tobacco Limited, the level of risk in the ITPF, the expected returns on the ITPFs assets, the results of the funding assessment on an ongoing basis and the expected cost of securing benefits if the fund were to be discontinued.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2015 105 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 22 Retirement Benefit Schemes continued The latest valuation of the ITPF was carried out as at 31 March 2013 when the market value of the invested assets was 2,957 million.
Based on the ongoing funding target the total assets were sufficient to cover 100 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 90 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service benefits for current members.
In compliance with the Pensions Act 2004, Imperial Tobacco Limited and the Trustee agreed a scheme-specific funding target, a statement of funding principles and a schedule of contributions accordingly.
Following the valuation, the level of employers contributions to the scheme was increased from 31 million per year.
The Company paid 47.5 million on 31 March 2014 and 52.5 million in the year to 31 March 2015 and agreed to pay 57.5 million in the year to 31 March 2016 and 65 million each year for the subsequent 12 years.
Further contributions were agreed to be paid by the Company in the event of a downgrade in the credit rating of Imperial Tobacco Groups senior unsecured long-term debt.
In addition, surety guarantees with a total value of 400 million and a parental guarantee with ITG have been put in place.
The contributions agreed, plus the surety guarantees, cover the expected discontinuance cost as at the valuation date.
The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position as at 31 March each year.
The latest annual update on an ongoing basis was carried out as at 31 March 2015 and showed a surplus of 329 million in relation to past service accrued benefits.
The main risk for the Group in respect of the ITPF is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns are not sufficient to pay for the benefits which will be influenced by the factors noted above.
The level of equity returns will be a key determinant of overall investment return.
The investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical of the asset classes held, in particular credit risk on bonds and exposure to the property market.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the defined benefit obligation DBO and the current service cost are sensitive to assumptions made about future inflation and salary growth levels, as well as assumptions made about life expectation.
They are also sensitive to the discount rate, which depends on market yields on sterling denominated AA corporate bonds.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 assumptions are a more prudent longevity assumption for funding and a different approach to setting the discount rate.
A consequence of the ITPFs investment strategy, with a significant proportion of the assets invested in equities and other return-seeking assets, is that the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be relatively volatile.
The Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken Pension Plan The German scheme, the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken Pension Plan RCPP, is primarily a career average pension plan that is open to new entrants, though a small closed group of members has final salary benefits.
It has a weighted average maturity of 18 years.
The scheme population comprises 53 per cent in respect of pensioners, 16 per cent in respect of deferred members and 31 per cent in respect of active employees.
The plan is unfunded and the company pays benefits as they arise.
The plans obligations arise under a works council agreement and are subject to standard German legal requirements around such matters as the benefits to be provided to employees who leave service, and pension increases in payment.
Over the next year Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH expects to pay 19 million in respect of benefits.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the plan are future inflation levels and the actual longevity of the membership.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost are sensitive to assumptions made about the above variables, as well as the discount rate, which depends on market yields on euro denominated AA corporate bonds.
ITG Brands Hourly Pension Plan The USA pension scheme, the ITG Brands Hourly Pension Plan ITGBH, is a defined benefit pension plan that is open to new entrants.
It has a weighted average maturity of 11 years.
The population comprises 66 per cent in respect of pensioners, 3 per cent in respect of deferred members and 31 per cent in respect of active employees.
The plan is funded and benefits are paid from the plan assets.
Over the next year the plan expects to pay 23 million in respect of benefits.
Contributions to the plan are determined based on US regulatory requirements.
Annual benefits in payment do not increase.
The main uncertainty affecting the level of benefits payable under the plan is the actual longevity of the membership.
Other key uncertainties impacting the plan include investment risk and potential past service benefit changes from future negotiations.
The IAS19 liability measurement of the defined benefit obligation and the service cost are sensitive to assumptions made about the above variables, as well as the discount rate, which depends on market yields on US dollar denominated AA corporate bonds.
Other plans Other plans of the Group include various pension plans, other post-employment and long-term employee benefit plans in several countries of operation.
Many of the plans are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts, others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the plans reflect their local environments.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate for calculating the DBO and service cost is set according to the level of relevant market yields on corporate bonds where the market is considered deep, or government bonds where it is not.
106 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2015 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the various plans have been updated to 30 September 2015 in order to determine the amounts to be included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The aggregate IAS 19 position is as follows: Defined benefit plans 2015 2014 million DBO Assets Total DBO Assets Total At 1 October 4,315 3,535 780 4,400 3,350 1,050 Consolidated income statement expense Current service cost 48 48 49 49 Past service credit Spanish free tobacco settlement 52 52 Past service credit curtailment 2 2 69 69 Cost of termination benefits 8 8 32 32 Net interest expense income on net defined benefit liability asset 157 138 19 174 138 36 Administration costs paid from plan assets 2 2 3 3 Cost income recognised in the income statement 75 1 Remeasurements Actuarial gain due to liability experience 37 37 38 38 Actuarial loss due to financial assumption changes 121 121 202 202 Actuarial loss gain due to demographic assumption changes 2 2 22 22 Return on plan assets excluding amounts in net interest income above 58 58 187 187 Remeasurement effects recognised in OCI 28 45 Cash Employer contributions 101 101 116 116 Employee contributions 2 2 2 2 Benefits paid directly by the company 36 36 46 46 Benefits paid from plan assets 175 175 181 181 Net cash 101 116 Other Obligations and assets of acquired operations 437 367 70 Spanish free tobacco settlement 48 48 Exchange movements 50 15 35 88 28 60 Total other 35 108 At 30 September 4,790 3,973 817 4,315 3,535 780 Termination benefits in the year ended 30 September 2015 mainly relate to restructuring activity in Germany.
In the year ended 30 September 2014, there were a number of special events that have impacted the liabilities and the costs of the Groups retirement benefit schemes.
The announcement of the proposed closure of the Nottingham factory gave rise to a curtailment gain of 55 million and termination costs of 25 million.
Other redundancies in the United Kingdom and Germany gave rise to termination costs of 7 million.
We reached an agreement in Spain with around 70 per cent of pensioners who had previously received payments in respect of former entitlements to free cigarettes to accept a one-off cash payment in full settlement.
This has given rise to a past service credit of 52 million.
The cash settlement of 48 million was paid at the beginning of October 2014 and the liability was recognised in the balance sheet at 30 September 2014 in other liabilities.
In the Netherlands the defined benefit scheme has been replaced by a multi-employer scheme for most employees which is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme under IAS 19, because it is not possible to determine the Groups share of the plan assets and by a defined contribution plan for some employees.
As a consequence of these changes a curtailment gain of 14 million was recognised in the year to 30 September 2014.

Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the financial statements.
29 Acquisitions On 12 June 2015 the Group completed the purchase of the Winston, Salem, Kool and Maverick cigarette brands and the blu e-cigarette brand from Reynolds, together with the national sales force, office and production facilities previously owned by Lorillard for a cash consideration of $7,056 million 4,613 million.
