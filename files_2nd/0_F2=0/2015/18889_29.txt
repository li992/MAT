Reclassification of deferred tax liabilities and assets Previously under UK GAAP, the Company presented: the retirement benefit asset net of the related deferred tax liability.
Under FRS 101, deferred tax liabilities are separately disclosed as non-current liabilities on the balance sheet: and deferred tax assets in relation to share based payments as current trade receivables.
Under FRS 101, deferred tax assets are offset with deferred tax liabilities when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
Based on the above, the following reclassification adjustments were recognised: 1 Jan 2014 31 Dec 2014 m m Increase retirement benefit asset 6.7 0.3 Decrease trade and other receivables 2.8 2.4 Net reclassification adjustment to increase deferred tax liabilities 3.9 2.1 2.
Remeasurement of the retirement benefit asset Remeasurement to reflect movement from FRS 17 to the requirements of IAS 19.
Based on the above, the following remeasurement adjustments have been recognised: 1 Jan 2014 31 Dec 2014 m m Increase retirement benefit asset 19.6 67.9 Increase trade and other payables 45.5 48.2 Decrease trade and other receivables 29.2 3.
Remeasurement of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables Previously under UK GAAP, the Company recognised all tax related balances corporation tax and deferred tax of the Group on the basis that all United Kingdom based entities are treated as a single entity for tax purposes.
Under IFRS, tax balances that relate to the activities, assets and liabilities of other subsidiary companies should not be recognised in the financial statements of the Company.
Based on the above, the remeasurement adjustment to trade and other receivables consists of the following: 1 Jan 2014 31 Dec 2014 m m fide-recognition of corporation tax debtor balances 2.8 9.4 Reduction of deferred tax asset balances 13.6 16.7 Trade and other receivables 0.5 Total 16.4 25.6 4.
Remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities The deferred tax liabilities of the Company have been restated as a result of the derecognition of the deferred tax asset in relation to the asset limit, adjustments to the actuarial gain recognised in other comprehensive income and other temporary differences relating to the retirement benefit asset.
1 Jan 2014 31 Dec 2014 m m Increase retirement benefit asset related deferred tax liabilities 6.9 13.5 18 Subsequent events There were no material subsequent events that required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.
