EEV SENSITIVITIES The table below shows the estimated impact on the combined life and unit trust reported value of new business and EEV to changes in key assumptions.
The sensitivities are specified by the EEV principles and reflect reasonably possible levels of change.
In each case, only the indicated item is varied relative to the restated values.
Change in European Change in new business Embedded contribution Value Note Pre-tax Post-tax Post-tax Million Million Million Value at 31 December 2015 440.7 358.9 3,868.2 100bp reduction in risk free rates, with corresponding change in fixed interest asset values 1 5.6 4.7 26.1 10% reduction in withdrawal rates: 2 Pensions 17.7 14.4 85.3 Other 22.9 18.7 127.9 Total 40.6 33.1 213.2 10% reduction in expenses 3 7.3 6.0 29.7 10% reduction in market value of equity assets 4 371.2 5% reduction in mortality and morbidity 5 100bp increase in equity expected returns 6 100bp increase in assumed inflation 7 7.7 6.3 34.3 Note 1: This is the key economic basis change sensitivity.
The business model is relatively insensitive to change in economic basis.
Note that the sensitivity assumes a corresponding change in all investment returns but no change in inflation.
Note 2: The 10% reduction is applied to the lapse rate.
For instance, if the lapse rate is 8% then a 10% sensitivity reduction would reflect a change to 7.2%.
Note 3: The new business contribution within the EEV does not reflect future expense levels that would apply under the new administration contract.
Note 4: For the purposes of this required sensitivity, all unit linked funds are assumed to be invested in equities.
The actual mix of assets varies and in recent years the proportion invested directly in UK and overseas equities has exceeded 70%.
Note 5: Assumes the benefit of lower experience is passed on to clients and reassurers at the earliest opportunity.
Note 6: As a market-consistent approach is used, equity expected returns only affect the derived discount rates and not the embedded value or contribution to profit from new business.
Note 7: Assumed inflation is set by reference to ten year index linked gilt yields.
Change in European Change in new business Embedded contribution Value Pre-tax Post-tax Post-tax Million Million Million 100bp reduction in risk discount rate 55.5 45.2 271.3 Although not directly relevant under a market-consistent valuation, this sensitivity shows the level of adjustment which would be required to reflect differing investor views of risk.
