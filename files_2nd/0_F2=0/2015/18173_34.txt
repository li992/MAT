2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for all periods presented.
Transition details showing all material adjustments are disclosed in note 10.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: a the requirements of paragraphs 45 b and 46-52 of IFRS 2 Share based Payment, b t he requirements of paragraphs 62, B64 d, B64 e, B64 g, B64 h, B64 j to B64 m, B64 n ii, B64 o ii, B64 p, B64 q ii, B66 and B67 of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, c the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, e the requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, f the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in respect of: i paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: ii paragraph 73 e of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: iii paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible Assets: iv paragraphs 76 and 79 d of IAS 40 Investment Property: and v paragraph 50 of IAS 41 Agriculture.
g the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 39 c and 134-136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: h the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: i the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: j the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: k t he requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member: and l the requirements of paragraphs 134 d -134 f and 135 c -135 e of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated Financial Statements of the Group in which the entity is consolidated.
Intellectual property Licences purchased in respect of intellectual property are capitalised, classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the licence, normally 20 years.
Depreciation of fixed assets Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on all other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 25 years Investment property Investment property is defined as land and or buildings held by the Company to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
The Company recognises any part of an owned or leased under a finance lease property that is leased to third-parties as investment property, unless it represents an insignificant portion of the property.
Investment property is measured initially at cost including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company elected to measure investment property at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any i. e. applying the same accounting policies including useful lives as for property, plant and equipment.
The fair values, which reflect the market conditions at the balance sheet date, are disclosed in note 4.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
134 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Impairment of assets The carrying values of assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Share-based payment transactions The accounting policy in relation to share-based payment transactions is disclosed in full in the consolidated Financial Statements.
In addition to that, the financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual Financial Statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
On transition to IFRS, the Group did not apply the measurement rules of IFRS 2 to equity settled awards granted before 7 November 2002 or granted after that date and vested before 1 January 2005.
However later modifications of such equity instruments are measured under IFRS 2.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current tax rate.
Where Group relief is surrendered from other subsidiaries in the Group, the Company is required to pay to the surrendering company an amount equal to the loss surrendered multiplied by the current tax rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Own shares held Shares in the Company held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.

9 AUDITORS REMUNERATION All Auditors remuneration is borne by Computacenter UK Ltd, a fully-owned UK subsidiary of the Company.
10 TRANSITION TO FRS 101 For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its Financial Statements in accordance with previously extant United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These Financial Statements, for the year ended 31 December 2015, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual Financial Statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in the relevant notes.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014, the Companys date of transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for the first time adoption of FRS 101.
As such, this note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its balance sheet as at 1 January 2013 prepared under previously extant UK GAAP and its previously published UK GAAP Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements of paragraphs 6-13 of IFRS 1 first time adoption of international financial reporting standards.
Exemptions applied IFRS 1 allows first time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirements to apply IFRSs as effective for December 2015 year ends retrospectively.
The Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions: Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based payment has not been applied to any equity instrument that were granted on or before 7 November 2002, nor has it been applied to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that vested before 1 January 2005.
This treatment is consistent with the transitional provisions taken when the Company adopted FRS 20, the UK equivalent standard.
137 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 10 TRANSITION TO FRS 101 CONTINUED Merger accounting and the merger reserve Prior to 1 January 2013, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
These transactions have not been restated, as permitted by the IFRS 1 transitional arrangements.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90 per cent of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.
Reconciliation from UK GAAP to FRS 101 Investment property Property, plant and equipment, which represented, freehold land and building has been reclassified to investment property in line with IAS 40 on transition to FRS 101.
The freehold land and building are leased to Computacenter UK Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of the Company.
Under SSAP 19 old UK GAAP, there was an exemption available to treat properties let to and occupied by Group entities as property, plant and equipment, however it is not allowed under IAS 40.
There were no other transitional adjustments recorded.
11 DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES Dividends are paid from the standalone balance sheet of Computacenter plc, and as at 31 December 2015, the distributable reserves are approximately 166.7 million.
