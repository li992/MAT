Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Exchange rates The results of operations have been translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the year.
Assets and liabilities have been translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange on the last day of the year.
Segmental information The management of the Groups operations, excluding Central functions, is organised within four geographical regions: Americas: Europe: Asia, Middle East and Africa AMEA : and Greater China These, together with Central functions, comprise the Groups five reportable segments.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form these reportable segments.
Central functions include costs of global functions including technology, sales and marketing, finance, human resources and corporate services: central revenue arises principally from technology fee income.
Central liabilities include the loyalty programme liability and the cumulative short-term System Fund surplus.
Each of the geographical regions is led by its own Chief Executive officer and derives its revenues from either franchising, managing or owning hotels and additional segmental disclosures are provided accordingly.
Management monitors the operating results of the geographical regions and Central functions separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segmental performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured consistently with operating profit or loss in the Consolidated Financial Statements, excluding exceptional items.
Group nancing activities and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to reportable segments.

The above items are treated as exceptional by reason of their size or nature, as further described on page 98. a A rises from changes to the Venezuelan exchange rate mechanisms and the adoption of the SIMADI exchange rate in 2015 and the SICAD II exchange rate in 2014, these being the most accessible exchange rates open to the Group for converting its bolivar earnings into US dollars.
The exceptional losses arise from the re-measurement of the Groups bolivar assets and liabilities to the relevant exchange rates, being approximately $1 190VEF on adoption of SIMADI and approximately $1 50VEF on adoption of SICAD II.
The Group has used the SIMADI exchange rate for translating the results of its Venezuelan operations since 1 April 2015. b R elates to the implementation of more efficient processes and procedures in the Groups Global Technology infrastructure to help mitigate future cost increases, together with, in 2014, costs incurred in introducing a new HR operating model across the business to provide enhanced management information and more efficient processes.
These restructuring programmes have now been completed.
c Primarily legal costs related to development opportunities.
d R elated to acquisition transaction costs incurred in the period to 31 December 2014 on the acquisition of Kimpton, which completed on 16 January 2015 see note 10. e Relates to the initial costs of integrating Kimpton into the operations of the Group.
The integration programme remains in progress and further costs will be incurred in 2016. f I n 2014, resulted from a partial cash-out of the UK unfunded pension arrangements and, in 2013, resulted from a buy-in and subsequent buy-out in 2014 of the Groups UK funded dened benefit obligations with the insurer, Rothesay Life.
See note 25 for further details.

In 2014, the charge comprised $56m relating to the disposal of an 80.1% interest in InterContinental New York Barclay offset by a credit of $27m relating to a restructuring of the UK hotel portfolio and other reorganisation costs.
k I n 2013, comprised a deferred tax charge of $63m consequent on the disposal of InterContinental London Park Lane, together with charges and credits of $38m and $19m respectively from associated restructurings including intra-group dividends and renancings, offset by the recognition of $37m of previously unrecognised tax credits.

The UK statutory tax rate will reduce to 18% on 1 April 2020.
The Group does not anticipate this change having a material effect.
Tax paid Total net tax paid during the year of $110m 2014: $136m, 2013: $97m comprises $109m 2014: $136m, 2013: $92m paid in respect of operating activities and $1m 2014: $nil, 2013: $5m paid in respect of investing activities.
Tax paid represents an effective rate of 8% 2014: 23%, 2013: 16% on total profits and is lower than the effective income statement tax rate of 30% 2014: 31%, 2013: 29% primarily due to the impact of exceptional accounting gains taxable on a deferred basis, without which the equivalent effective rate would be 20%.
The remaining difference is primarily due to deferred taxes including the realisation of assets such as tax losses, the receipt of refunds in respect of prior years and provisions for tax for which no payment of tax has currently been made.
Corporation tax liabilities did not arise in 2015 in the UK and are not expected to arise for a number of years thereafter due to expenses and associated tax losses attributable principally to employment matters, inparticular additional shortfall contributions made to the UK pension plan in the years 2007 to 2013.

The deferred tax asset recognised in respect of losses of $67m 2014: $154m includes $nil 2014: $50m in respect of capital losses available to be utilised against the realisation of capital gains which are recognised as a deferred tax liability and $67m 2014: $104m in respect of revenue tax losses.
Deferred tax assets of $nil 2014: $20m are recognised in relation to legal entities which suffered a tax loss in the current or preceding period.
Deferred gains on investments represent taxable gains which would crystallise upon a sale of a related joint venture, associate or other equity investment.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets as follows: 2015 2014 $m $m Revenue losses 47 126 Capital losses 114 130 a Total losses 161 256 Employee benets 5 5 b Other 28 58 Total 194 319 a T hese may be carried forward indefinitely other than $9m which expires after one year, $1m which expires after five years, $7m which expires after six years, $3m which expires after seven years and $1m which expires after eight years 2014: $11m which expires after two years, $1m which expires after six years, $8m which expires after seven years, $1m which expires after eight years and $2m which expires after nine years.
b Primarily relates to provisions, accruals, amortisation and share-based payments.
These assets have not been recognised as the Group does not currently anticipate being able to offset these against future profits or gains in order to realise any economic benefit in the foreseeable future.
However, future benets may arise as a result of resolving tax uncertainties, or as a consequence of case law and legislative developments which make the value of the assets more certain.
The Group has provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with post-acquisition undistributed earnings of subsidiaries only to the extent that it is either probable that it will reverse in the foreseeable future or where the Group cannot control the timing of the reversal.
The remaining unprovided liability that would arise on the reversal of these temporary differences is not expected to exceed $10m 2014: $10m.

Acquisition of business On 16 January 2015, the Group acquired a 100% ownership interest in Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group, LLC Kimpton, an unlisted company based in the US.
Kimpton is the worlds largest independent boutique hotel operator and the acquisition makes IHG the market leader in the boutique segment.
The fair values of the identiable assets and liabilities of Kimpton at the date of acquisition were as follows: $m Identiable intangible assets: Brands 193 Management contracts 71 Software 2 Property, plant and equipment 3 Other financial assets 10 Trade and other receivables 29 Cash and cash equivalents 3 Trade and other payables 27 Non-current liabilities 10 Net identiable assets acquired 274 Goodwill 167 Total purchase consideration 441 Net cash outow arising on acquisition: $m Cash consideration, including working capital payment of $11m 441 Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired 3 438 The goodwill is mainly attributable to the growth opportunities identied for the acquired business, both in the US and globally, plus cost synergies expected to arise.
The amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes is $164m.
Included in trade and other receivables are trade receivables with a gross contractual value of $26m, which are expected to be collectable in full.
The fair value of trade receivables approximates the book value of $26m.
No contingent liabilities were recognised as a result of the acquisition.
Kimpton contributed revenue of $59m and operating profit of $18m for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
The results of Kimpton are included in the Americas managed business segment.
If the acquisition had taken place at 1 January 2015, there would have been no material difference to reported Group revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Integration costs of $10m were charged to exceptional administrative expenses in the year ended 31 December 2015.
Acquisition transaction costs of $7m were charged to exceptional administrative expenses in the year ended 31 December 2014.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill and brands During the year, the Group acquired Kimpton see note 10 resulting in the recognition of goodwill of $167m and brands of $193m, together with management contracts of $71m.
The Kimpton brands are considered to have an indefinite life given their strong brand awareness and reputation in the upscale boutique hotel sector, and managements commitment to continued investment in their growth.
The brands are protected by trademarks and there are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of the brands.
In the hotel industry there are a number of brands that have existed for many years and IHG has brands that are over 60 years old.
The Group tests goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indicators that an impairment may have arisen.
The year-end carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life brands have been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing purposes as follows: 2015 2014 Goodwill Brands Goodwill $m $m $m CGU Americas Managed 63 193 Americas Franchised 37 Europe Managed 21 Europe Franchised 10 AMEA Managed and Franchised 102 74 233 193 74 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations cover a five-year period using pre-tax cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management incorporating growth rates based on managements past experience and industry growth forecasts.
A terminal value is added using growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
The cash ows are discounted using pre-tax rates that are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reect the risks specic to the business model and territory of the CGU being tested.
The terminal growth rates and discount rates used in the impairment tests are as follows: Terminal growth rate Discount rate 2015 2014 2015 2014 % % % % Americas Managed 2.5 n a 10.2 n a Americas Franchised 2.5 n a 9.2 n a Europe Managed 2.5 n a 9.9 n a Europe Franchised 2.5 n a 8.9 n a AMEA Managed and Franchised 3.5 3.5 12.5 13.7 Impairment was not required at either 31 December 2015 or 31 December 2014.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Software Software includes $85m relating to the development of the next-generation Guest Reservation System with Amadeus.
This asset is not yet in use and therefore not being amortised.
Substantially all software additions are internally developed.
Management contracts In addition to the management contracts acquired with the Kimpton acquisition, additions to management contracts relate to contract values recognised as part of the proceeds for hotels sold see note 11.

Financial risk management Overview The Groups treasury policy is to manage financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs.
The activities of the treasury function are carried out in accordance with Board approved policies and are subject to regular audit.
The treasury function does not operate as a profit centre.
The treasury function seeks to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group and manages liquidity to meet all foreseeable cash needs.
Treasury activities may include money market investments, repurchase agreements, spot and forward foreign exchange instruments, currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
One of the primary objectives of the Groups treasury risk management policy is to mitigate the adverse impact of movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Market risk exposure The US dollar is the predominant currency of the Groups revenue and cash ows.
Movements in foreign exchange rates can affect the Groups reported profit, net assets and interest cover.
To hedge foreign exchange exposure, wherever possible, the Group matches the currency of its debt either directly or via derivatives to the currency of its net assets, whilst maximising the amount of US dollars borrowed to reect the predominant trading currency.
From time to time, foreign exchange transaction exposure is managed by the forward purchase or sale of foreign currencies.
Most significant exposures of the Group are in currencies that are freely convertible.
Interest rate exposure is managed, using interest rate swaps if appropriate, within set parameters depending on the term of the debt, with a minimum xed proportion of 25% of borrowings for each major currency.
100% of borrowings in major currencies were xed rate debt at 31 December 2015, with the exception of overdrafts.
No interest rate swaps were used during 2015, 2014 or 2013.
Market risk sensitivities The following table shows the impact of a general strengthening in the US dollar against sterling and euro on the Groups profit before tax and net assets, and the impact of a rise in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates on the Groups profit before tax.

The Syndicated and Bilateral facilities contain two financial covenants: interest cover and net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group has been in compliance with all of the financial covenants in its loan documents throughout the year, none of which is expected to present a material restriction on funding in the near future.
At the year end, the Group had cash of $1,137m which is predominantly held in short-term deposits, repurchase agreements, and cash funds which allow daily withdrawals of cash.
The Group also had overdrafts of $39m as part of cash pooling arrangements see note 17.
Most of the Groups funds are held in the UK or US, although $1m 2014: $4m is held in countries where repatriation is restricted as a result of foreign exchange regulations.

Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk on treasury transactions is minimised by operating a policy on the investment of surplus cash that generally restricts counterparties to those with a BBB credit rating or better or those providing adequate security.
The Group uses long-term credit ratings from Standard and Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings as a basis for setting its counterparty limits.
During the year, the policy was amended from a minimum A credit rating to reect current market conditions.
Short-term deposits The table below analyses the Groups short-term deposits at 31 December 2015 by counterparty credit rating.
AAA AAA A BBB Total Short-term deposits 497 82 30 79 15 703 Repurchase agreements The Group invests in repurchase agreements, which are fully collateralised investments, with a maturity of three months or less.
The Group accepts only government or supranational bonds where the lowest credit rating is AAor better as collateral.
In the event of default, ownership of these securities would revert to the Group.
The securities held as collateral are valued at a discount of 2% to market value to protect against market volatility in the event of a default by the counterparty.
The table below contains information about the collateral held as security at 31 December 2015.
2015 Collateral by type $m Government bonds 36 Supranational bonds 253 289 2015 Collateral by credit rating $m AAA 243 AA 42 AA 4 289 In order to manage the Groups credit risk exposure, the treasury function sets counterparty exposure limits using metrics including credit ratings, the relative placing of credit default swap pricings, Tier 1 capital and share price volatility of the relevant counterparty.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Itis the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verication procedures.
In respect of credit risk arising from financial assets, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of theseinstruments.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.

Financial risk management continued Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern.
The capital structure consists of net debt, issued share capital and reserves totalling $838m at 31December 2015 2014: $808m.
The structure is managed to maintain an investment grade credit rating, to provide ongoing returns to shareholders and to service debt obligations, whilst maintaining maximum operational exibility.
A key characteristic ofIHGs managed and franchised business model is that it is highlycash generative, with a high return on capital employed.
Surplus cash is either reinvested in the business, used to repay debt or returned to shareholders.
The Groups debt is monitored on the basis of a cash ow leverage ratio, being net debt divided by EBITDA, with the objective of maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments At 31 December 2015, the Group held short dated foreign exchange swaps with principals of nil 2014: 220m and $481m 2014: $31m.
The swaps are used to manage sterling surplus cash and reduce euro and US dollar borrowings whilst maintaining operational exibility.
The fair value of these derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2015 was a $3m liability 2014: $2m asset.
Hedging Interest rate risk The Group hedges its interest rate risk by ensuring that interest ows are xed on at least 25% of its borrowings inmajor currencies.
If required, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure although none were held during 2015 or 2014.
The Group designates interest rate swaps as cash ow hedges.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on income streams denominated in foreign currencies.
From time to time, the Group hedges a portion of forecast foreign currency income by taking out forward exchange contracts.
The designated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk.
There were no such contracts in place at either 31December 2015 or 31 December 2014.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations Where hedge accounting is applied, the Group designates certain foreign currency bank borrowings and currencyderivatives as net investment hedges of foreign operations.
The designated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk for loans and shortdated derivatives.
The interest on these financial instruments is taken through financial income or expense.
The maximum amount of foreign exchange derivatives held during the year as net investment hedges and measured at calendar quarter ends were currency swaps with a principal of $nil 2014: $415m and short dated foreign exchange swaps with principals of 285m 2014: 220m and $315m 2014: $165m.
Hedge effectiveness is measured at calendar quarter ends.
Noineffectiveness arose in respect of the Groups net investment hedges during the current or prior year.

Unsecured bank loans Unsecured bank loans are borrowings under the Groups Syndicated and Bilateral facilities.
Amounts are classied as non-current when the facilities have more than 12 months to expiry.
The Syndicated Facility comprises a $1,275m five-year revolving credit facility maturing in March 2020, with two one-year extension options exercisable in 2016 and 2017.
This replaced the $1.07bn five-year revolving facility maturing in November 2016 following a successful renancing of the facility in March 2015, which resulted in a reduction in the interest margin payable.
The Bilateral Facility comprises a $75m revolving credit facility maturing in March 2020, with two one-year extension options exercisable in 2016 and 2017.
The Bilateral Facility contains the same terms and covenants as the Syndicated Facility.
A variable rate of interest is payable on amounts drawn under both facilities, which were undrawn at 31 December 2015.
Secured bank loan The secured bank loan related to a New Zealand dollar mortgage which was secured on the related hotel property and was repayable by instalments.

There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis, or for which fair value is disclosed.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximates book value due to the short maturity of the investments and deposits, and the fair value of other financial assets approximates book value based on prevailing market rates.
The fair value of the secured and unsecured bank loans approximates book value as interest rates reset to market rates on a frequent basis.
The fair value of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and current provisions approximates to their carrying value, including the future redemption liability of the Groups loyalty programme.

Fair value measurement continued There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the year and no transfers into and out of Level 3.
The fair value of quoted equity shares and the bonds is based on their quoted market price.
Derivatives are fair valued using discounted future cash ows, taking into consideration exchange rates prevailing on the last day of the reporting period and interest rates from observable swap curves.
Finance lease obligations relate primarily to the lease of InterContinental Boston, which is fair valued by discounting the future cash ows payable under the loan, which are xed, at a risk adjusted long-term interest rate.
The interest rate used to discount the cash ows at 31 December 2015 was 7.0% 2014: 7.4%.
Unquoted equity shares are fair valued using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines either by applying an average price-earnings P E ratio for a competitor group to the earnings generated by the investment or by reference to share of net assets if the investment is currently loss-making or a recent property valuation is available.
The average P E ratio for the year was 21.9 2014: 24.0 and anon-marketability factor of 30% 2014: 30% is applied.
A 10% increase in the average P E ratio would result in a $3m increase 2014: $3m in the fair value of the investments and a 10% decrease in the average P E ratio would result in a $3m decrease 2014: $3m in the fair value of the investments.
A 10% increase in net assets would result in a $8m increase 2014: $7m in the fair value of the investments and a 10% decrease in net assets would result in a $8m decrease 2014: $7m in the fair value of the investments.

Retirement benets UK Since 6 August 2014, UK retirement and death in service benets are provided for eligible employees by the IHG UK Dened Contribution Pension Plan.
Members, including those who have been auto-enrolled since 1 September 2013, are provided with dened contribution arrangements under this plan: benets are based on each individual members personal account.
The plan is HM Revenue & Customs registered and governed by an independent trustee, assisted by professional advisers as and when required.
The overall operation of the plan is subject to the oversight of The Pensions Regulator.
The former dened benefit plan, the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan, was wound up on 21 July 2015 following the completion of the buy-out and transfer of the dened benefit obligations to Rothesay Life on 31 October 2014.
Residual dened benefit obligations remain in respect of additional benets provided to members of an unfunded pension arrangement who were affected by lifetime or annual allowances under the former dened benefit arrangements.
Accrual under this arrangement ceased with effect from 1 July 2013 and a cash-out offer in 2014 resulted in the extinguishment of approximately 70% of the unfunded pension obligations.
The Company meets the benefit payment obligations of the remaining members as they fall due.
A charge over certain ring-fenced bank accounts totalling 31m at 31 December 2015 see note 15 is currently held as security on behalf of the remaining members.
US and other The Group also maintains the following US-based dened benefit plans: the funded Inter-Continental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels Non-qualied Pension Plans and unfunded Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation Postretirement Medical, Dental, Vision and Death benefit Plan.
All plans are closed to new members.
In respect of the funded plan, an Investment Committee has responsibility for the oversight and management of the plans assets, which are held in a separate trust.
The Committee comprises senior company employees and is assisted by professional advisers as and when required.
The company currently makes contributions that equal or exceed the minimum funding amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 ERISA.
The investment objective is to achieve full funding over time by following a specified glide path approach which results in a progressive switching from return seeking assets to liability-matching assets as the funded status of the plan increases.
At 31 December 2015, over 80% of the plan assets were held in liability-matching assets.
During the year, the Group made a lump sum cash-out offer to the terminated vested members of the Inter-Continental Hotels Pension Plan.
Members accepting the offer received lump sum cash payments totalling $11m on 1 November 2015.
The Group also operates a number of smaller pension schemes outside the UK, themost significant of which is a dened contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
In respect of the dened benefit plans, the amounts recognised in the Group income statement, in administrative expenses, are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US and other benets Total 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Current service cost 2 11 13 Past service cost 1 1 Net interest expense 1 2 3 33 1 11 5 64 Administration costs 1 31 1 1 2 32 Settlement gain 2 2 Operating profit before exceptional items 2 53 2 46 1 11 5 10 10 Exceptional items: Settlement cost 6147 6147 2 11 150 2 46 1 11 5 16 157 The settlement gain in 2015 results from the partial cash-out of the US Inter-Continental Hotels Pension Plan and comprises the difference between the accounting value of the liabilities extinguished and the amount of the lump sum payments.
The settlement cost in 2014 resulted from the partial cash-out of the UK unfunded pension arrangements and comprised transaction and related social security costs of $9m, offset by the $3m difference between the accounting value of the liabilities extinguished and the amount of the committed cash-out payments.
In 2014, related cash payments of $53m are included in cash ows relating to exceptional operating items in the Group statement of cash ows.
The settlement cost in 2013 resulted from the buy-in transaction that preceded the full buy-out of the dened benefit arrangements and comprised a past service cost of $5m relating to additional benets secured by the transaction, the $137m difference between the cost of the insurance policy and the accounting value of the liabilities secured and transaction costs of $5m.
As the policy was structured to enable the planto move to a buy-out and the intention was to proceed on that basis, the buy-in transaction was accounted for as a settlement with the loss arising recorded in the income statement.

Retirement benets continued Assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the benefit obligations are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US benets 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 % % % % % % % % % Pensions increases 3.2 3.3 3.6 Discount rate 4.0 3.7 4.6 3.9 3.6 4.5 3.9 3.7 4.6 Ination rate 3.2 3.3 3.6 Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year: Pre 65 ultimate rate reached in 2022 7.5 8.0 8.5 Post 65 ultimate rate reached in 2024 9.0 12.5 17.5 Ultimate rate that the cost trend rate trends to 4.5 5.0 5.2 Mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
The current assumptions for the UK are based on the S1NA tables with long cohort projections and a 1.25% per annum underpin to future mortality improvements with age rated down by three years for pensioners and nonpensioners.
In the US, the current assumptions are based on the RP-2014 Employee Healthy Annuitant Generationally Projected with Scale MP-2015 mortality tables.
In the US, the assumption has been revised during the year to reect reduced life expectancy at retirement age as follows: Pension plans UK US 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Years Years Years Years Years Years a Current pensioners at 65 male 26 26 24 21 22 21 female 29 29 27 23 24 23 b Future pensioners at 65 male 28 28 27 23 23 22 female 31 31 30 25 25 25 a Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the end of the reporting period.
b Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years relating to an employee retiring in 2035.
The assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
Sensitivities Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the statement of financial position.
The key assumptions are the pension increases, discount rate, the rate of ination and the assumed mortality rate.
The sensitivity analysis below is based on extrapolating reasonable changes in these assumptions, using year-end conditions and assuming no interdependency between the assumptions.
