OBLIGATIONS UNDER FINANCE LEASES The finance lease obligations recorded in the accounts arise from a sale and leaseback transaction of one of the Groups office buildings in 1997 which falls to be treated as a finance lease under IAS 17 - Leases.
The lease was due to expire in 2019 and was subject to five yearly rent reviews, with guaranteed minimum rent increases.
During the year ended 30 September 2014 the freehold of the property was reacquired by the Company and the liability was extinguished note 26.
The minimum lease payments payable under this lease were: 2015 2014 2013 m m m Amounts payable Within one year - - 2.4 Within two to five years - - 9.6 After five years - - 0.6 - - 12.6 Less: future finance charges - - 2.4 Present value of lease obligations - - 10.2 The present value of these payments recognised in the financial statements was: 2015 2014 2013 m m m Amounts payable Within one year - - 1.6 Within two to five years - - 8.0 After five years - - 0.6 - - 10.2 The fair value of the lease obligation was not considered to be materially different to the present value of the future obligations shown above.
The interest rate implicit in the lease at 30 September 2013 was 7.99%.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS a Defined benefit plan - Description The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK the Plan.
The Plan assets are held in a separate fund, administered by a corporate trustee, to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Plan is required by law to act in the best interests of the Plans beneficiaries and is responsible for the investment policy adopted in respect of the Plans assets.
The appointment of directors to the Trustee is determined by the Plans trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all directors of the Trustee should be nominated by active and pensioner members of the Plan.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 217 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS Employees who are members of the Plan are entitled to receive a pension of 1 60 of their final basic annual salary for every year of eligible service to a maximum of 2 3.
Dependants of members of the Plan are eligible for a dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
The principal actuarial risks to which the Plan is exposed are: Investment risk The risk that income is generated on the Plans investments at a rate lower than the rate at which the defined benefit liability is calculated, which would cause an increased deficit in the Plan.
The Trustee keeps the allocation of the Plans investments under review to manage this risk on a long term basis Interest risk A decrease in bond yields will reduce the discount rate used in valuing the deficit and hence increase the Plan liability Inflation risk A rise in inflation will increase the benefits payable to Plan members, which would increase the Plan liability Longevity risk The value of the Plan deficit is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality rate among Plan members both during and after employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the members would increase the deficit in the Plan Salary risk The valuation of the Plan assumes a level of future salary increases based on a premium over the expected rate of inflation.
Should the salaries of Plan members increase at a higher rate then the deficit will be higher The risks relating to death in service payments are insured with an external insurance company.
As a result of the Plan having been closed to new entrants since February 2002, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salaries is expected to increase as the average age of active members rises over time.
However the membership is expected to reduce so that the service cost in monetary terms will gradually reduce.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Plans liabilities, obtained by the Trustee, was carried out at 31 March 2013, by Mercer, an independent actuary.
This showed that the value of the Plans liabilities on a buy-out basis in accordance with section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004 was 144.5m, with a shortfall against the assets of 67.2m.
Following the 2013 actuarial valuation, the Trustee put in place a recovery plan.
The Trustees recovery plan aims to meet the statutory funding objective within six years and five months from the date of valuation, that is by 31 August 2019. b Defined benefit plan Financial impact For accounting purposes the valuation at 31 March 2013 was updated to 30 September 2015 in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 revised by Mercer.
The major categories of assets in the Plan at 30 September 2015, 30 September 2014 and 30 September 2013 and their fair values were: 2015 2014 2013 m m m Cash 0.4 0.9 0.4 Equity instruments 56.3 56.4 50.4 Debt instruments 25.7 24.0 22.1 Real estate 8.7 7.4 6.5 Total fair value of Plan assets 91.1 88.7 79.4 Present value of Plan liabilities 112.6 106.0 95.1 Deficit in the Plan 21.5 17.3 15.7 PAGE 218 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS At 30 September 2015 the Plan assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt investments.
The majority of the equities held by the Plan are in developed markets.
All investments of the Plan have quoted market prices in an active market, and are thus considered to be Level 1 financial instruments as defined by IFRS 13.
The movement in the fair value of the Plan assets during the year was as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 1 October 2014 88.7 79.4 Interest on Plan assets 3.6 3.7 Cash flows Contributions by Group 3.2 3.3 Contributions by Plan members 0.3 0.3 Benefits paid 2.2 1.4 Administration expenses paid 0.7 0.6 Remeasurement gain Return on Plan assets excluding amounts included in interest 1.8 4.0 At 30 September 2015 91.1 88.7 The actual return on Plan assets in the year ended 30 September 2015 was 1.8m 2014: 7.7m.
The movement in the present value of the Plan liabilities during the year was as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 1 October 2014 106.0 95.1 Current service cost 1.7 1.6 Interest expense 4.3 4.3 Cash flows Contributions by scheme members 0.3 0.3 Benefits paid 2.2 1.4 Remeasurement loss gain Arising from demographic assumptions - - Arising from financial assumptions 2.5 6.1 Arising from experience adjustments - - At 30 September 2015 112.6 106.0 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 219 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS The liabilities of the Plan are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the Plan using the Projected Unit method.
This amount is reflected in the liability in the balance sheet.
The Projected Unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Plan liabilities are calculated based on service up until the valuation date allowing for future salary growth until the date of retirement, withdrawal or death, as appropriate.
The future service rate is then calculated as the contribution rate required to fund the service accruing over the next year again allowing for future salary growth.
The major weighted average assumptions used by the actuary were in nominal terms : 30 September 30 September 30 September 2015 2014 2013 In determining net pension cost for the year Discount rate 4.10% 4.50% 4.60% Rate of compensation increase 3.65% 3.80% 3.65% Rate of price inflation 3.15% 3.30% 2.65% Rate of increase of pensions 3.05% 3.20% 2.55% In determining benefit obligations Discount rate 3.90% 4.10% 4.50% Rate of compensation increase 3.55% 3.65% 3.80% Rate of price inflation 3.05% 3.15% 3.30% Rate of increase of pensions 3.00% 3.05% 3.20% Further life expectancy at age 60 Male member aged 60 29 29 29 Female member aged 60 31 31 31 Male member aged 40 32 32 31 Female member aged 40 34 34 33 The amounts charged in the consolidated income statement in respect of the Plan are: Note 2015 2014 m m 14 Current service cost 1.7 1.6 Administration expenses 0.7 0.6 Included within operating expenses 2.4 2.2 Funding cost of defined benefit obligation 4.3 4.3 Interest on plan assets 3.6 3.7 11 Net interest expense 0.7 0.6 Components of defined benefit costs recognised in profit or loss 3.1 2.8 PAGE 220 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS The amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of the Plan are: Note 2015 2014 m m Return on Plan assets excluding amounts included in interest 1.8 4.0 Actuarial losses gains Arising from demographic assumptions - - Arising from financial assumptions 2.5 6.1 Arising from experience adjustments - - Total actuarial loss 4.3 2.1 23 Tax thereon 0.9 0.4 44 Net actuarial loss 3.4 1.7 c Defined benefit plan Future cash flows The sensitivity of the valuation of the defined benefit obligation to the principal assumptions disclosed above at 30 September 2015, calculating the obligation on the same basis as used in determining the IAS 19 value, is as follows: Assumption Increase in Impact on assumption scheme liabilities Discount rate 0.1% p. a.
2.3% decrease Rate of inflation 0.1% p. a.
0.5% increase Rate of salary growth 0.1% p. a.
1.9% increase Rates of mortality 1 year of life expectancy 2.0% increase maintaining a 1% real increase in salary growth The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of an actual future change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation as some of the assumptions will be correlated.
There has been no change in the method of preparing the analysis from that adopted in previous years.
In conjunction with the Trustee, the Group has continued to conduct asset-liability reviews of the Plan.
These studies are used to assist the Trustee and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the Plan.
The results of the studies are used to assist the Trustee in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the scheme deficit by providing information used to determine the investment strategy of the Plan.
There have been no changes in the processes by which the Plan manages its risks from previous periods.
The target asset allocations for the year ending 30 September 2016 are 62% growth assets primarily equities, 30% bonds and 8% real estate.
The rate of employee contributions to the Plan is 5.0% of pensionable salaries.
Before 8 October 2013 the agreed rate of employer contributions was 26.6% of gross salaries for participating employees with an additional contribution of 1.5m per annum paid by monthly instalments.
After 8 October 2013, following the finalisation of the March 2013 valuation, employer contributions rose to 27.0% of gross salaries for participating employees, the 1.5m per annum contribution remained in place and a further additional contribution of 0.4m per annum to cover administration and life cover was agreed.
The present best estimate of the contributions to be made to the Plan by the Group in the year ending 30 September 2016 is 3.2m.
