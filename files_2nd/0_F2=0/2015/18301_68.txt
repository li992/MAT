TAXATION Accounting policies Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due to temporary differences between accounting and tax treatments, and due to items that are never taxable or tax deductible.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
Once considered to be probable, tax benefits are reviewed each year to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
Tax provisions are included in current liabilities.
Interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
Full provision for deferred tax is made for temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their value for tax purposes.
The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected recoverable amount and is based on the expected manner of recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using the basis of taxation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realised in the future.
No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries where the group is able to control the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future, or where no liability would arise on the remittance.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The group is required to estimate the corporate tax in each of the many jurisdictions in which it operates.
The recognition of tax benefits and assessment of provisions against tax benefits requires management judgement.
In particular the group is routinely subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions, which by their nature are often complex and can take several years to resolve.
Provisions are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
However the actual tax liabilities could differ from the provision and in such event the group would be required to make an adjustment in a subsequent period which could have a material impact on the groups profit for the year.
The evaluation of deferred tax assets recoverability requires judgements to be made regarding the availability of future taxable income.

As a group operating in multiple countries, the actual tax rates applicable to profits in those countries are different from the UK tax rate.
The impact is shown in the table above as differences in overseas tax rates.
The groups worldwide business leads to the consideration of a number of important factors which may affect future tax charges, such as: the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms, acquisitions, disposals, restructuring activities, and settlements or agreements with tax authorities.
The group has a number of tax audits ongoing worldwide but does not currently expect material additional tax exposures to arise, above the amounts provided, as and when the audits are concluded.
