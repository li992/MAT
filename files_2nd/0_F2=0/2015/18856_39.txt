For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Groups dilutive ordinary shares comprise share options granted to employees under Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Retention Plan and shares and share options awarded under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan and Long Term Plan.
Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share are disclosed to show the results excluding the impact of exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax.
