However, we believe that our measure of underlying earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business as set out in note 17.
The key difference relates to the adjustments in respect of exceptional items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made limiting these to acquisition related costs and costs incurred on termination of derivative financial instruments.
A reconciliation of EPRA earnings per share to the Groups measure of underlying earnings per share is provided below.

However, we believe that our measure of NAV per share diluted, adjusted, as presented in note 18a, is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.
The key difference is the swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt which are excluded in the Groups definition of NAV per share diluted, adjusted.
The adjustment in respect of the non-controlling interest recoverable balance not recognised is due to historical accounting practices and is required, in our view, to give a more appropriate value of net assets attributable to equity owners of the Group.

As for earnings per share, the comparative number of shares have been adjusted to reflect the rights issue.
