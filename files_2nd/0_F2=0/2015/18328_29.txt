It includes a summary of financial performance by business unit 2.1, analysis of certain income statement items 2.22.5 and information regarding underlying earnings, distributable profits and dividends 2.62.8.
Further commentary regarding our trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected within EBITDA, can be found within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 55, with particular reference to key achievements and market conditions that have impacted our results.
2.1 Segmental reporting On 1 March 2015 the Group reorganised into three businesses with a dedicated management team for each: Generation: the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station: Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US: and Retail: the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the domestic heat market.
Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting.
Following the reorganisation, information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is organised into these three operating segments.
The measure ofprofit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA.
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment.
Unallocated costs are included within central operating costs.
Prior period comparatives have been restated to the extent the information is available.
Costs were entirely allocated to segments in previous periods.

Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management accounts.
However, spend on key capital projects is monitored.
Total spend onthe biomass transformation project during 2015 was 90 million 2014: 125 million, of which 22 million 2014: 85 million relates to construction of assets within the Biomass Supply segment.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies.
The revenue and results of all of our reporting segments are subject to seasonality with higher despatch and prices in the winter months, compared to summer months.
Intra-group trading Intra-group transactions are carried out on arms-length, commercial terms that where possible equate to market prices at the time ofthetransaction.
During 2015, the Biomass Supply segment sold wood pellets with a total value of 28.4 million 2014: nil to the Generation segment and the Generation segment sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of 863.2 million 2014: 735.2 million tothe Retail segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising 1.6 million at 31 December 2015, is eliminated onconsolidation.
Major customers Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 includes amounts of 597.7 million and 468.0 million 2014: 320.6 million and 288.7 million derived from two customers 2014: two customers, each representing 10% or more of the Groups revenue for the year.
These revenues arose in the Generation segment.

The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass and Billington Bioenergy and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of four cash-generating units CGUs.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or cash-generating unit value in use or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant fair value.
Whilst IFRS requires estimates of future cash flows to be discounted using a pre-tax rate, market rates are generally more widely available on a post-tax basis.
In utilising a post-tax discount rate, the Group takes account of its specific tax characteristics to ensure the impairment calculations are not affected.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount within the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit to the estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately withinthe income statement.
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually see note 5.2.
Impairment charges, as one-off items that are typically not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group in a given period, are excluded from underlying earnings see note 2.6.
Critical judgement areas During 2015, weak commodity markets and the removal of LEC income for the Generation business contributed to a substantial and sustained reduction in the Groups share price.
As a result, the market capitalisation of the Group fell materially below the carrying value of the Groups net assets, an indicator of possible impairment.
Accordingly a full impairment review was undertaken at the balance sheet date.
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions.
In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon managements reasonable estimates of future prices, output, costs and economic support for renewable energy generation.
The impairment methodology, calculations and the supporting assumptions were reviewed by the Audit Committee see page 72.
Thekey assumptions were benchmarked and calculation methodology assessed by an independent expert with relevant industry experience.
The most critical of these assumptions are discussed below.
Financials Drax Group plc 115 Annual report and accounts 2015 2.3 Impairment review and asset obsolescence charges continued Impairment review The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using a broad range of assumptions, including the expected economic life of its six power generating units, their fuel type and the regulatory regime under which they might operate.
This included key assumptions that each generating unit will be available for operation until 2039 consistent with the estimated asset life of the Drax Power Station, that the outcome of the ongoing EU State aid investigation into the CfD for the third unit conversion would be favourable with a strike price consistent with the initial decision published in January 2015 100 MWh and that, where required to support future renewable generation upon expiry of the current support mechanisms in 2027, a suitable level of economic incentive would be available to maintaincommercially acceptable returns.
When making these assumptions the enhancement value available from converting three of the generating units from their current coal fuel source to biomass was not included in the value in use results.
As a result, the majority of the CGUs longer term revenues are delivered by the biomass units.
Where available, estimates of future prices were based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties.
Transactions beyond contracted positions were valued using forward price curves and, beyond the liquid portion of observable market curves, thesewere constructed internally.
A benchmarking exercise confirmed that managements constructed curves were in line with marketconsensus.
The calculations were discounted using a post-tax nominal rate of 8%.
This indicated that the recoverable amount of each of the Groups CGUs exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment were required.
The calculations for each CGU are sensitive to the key assumptions described above.
Material adverse changes to these assumptions, particularly a delay in the EU State aid approval process or reduction in strike price for the CfD, the loss of existing economic support, the lack of adequate economic support for renewable generation post-2027 or any other evidence that the useful lives of assets may be materially shorter than assumed, could result in significant impairment charges in future periods.
Asset obsolescence charges Obsolescence charges have been recognised in 2015, in respect of specific assets as described below: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 000 000 Generation: Property, plant and equipment 102.6 Biomass Supply: Property, plant and equipment 6.6 Total asset obsolescence charges recognised in the income statement 109.2 Following an internal review and extensive testing, during 2015 it was concluded that Flue Gas Desulphurisation FGD technology was no longer required on converted biomass units within the Generation business and the assets were decommissioned.
The recoverable amount of these assets was determined to be zero and accordingly the full carrying amount of 92.6 million has been recognised as an asset obsolescence charge in the year.
During 2015 we began to install Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction technology across our generating units as part of our strategy to ensure compliance with the requirements of the IED.
As a result, development costs associated with a competing solution were determined to have a recoverable amount of zero, as the project would not be progressed.
The full carrying amount of 10.0 million has therefore been recognised as an asset obsolescence charge in the year.
Within the Biomass Supply business, following a decision not to proceed with a third pellet plant project in the US Gulf, the recoverable amount of the associated assets was determined to be zero and the full carrying amount of 6.6 million recognised as an asset obsolescence charge.
116 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 2: Financial Performance continued 2.4 Net finance costs Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure such as interest payable on our bank loans as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives see note 5.3 and net interest charged on the Groups defined benefit pension scheme obligation see note 6.3.
These are offset by interest income that we generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses for example through investment in money market funds.

2.5 Current and deferred taxation The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the estimated amount payable on this years taxable profits which areadjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
The tax charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on taxable profit for the year in the relevant jurisdiction.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items income or expense that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities inthefinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In the Summer Budget 2015, the UK corporation tax main rate has been set by the Finance Act at 19% for the years starting 1 April 2017, 2018 and 2019 and at 18% for the year starting 1 April 2020.
These rates have therefore been reflected in the deferred tax balances shown below.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Significant judgement areas In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
TheGroup believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Where such assets relate to losses incurred by abusiness unit, particularly those with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

In both cases the business units involved have a history of making losses and until sufficient operational performance is established and maintained to give suitable confidence in future profitability, taxable income against which to utilise the benefit of the accumulated losses is not considered to be probable.
2.6 Earnings per share and underlying earnings per share Earnings per share EPS represents the amount of our earnings post-tax profits that are attributable to each ordinary share we have inissue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during theyear.
Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options such as those to be issued under our employee share schemes see note 6.2, that are currently expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated note 2.7.
Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of unrealised gains on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence charges and the one-off settlement of CESP in 2014 from earnings.
Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for the period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m Earnings: Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings 56.3 128.7 Adjusted for: Unrealised gains on derivative contracts 123.7 65.8 CESP settlement 20.0 Asset obsolescence charges 109.2 Tax impact of the above 4.2 13.1 Underlying earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company 46.0 96.0 Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share millions 406.0 404.4 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares under share plans 1.3 2.9 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share millions 407.3 407.3 Earnings per share basic pence 14 32 Earnings per share diluted pence 14 32 Underlying earnings per share basic pence 11 24 Underlying earnings per share diluted pence 11 24 Financials Drax Group plc 119 Annual report and accounts 2015 2.7 Dividends Dividends are amounts we return to our shareholders and are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.

The immediate cash resources of the Group are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.5.
The majority of these cash resources are held by the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group, in particular Drax Power Limited.
The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 146 to 151 of this report, disclose the Parent Companys distributable reserves of 222 million.
Following a reorganisation of the subsidiary companies undertaken during the year described in note 4 to the Parent Company financial statements the wider Group has, relative to previous dividend payments note 2.7, sufficient retained profits available for future distributions in accordance with the Group divided policy.
120 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 3: Operating Assets and Working Capital This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.
3.1 Property, plant and equipment This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to generate revenue.
The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset.
Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset.
An assets net book value is its cost less any depreciation including impairment, if required charged to date.
Additions in 2015 include a further 90 million 2014: 125 million on our biomass transformation project, which is now largely complete and in line with initial expectations on timing and overall cost.
At Drax Power Station we now have two fully converted units running on biomass fuel with a third operating as an enhanced co-fired unit burning up to 90% biomass.
Upstream, in our US-based wood pellet manufacturing business, both pellet plant facilities and the port facility commenced commercial operations during the year.
Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating inthe manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment invalue.
We construct many of our assets ourselves as part of long-term development projects.
Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station.
The table below shows the range of useful lives and the average useful life of an asset in the main categories of asset we own in years: UEL range Freehold buildings 1432 Plant and machinery Electricity generation plant 232 Pellet production plant 525 Other plant 230 Decommissioning asset 35 Plant spare parts Up to 35 Freehold land, held at cost, is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.
Within the plant and machinery categories shorter lives are attributed to assets that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling outage cycles.
Within the Electricity generation plant category the majority of the remaining net book value relates to assets with UELs greater than 25 years.
Within the pellet production plant category the majority of the remaining net book value relates to assets with UELs greater than 20 years.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear.
Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met: namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Critical judgement areas Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment see note 2.3 where there has been a trigger event that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on managements reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore subjective.
Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence: however an inherent degree of judgement remains.
Financials Drax Group plc 121 Annual report and accounts 2015 3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may be impaired.
Accounting policies in respect of impairment, along with full details of the impairment reviews conducted during 2015, are set out in note 2.3.
Plant and equipment includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at 31 December 2015 of 1.6 million 2014:1.3 million.
Additions during the year include 1.9 million 2014: 3.4 million of capitalised borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction ofspecific assets.
122 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 3: Operating Assets and Working Capital continued 3.2 ROC and LEC assets We earn ROC and LEC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets Ofgem, as a result of burning renewable biomass to generate electricity.
This note sets out the value of such assets we have earned but not yet sold.
As we generate more of our electricity by burning renewable biomass, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC assets we generate will increase.
Haven Power provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs.
Following the governments decision to remove the CCL exemption for power generated from renewable sources, as of 1 August 2015 we no longer earn LECs for electricity generated from renewable biomass.
The remaining balance sheet value of LECs represents LECs earned before 1 August 2015 which are yet to be sold to customers.
We expect to recover the carrying amount of these LECs in full in 2016.
Accounting policy ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based onanticipated sales prices.
The value of ROCs and LECs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs inthatperiod.
Where our retail activities incur an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred.
At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC and LEC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales prices including, where relevant, agreed forward sale contracts and taking into account likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our own ROC obligations.
Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.
Critical judgement areas The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs and LECs referred to above are calculated with reference to assumptions regarding future sales prices in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate.
Historic experience indicates that the assumptions used in the valuation arereasonable: however actual sales prices may differ.
ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the recycle fund at the end of the compliance period, where Supplier buy out charges incurred by Suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations are returned torenewable generators on a pro-rata basis.
Such estimates are subject to assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and thus subject to some uncertainty.
The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to itsown forecasts in calculating these estimates.
Past experience indicates the values arrived at are reasonable but remain subject to possible variation.
Financials Drax Group plc 123 Annual report and accounts 2015 3.3 Inventories We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity, and raw materials used in the production of compressed wood pellets.
This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.
Accounting policy Our fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism and transport handling costs.
Critical judgement areas Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, given the storage and handling characteristics of coal and biomass, an element of judgement is inherent in calculating the volume of fuel stocks on site at any given time.
Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving around or exiting sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry standards.
Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to provide closing stock volumes, with the most prudent valuation adopted in preparing financial statements.
Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error.
Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist, with a provision made where the survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above.
Despite being an independent process, the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.
The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage.
On-site biomass is stored in sealed domes with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes.
Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.
However, this survey remains subject to a tolerable error range.
Experience indicates that the estimates and assumptions made by management in calculating stock volumes are reasonable.
However, the level of judgement and tolerable error range involved means that actual values may differ from initial calculations.
As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m Coal 89.4 144.6 Biomass 118.7 81.0 Other fuels and consumables 15.9 16.8 224.0 242.4 The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2015 was 1,306.9 million 2014: 1,224.8 million.
3.4 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for.
Other receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group for which we are yet to receive the relevant goods or services in return e. g. insurance premiums we have paid for in advance that will be utilised within the year.
Accounting policy Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.

At 31 December 2015, the Group had amounts receivable from two 2014: four significant counterparties within the generation business, representing 41% 2014: 68% of trade receivables, both of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms.
Of total trade receivables at 31 December 2015, 41 million 2014: 34 million relates to retail power sales.
The risk profile of retail debt isdifferent from that of the generation business with a larger volume of counterparties, and hence a lower concentration of credit risk, with different payment terms.
All past-due receivables are assessed against the Groups credit risk policies for indicators of impairment and provisions made where appropriate.
The value of retail debts that are past-due and not provided against, in accordance with this assessment, is not material.
Accordingly, management does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of 4.9 million 2014: 6.8 million.
This provision, which largely relates to retail receivables, has been determined with reference to past default experiences in line with our policies.
Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m At 1 January 6.8 5.6 Receivables written off 5.0 0.9 Provision for receivables impairment 3.1 2.1 At 31 December 4.9 6.8 3.5 Trade and other payables Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers for goods and services provided, tax authorities and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business.
We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in thefuture as a result of our activities in the current year e. g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced.
Accounting policy Trade and other payables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost.
As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m Amounts falling due within one year: Trade payables 41.7 49.1 Fuel accruals 131.4 135.8 Other accruals 260.8 234.3 Other payables 54.1 49.1 488.0 468.3 The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU ETS.
Accruals at 31 December 2015 include 10.0 million 2014: 12.2 million with respect to the Groups estimated net liability to deliver CO emissions 2 allowances.
Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.

As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m Cash and cash equivalents 133.8 180.9 4.3 Short-term investments Short-term investments represent cash held on deposit with financial institutions with a maturity of greater than three months at inception.
As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m Short-term investments 40.1 4.4 Borrowings Our financing structure includes 325 million of term loans, comprised of a private placement of 100 million with various funds managed by M&G Investments, a 75 million amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, a 50 million amortising term loan with Green Investment Bank and a 100 million amortising term loan facility with M&G UK Companies Financing Fund.
The loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025.
All of the term loans were fully drawn down at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
In December 2015 we successfully refinanced our 400 million revolving credit facility.
The new facility matures in December 2019 and has a margin of 175 basis points over LIBOR.
At 31 December 2015 this facility had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of 37.9 million see note 7.5.
At the same time we also renewed our commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades without the requirement to post collateral.
Accounting policy The Group measures all debt instruments whether financial assets or financial liabilities initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value of the consideration paid or received.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement overthe life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
Analysis of borrowings Borrowings at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against bank loans.

128 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 5: Other Assets and Liabilities This section includes all other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, not covered inother sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.
5.1 Acquisitions On 4 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Billington Bioenergy Limited Billington Bioenergy, obtaining control of the company.
Billington Bioenergy is a wood pellet distributor in the UK renewable-fuelled heating market.
It gives us an important opportunity to work with the UK heat sector to ensure that the many benefits of biomass are fully understood.
We hope to drive substantial growth in this market over the coming years.
Accounting policy Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred and theassets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable netassets acquired.
The provisional amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy are as set out in the table below: m Financial assets 0.6 Inventory 0.3 Property, plant and equipment 0.9 Financial liabilities 1.6 Total identifiable net assets 0.2 Goodwill 3.8 Total consideration paid in cash 4.0 The acquisition consideration of 4.0 million was settled entirely in cash, with no deferred or contingent consideration payable.
No cash or cash equivalents were acquired, therefore the net cash outflow on acquisition was 4.0 million.
Billington Bioenergy contributed revenues of 4.7 million and EBITDA of nil to the results of the Group in the period between the acquisition date and the balance sheet date.
5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business, when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired.
Our goodwill relates to the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 and Billington Bioenergy in 2015.
Other intangibles include any amounts paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.
Accounting policy Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that cash-generating unit assessed.
Goodwill Carbon Total m m m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2014 10.7 26.5 37.2 Utilisation 26.5 26.5 Additions at cost At 1 January 2015 10.7 10.7 Additions at cost 3.8 11.8 15.6 At 31 December 2015 14.5 11.8 26.3 Goodwill Total goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2015 was 14.5 million, with 10.7 million arising on the acquisition of Haven Power attributed to Haven Power and 3.8 million arising on the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy in the period 31 December 2014: 10.7 million entirely attributable to Haven Power Limited.
At 31 December 2015, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value reflecting the economic benefits from Haven Powers cash generative profile.
Financials Drax Group plc 129 Annual report and accounts 2015 5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of Haven Power is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions in this calculation are the same as those used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2015 and are disclosed in note 2.3.
Given the short time since the acquisition, management consider the fair value of Billington Bioenergy to be equivalent to the purchase price, which was supported by an independent valuation.
Carbon assets Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the current financial 2 year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.
5.3 Provisions We make a provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and remediating the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets.
The amount represents the present value i. e. it is discounted to reflect the time value of money of the expected costs.
Provisions are for liabilities of uncertain timing and or amount, and as such by their nature are estimated.
Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
No allowance is made within the provision for expected proceeds on disposal of scrap or assets to third parties, as the uncertainty over market prices at the estimated decommissioning date mean such an asset would not be virtually certain at the balance sheet date.
The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built in risks specific to the liability.
An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Reinstatement m Carrying amount: At 1 January 2014 32.4 Impact of triennial revaluation see below 3.7 Unwinding of discount 1.1 At 1 January 2015 29.8 Unwinding of discount 0.7 At 31 December 2015 30.5 The initial provision and subsequent estimation changes are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and are being depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs note 2.4.
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis.
The most recent update took place in 2014.
130 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 6: Our People The notes in this section relate to the remuneration of our directors and employees, including disclosures relating to our obligations under retirement benefit schemes.

We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Accounting policy All of the Groups share-based payments are equity-settled.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.
Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m BMP 3.7 5.2 SAYE 1.6 0.7 5.3 5.9 Share Incentive Plan SIP Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to 1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year.

A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Groups TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard.
The fair value of the 2015, 2014 and 2013 BMP awards, of 3.3 million, 5.4 million and 6.1million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the corresponding three year vesting periods.

Additional information in relation to the Groups share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.
6.3 Retirement benefit obligations We operate a defined benefit and three defined contribution pension schemes.
The Drax Power Group section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme: a pension arrangement underwhich participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules.
Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.
The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401 K Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the scheme.
132 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 6: Our People continued 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Accounting policy Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the contributions.
For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable and the return on scheme assets excluding interest, is recognised immediately inthe balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs.
Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised within the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur.
The net interest expense is recognised within finance costs.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
Significant judgement areas Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually andmodified as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonablebased on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ fromsuch assumptions.
The assumptions used in 2015 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent actuarial advice received.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates three defined contribution schemes, The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass inc. 401 K Plan, for all qualifying employees.
Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m Total included in staff costs note 6.1 5.9 4.9 As at 31 December 2015, contributions of 0.4 million 2014: 0.4 million due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit scheme The Drax Power Group DPG section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS.
Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be: Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets equities, property and direct lending which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long-term objectives.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the schemes liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect against extreme inflation.
Other risks include operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits, legislative risks such as the government increasing theburden on pension schemes through new legislation and other demographic risks such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group.
The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension.
Financials Drax Group plc 133 Annual report and accounts 2015 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2013.
Futurevaluations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.
The next valuation will therefore take place on or before 31 March 2016.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to 31 December 2015, taking into account experience over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows: As at 31 December 2015 2014 % p. a.
Discount rate 3.9 3.7 Inflation RPI 3.1 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 2.8 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.7 3.6 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2015 at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years 2014: 27 years after retirement if they are male andfor a further 29 years 2014: 29 years after retirement if they are female.
Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 28 years and 31 years respectively 2014: 28 years and 31 years respectively.
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value ofthe plan assets, determined as follows: As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m Defined benefit obligation 244.6 242.1 Fair value of plan assets 215.1 207.8 Net liability recognised in the balance sheet 29.5 34.3 The amounts recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs, are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m Included in staff costs note 6.1 : Current service cost 6.4 6.2 Past service cost Total included in other operating and administrative expenses 6.4 6.2 Included in finance costs note 2.4 : Interest on net defined benefit liability 1.1 1.5 Total included in finance costs 1.1 1.5 Total amounts recognised in the income statement 7.5 7.7 Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m Cumulative actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme at 1 January 72.0 75.4 Actuarial gains on defined benefit pension scheme recognised in the year 1.2 3.4 Cumulative losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December 70.8 72.0 134 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 6: Our People continued 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 242.1 220.9 Current and past service cost 6.4 6.2 Employee contributions 0.2 0.2 Interest cost 8.9 9.8 Actuarial gains losses 5.8 10.2 Benefits paid 7.2 5.2 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 244.6 242.1 The actuarial gains of 5.8 million 2014: 10.2 million losses reflect 2.3 million 2014: losses of 12.3 million gains arising from changes in financial assumptions, 1.8 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions and scheme experience of 1.7 million 2014: gains of 0.5 million and 1.6 million respectively.

The actual return on plan assets in the period was 3.2 million 2014: 21.9 million.
The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows: As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m 1 Equities 64.6 77.8 2 Fixed interest bonds 113.9 100.5 Property 27.9 25.9 Hedge funds 0.0 0.4 3 Cash and other assets 8.7 3.2 Fair value of total plan assets 215.1 207.8 Notes: 1 Under the Groups long-term asset strategy, 50% of assets are invested in return generating asset classes of which 5% is invested in emerging market equity.
The remaining 50% of assets are invested in liability-matching asset classes.
2 Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, government and absolute return bonds.
8% has a sub-investment grade credit rating i. e. BB or lower.
3 Other assets include 8.0 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market.
Financials Drax Group plc 135 Annual report and accounts 2015 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets arestudied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to theactual asset allocation for the scheme.
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit.
The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity ofthe pension deficit at 31 December 2015 to changes in these assumptions: Decrease Increase in net liability % m Discount rate Increase 0.25 11.3 Decrease 0.25 12.2 1 Inflation rate Increase 0.25 10.6 Decrease 0.25 10.0 Life expectancy Increase 1 year 6.8 Decrease 1 year 6.8 Note: 1 The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation.
The impact of corresponding decreases in these variables is includedhere.
The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the liabilities, is currently 22 years.
The Group expects to contribute 8.3 million to its pension plans during the 12 months ended 31 December 2016.
The Group intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the last triennial valuation, over the period to 31 December 2019.
136 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 7: Risk Management This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.
7.1 Risk management disclosures The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the risk management committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties page 52 which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with the Groups trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO emissions allowances.
Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the 2 financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO emissions allowances when profitable to do so.
2 Allcommitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources.
All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.
The Group purchases CO emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and 2 international sources.
All commitments to purchase CO emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow 2 hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO emissions allowances.
2 Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance sheet date.
The analysis is based on the Groups commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease increase by 6.7 million 2014: decrease increase by 9.4 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to oil derivatives: and the hedge reserve would decrease increase by 11.5 million 2014: decrease increase by 12.0 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.
Interest rate risk Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities.
The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date: however this risk management tool remains available to the Group.
Information about the Groups instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided below.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit after tax and net assets for the year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease increase by 1.8 million 2014: decrease increase by 1.4 million as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases inUS dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, and CO emissions allowances purchases in Euros.
As our biomass transformation plans have 2 progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease increase by 233.3 million 241.1 million 2014: decrease increase by 261.0 million 275.3 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts: and other equity reserves would increase decrease by 67.8 million 75.0 million 2014: increase decrease by 48.7 million 53.9 million as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Financials Drax Group plc 137 Annual report and accounts 2015 7.1 Risk management disclosures continued Liquidity risk The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on our term loans was 4.22% 2014: 4.21%.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market, based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows.
Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date.

If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and or fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers.
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.
138 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 7: Risk Management continued 7.1 Risk management disclosures continued Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, assummarised below: As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 133.8 180.9 Short-term investments 40.1 Trade and other receivables 324.2 375.5 Derivative financial instruments 609.2 250.3 1,067.2 846.8 Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of 4.9 million 2014: 6.8 million.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees.
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral.
In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies.
These policies manage credit riskexposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity excluding the hedge reserve, plus net cash.
Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.4, cash and cash equivalents in note 4.2 and short-term investments in note 4.3.
As at 31 December 2015 2014 m m Borrowings 320.4 319.6 Cash and cash equivalents 133.8 180.9 Short-term investments 40.1 Net debt 186.6 98.6 Total shareholders equity, excluding hedge reserve 1,567.5 1,556.2 7.2 Derivative financial instruments We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO emissions allowances to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial contracts 2 principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives to fix sterling cash flows.
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price risk, and foreign currency risk see note 7.1.
A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model.
Our policy is to lock down exposures to commodity price movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above.
This strategy aims to fide-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future.
At the balance sheet date all contracts subject to certain exemptions described below must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS see note 7.4.
Accounting policy Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting.
This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO emissions allowances 2 and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes infair value reflected through the hedge reserve note 7.4 to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met.
Financials Drax Group plc 139 Annual report and accounts 2015 7.2 Derivative financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.
The location of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in 2015 are summarised in the table below: Gains losses on Accounting treatment for gains losses Accounting for derivative contracts contracts in 2015 in the consolidated financial statements Commodity contracts Power 13.6 million Hedge reserve Coal from international sources 4.2 million Income statement Coal from domestic sources n a Own-use exemption Biomass n a Own-use exemption CO emissions allowances 6.8 million Hedge reserve 2 Gas 53.9 million Income statement Financial contracts Foreign currency exchange contracts 106.1 million Income statement 31.3 million Hedge reserve Financial coal 6.8 million Income statement 14.7 million Hedge reserve Financial oil and other financial products 38.9 million Income statement Total net gains in hedge reserve 23.4 million Total net gains in income statement 123.7 million Critical judgement areas The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates.
The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model.
Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements.
The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
Fair value accounting Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO emissions allowances, financial 2 coal, financial oil, gas collectively Commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value as follows: As at 31 December 2015 As at 31 December 2014 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Commodity contracts: Less than one year 264.1 226.1 132.9 97.4 More than one year but not more than two years 81.2 94.1 44.8 55.0 More than two years 27.0 53.4 8.4 45.0 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts: Less than one year 66.7 48.2 6.2 33.3 More than one year but not more than two years 93.8 81.7 28.1 40.2 More than two years 76.4 70.9 29.9 92.0 Total 609.2 574.4 250.3 362.9 Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts 108.2 147.5 53.2 100.0 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 170.2 152.6 58.0 132.2 Total non-current portion 278.4 300.1 111.2 232.2 Current portion 330.8 274.3 139.1 130.7 140 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Section 7: Risk Management continued 7.2 Derivative financial instruments continued The total movement in the fair value of these contracts of 147.1 million 2014: 166.2 million loss is recognised in the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 123.7 65.8 Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the hedge reserve note 7.4 23.4 100.4 Total unrealised gains losses on derivative contracts 147.1 166.2 Unrealised gains in the income statement in 2015 are primarily the result of changes in the fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts.
We maintain a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in foreign currencies, principally denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
The high volume of contracts held demonstrated in the table on page 137 means low levels of exchange rate volatility can have a significant impact on amounts recognised in our income statement in respect of these contracts.
The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US dollars.
The overall strengthening of the US dollar against sterling during 2015 resulted in further significant unrealised gains in the current year.
During 2015 the liquid portion of the forward power curve contracted and as a result we extended the use of longer-dated contracts to sell gas as a proxy for power hedging.
Whilst the correlation is strong, the hedge is not perfect and thus we do not apply hedge accounting to these contracts.
Falling market gas prices during 2015 have contributed further gains to the income statement as our hedged positions are at a price that is better than could be achieved in the market as at the balance sheet date.
These gains were partially offset by unrealised losses on our financial oil purchase contracts as a result of the continuing decline in oil prices during 2015.
We utilise financial contracts to fix oil indexation in fuel purchase contracts.
Unrealised gains recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39 and forward contracts for the sale of power which have increased in value relative to the market as price weakness continued in 2015.
Fair value measurement Commodity contracts fair value The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not excluded through the own use exemption, are calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Other financial contracts fair value The fair value of other financial contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives.
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of both commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price: therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
Financials Drax Group plc 141 Annual report and accounts 2015 7.3 Other financial instruments We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising from our operations.
Accounting policy Cash and cash equivalents note 4.2, short-term investments note 4.3, trade and other receivables note 3.4, and trade and other payables note 3.5 generally have short times to maturity.
For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value.
The Groups borrowings note 4.4 relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.
7.4 Hedge reserve Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature, and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.
As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging: however not all of these contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39.
The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective hedge are recognised in the income statement.
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges.
Atthe inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Changes infair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they areeffective.
Years ended 31 December 2015 2014 m m At 1 January 16.4 63.9 Gains losses recognised: Commodity contracts 41.4 48.1 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 27.7 37.1 Released from equity: Commodity contracts 49.2 8.1 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 3.5 7.1 Related deferred tax, net note 2.5 4.9 20.1 At 31 December 34.9 16.4 The Groups cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts principally commitments to sell power and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract.
Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss.
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.

Theamount and timing of any payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.
Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP The UK government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males.
Thiswould correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group note 6.3.
At present, the methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured.
As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.
Borrowings In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group.
As at 31 December 2015 the Groups contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to 37.9 million 2014: 50.5 million.
Invoices subject to dispute resolution At the balance sheet date, the Group was engaged in a commercial dispute resolution process relating to certain invoices received for the year ending 31 December 2015.
No entries have been made in the financial statements in respect of these items as the existence and value of any potential liability remains uncertain.
Under the terms of our contract the Group is entitled to withhold payment until the dispute is resolved.
7.6 Commitments We have a number of financial commitments i. e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future that are not recorded in our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery.
Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.
