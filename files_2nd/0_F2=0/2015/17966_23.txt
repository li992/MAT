Financial statements | Notes to the Company financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Basis of preparation Bunzl plc the 'Company' is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006.
In the transition to FRS 101 from existing UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice GAAP, the Company has applied International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards while ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101.
An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101 has affected the reported financial position and performance of the Company is provided in Note 15.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a cash flow statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries and also in respect of capital management: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: an additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy: and disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of Bunzl plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: certain disclosures required by IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payments: and certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments.
2 Accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS 101 balance sheet at 1 January 2014 for the purposes of the transition to FRS 101. a Tangible fixed assets All tangible fixed assets are included at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Short leasehold improvements The lower of 50 years and the life of the related lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment 310 years Assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
b Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
c Share based payments The Company operates a number of equity settled share based payment compensation plans.
Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and the Directors remuneration report.
The total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date calculated using a valuation model which is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share based payment charge recognised in its consolidated financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
The expense is not recharged to the relevant subsidiaries.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 125 Financial statements | Notes to the Company financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued d Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising between tax bases and carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the forseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
e Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
f Retirement benefits i Defined contribution pension schemes A defined contribution pension scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate fund and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
ii Defined benefit pension scheme A defined benefit pension scheme is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution pension scheme.
The defined benefit pension scheme is recognised on the balance sheet as a defined benefit pension asset or defined benefit pension liability based on the difference between the fair value of pension scheme assets and the present value of pension scheme liabilities.
The present value of pension scheme liabilities are calculated by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted using the rate applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity and currency to the pension scheme liabilities.
The fair value of any pension scheme assets at bid price are deducted from the present value of pension scheme liabilities to determine the net deficit or surplus of the scheme.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit pension schemes comprise actuarial gains and losses of pension scheme liabilities and the actual return on pension scheme assets excluding amounts already included in net interest.
The net actuarial gain or loss for the year is recorded in full in other comprehensive income.
Current service cost, past service cost or gain and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to profit for the period.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested.
Net interest on the net defined benefit pension liability or asset is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension scheme deficit or surplus at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset at the beginning of the year.
Net interest is recorded within profit or loss for the period.
When the valuation of a defined benefit pension scheme results in a surplus, the recognised defined benefit asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the pension scheme or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
The Company is the sponsoring company of the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated Group policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to participating subsidiaries, the net defined benefit pension cost or benefit is recognised fully by the Company.
The contributions paid by the participating subsidiaries other than the Company are credited to profit or loss of the Company where the amounts relate to service and are independent of the number of years of service, or to other comprehensive income if not linked to service.
g Investment in own shares The cost of shares held either directly treasury shares or indirectly employee benefit trust shares is deducted from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised in retained earnings.
At each reporting date the Company remeasures the value of shares held in the employee benefit trust to present them in own shares reserve at the market value of those shares at the reporting date.
This is done through a reclassification from retained earnings to the own share reserve.
This movement has no effect on the actual number of shares held by the employee benefit trust.
126 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements | Notes to the Company financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued h Dividends The interim dividend is included in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
i Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
j Leases Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the choice and application of the Companys accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and profit or loss.
Actual results may differ from those derived from the application of such judgements, estimates and assumptions, in particular those which involve anticipating future events.
Accordingly, the judgements, estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with the impact of any revisions considered necessary being recognised prospectively thereafter.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have most risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are noted below and explained more fully in the referenced Notes.
The directors believe that the judgements, estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of these financial statements are appropriate.
Where relevant and practicable, sensitivity analysis is disclosed in the relevant Notes to demonstrate the impact of changes in estimates or assumptions used.
a Recoverability of investments The carrying amounts of the Companys non-financial assets, including investments in subsidiary undertakings, are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amounts of assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and their value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount with impairment losses being recognised in profit or loss.
b Defined benefit pension schemes The measurement of the present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities involves the use of various actuarial assumptions, the selection of which is judgemental.
The Company uses independent actuarial experts to assist with the measurement of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities but the actual liabilities could be materially different.
The main risks to which the Company is exposed in relation to the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes are described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
The judgement made in relation to the application of IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, is described in Note 9.

Amounts related to liquidation of dormant companies have been restated to reflect historic disposals of investments which had been fully provided against, with no net impact to the net investment balance.
5 Deferred tax asset Recognised deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities are attributable to the following: Defined benefit Share based Net deferred pension scheme payments Other tax asset m m m m 1 January 2014 2.6 1.6 0.2 4.4 Recognised in profit or loss 0.1 0.1 Recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 0.8 0.1 0.7 31 December 2014 1 January 2015 3.4 1.5 0.1 5.0 Recognised in profit or loss 0.1 0.1 Recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 4.4 0.3 4.1 31 December 2015 1.0 1.8 0.2 1.0 Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method.
Following the enactment of legislation in the UK, the corporation tax rate will be reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% from 1 April 2020.
Accordingly, the UK tax rate used for measuring deferred tax reflects the rate expected to be applied when the temporary differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset as they both relate to the same tax jurisdiction and will be settled on a net basis.
It is probable that the deferred tax assets recognised will be realised.
The recovery of the net deferred tax asset will be over more than one year.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 70.6m 2014: 70.5m.

9 Retirement benefits The Company operates a number of retirement benefit schemes in the UK, including both a defined benefit and a defined contribution scheme.
A description of the characteristics and risks to which the Company is exposed in relation to the UK defined benefit pension scheme is detailed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
Financial information The amounts included in the financial statements related to the defined benefit pension scheme at 31 December were: 2015 2014 Amounts included in profit for the year m m Current service cost net of contributions by employees 2.5 2.3 Net interest expense 0.5 0.4 Contributions paid by participating subsidiaries 1.3 1.4 Total charge to profit for the year 1.7 1.3 Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 3.8 29.9 Experience gain on pension scheme liabilities 6.3 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of pension scheme liabilities 16.0 38.2 Actuarial gain loss on defined benefit pension scheme 18.5 8.3 Contributions paid by participating subsidiaries not linked to service 4.6 4.6 Total credit charge to other comprehensive income 23.1 3.7 The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benefits were: 2015 2014 Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years 22.6 22.6 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years 24.3 24.4 2015 2014 Rate of increase in salaries 3.5% 3.8% Rate of increase in pensions 3.0% 3.0% Discount rate 3.9% 3.7% Inflation rate 2.1% 2.1% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The increase decrease that would arise on the defined benefit pension asset as at 31 December 2015 as a result of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions was: Impact of change Impact of change in inflation rate in discount rate 0.25% 0.25% 0.25% 0.25% m m m m Increase decrease in defined benefit pension asset 8.0 5.5 12.1 12.9 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 129 Financial statements | Notes to the Company financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued 9 Retirement benefits continued The market value of scheme assets and the present value of retirement benefit obligations at 31 December were: 2015 2014 m m Equities 94.7 88.9 Bonds 181.7 181.4 Other 0.3 0.7 Total market value of pension scheme assets 276.7 271.0 Present value of funded obligations 271.3 288.1 Defined benefit pension scheme surplus deficit 5.4 17.1 Deferred tax liability asset 1.0 3.4 Total net surplus deficit after tax 4.4 13.7 In accordance with IFRIC 14, the surplus on the UK defined benefit pension scheme is recognised as a defined benefit pension asset because the Company considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus from the pension scheme.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 131 Financial statements | Notes to the Company financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued 15 Explanation of transition to FRS 101 from previously applied UK GAAP As stated in Note 1, these are the Companys first financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
The accounting policies set out in Note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 and in the preparation of the opening FRS 101 balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 the Companys date of transition.
In preparing its FRS 101 balance sheet, the Company has adjusted amounts reported previously in its financial statements prepared in accordance with its previous basis of accounting UK GAAP.
The table below shows the quantum of these adjustments to the previously disclosed figures for 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2014.

Previously, under UK GAAP, a multi-employer exemption was applied which meant that the deficit on the pension scheme was not recorded on the balance sheet of any of the participating employer companies.
As the Company is the sponsoring company for the pension scheme and as there is no contractual agreement or stated Group policy for charging the net defined benefit pension scheme cost to participating subsidiaries, the cost or benefit of the pension scheme and the closing deficit or surplus on the defined benefit pension scheme is recognised fully by the Company.
The accounting valuation is consistent between the Company and the Group as described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
A deferred tax asset has also been recorded on the newly recognised defined benefit pension liability as well as in relation to certain share based payment arrangements for the Companys employees.
