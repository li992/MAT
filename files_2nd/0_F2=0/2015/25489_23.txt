Derecognition Transfer of financial assets that do not result in derecognition The group has been party to securitisation transactions whereby assets continue to be recognised on balance sheet either fully or partially although they have been subject to legal transfer to another entity.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction.

Restatements The group has adopted the following new or revised standards from 1 April 2014: IFRIC 21 Levies The group has adopted IFRIC 21 Levies from 1 April 2014.
The interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy and an entity does not have a constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered in a future period as a result of being economically compelled to continue to operate in that future period.
The new interpretation has been applied retrospectively and its application has caused the recognition date for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme levy in the UK to be changed from 31December prior to the beginning of the relevant levy year, to the following 1 April.
The group has accordingly restated the prior periods to reflect this change.
The impact in the year to 31March2013 is a decrease in operating costs and other liabilities of 4.7million and an increase in taxation on operating profit before goodwill and deferred taxation liabilities of 1.0 million.
The net impact on retained income at 31March 2014 is an increase of 2.8 million.
