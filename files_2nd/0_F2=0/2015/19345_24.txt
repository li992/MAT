Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Note 1 General Playtech plc and its subsidiaries the Group develop unified software platforms for the online and land-based gambling industry, targeting online and land-based operators and since May 2015 also offered an online trading platform to retail customer which enabled them to trade CFD Contracts for Differences on a variety of instruments which fall under the general categories of Foreign exchange, Commodities, Equities and indices.
In the context of this activity, the Group acts as a market-maker in a, predominantly, B2C environment.
Playtechs gaming applications online casino, poker and other P2P games, bingo, mobile, live gaming, land-based terminal and fixed-odds game are fully inter-compatible and can be freely incorporated as stand-alone applications, accessed and funded by the operators players through the same user account and managed by the operator by means of a single, powerful management interface.
Basis of preparation The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
Note 2 Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial information, on a consistent basis, are: Accounting principles This financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting standards and interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
In the current year the Group has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB, as they have been adopted by the European Union, that are relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2015.
New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 January 2015 There are no new standards, interpretations or amendments which are effective for periods beginning on or before 1 January 2015 which have a material effect on the Groups financial information.
The Directors are still considering the potential impact of IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers, and IFRS 16: Leases, but do not expect that these or any other new standards, interpretations and amendments which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2015 to have a material effect on the Groups future financial information.
Basis of consolidation Where the company has control over an investee it is classified as a subsidiary.
The company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee: exposure to variable returns from the investee: and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
The consolidated financial information presents the results of the Group as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
In the statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
94 | Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Note 2 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency The financial information of the gaming division, which includes the Company and some of its subsidiaries is prepared in euros the functional currency, which is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the gaming division.
Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are converted into euros in accordance with the principles set forth by International Accounting Standard IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Accordingly, transactions and balances have been converted into the presentation currency of euros as follows: Monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date: Income and expense items at exchange rates applicable as of the date of recognition of those items.
Non-monetary items are converted at the rate of exchange used to convert the related balance sheet items i. e. at the time of the transaction.
Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The financial information of the financial division is prepared in US Dollars the functional currency, which is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the financial division.
The transactions and balances are converted into the presentation currency of euros as follows: Assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date: Income and expense items at average exchange rates applicable at the period of recognition of those items: Equityat historic rate.
Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the foreign exchange reserve.
Revenue recognition The Groups principal revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below: Royalty income Royalty income relating to licensed technology and the provision of certain services provided via various distribution channels online, mobile or land-based interfaces.
Royalty income is based on the underlying gaming revenue earned by our licensees and is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Trading income Trading income represents gains including commission and losses arising on client trading activity, primarily in contracts for difference on shares, indexes, commodities and foreign exchange.
Open client positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue as well as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
Fixed-fee income Other revenue includes revenue derived from the provision of certain services and licensed technology for which charges are based on a fixed-fee and varies according to the usage of the service technology in each accounting period.
Income is recognised over the period of service once the obligations under the contracts have passed.
Where amounts are billed and obligations not met, revenue is deferred.
Fixed-term arrangements Other income receivable under fixed-term arrangements is recognised as revenue over the term of the agreement on a straight line basis.
Distribution costs Distribution costs represent the direct costs of the function of providing services to customers, costs of the development function and advertising costs.
Share-based payments Certain employees participate in the Groups share option plans which commenced with effect from 1 December 2005.
The fair value of the equity settled options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period and the credit is taken to equity, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is determined by the Black-Scholes and Binomial valuation model.
The share options plan does not have any performance conditions other than continued service.
Where equity settled share options are settled in cash at the groups discretion the debit is taken to equity.
The Group has also granted awards to be distributed from the Groups Employee Benefit Trust.
The fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the grant, some of the grants have performance conditions.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 | 95 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Note 2 Significant accounting policies continued Income taxes and deferred taxation Provision for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the tax legislations and applicable tax rates in force at the balance sheet date in the countries in which the Group companies are incorporated.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: the same taxable Group company: or different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
Dividend distribution Final dividends are recorded in the Groups financial information in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise computers and gaming machines, buildings and leasehold and buildings improvements, office furniture and equipment, and motor vehicles and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Carrying amounts are reviewed on each balance sheet date for impairment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are: % Computers and gaming machines 33 Office furniture and equipment 7-33 Buildings and Leasehold and buildings improvements 10-20, or over the length of the lease Motor vehicles 15 Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations The consolidated financial information incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised at cost less, if any, provision for impairment.
96 | Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Note 2 Significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise externally acquired patents, domains and customer lists.
Intangible assets also include internally generated capitalised software development costs.
All such intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Where intangible assets are acquired as part of a business combination they are recorded initially at their fair value.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to its recoverable amount.
Amortisation is calculated at annual rates estimated to write off the costs of the assets over their expected useful lives and is charged to operating expenses from the point the asset is brought into use.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are: % Domain names Nil Internally generated capitalised development costs 20-33 Technology IP 13-33 Customer lists In line with projected cash flows or 7-20 Affiliate contracts 5-12.5 Patents and license Over the expected useful lives 10-33 Management believes that the useful life of the domain names is indefinite.
Domain names are reviewed for impairment annually.
Expenditure incurred on development activities including the Groups software development is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain an intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, the Groups interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost comprised the fair value of assets given, and liabilities assumed, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration arising on business combinations completed by this date were treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, resulted in a change in the carrying value of goodwill.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, cost comprises the fair value of assets given and liabilities assumed, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired business.
Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss.
For combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, within administrative costs.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment, annually or more specifically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end.
Other non-financial assets are subject to annual impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to establish the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the groups cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line item in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 | 97 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Note 2 Significant accounting policies continued Associates and structured agreements Where the Group has the power to participate in but not control the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, it is classified as an associate.
Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost.
Subsequently associates are accounted for using the equity method, where the Groups share of post-acquisition profits and losses and other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income except for losses in excess of the Groups investment in the associate unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate.
The investors share in the associates profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate.
Where there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
Joint ventures The group is a party to a joint arrangement when there is a contractual arrangement that confers joint control over the relevant activities of the arrangement to the Group and at least one other party.
Joint control is assessed under the same principles as control over subsidiaries.
The Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either: Joint ventures where the group has rights to only the net assets of the joint arrangement: or Joint operations where the group has rights to both the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
In assessing the classification of interests in joint arrangements, the Group considers: The structure of the joint arrangement: The legal form of joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle: The contractual terms of the joint arrangement agreement: and Any other facts and circumstances including any other contractual arrangements.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures in the same manner as investments in Associates i. e. using the equity method refer above.
Any premium paid for an investment in a joint venture above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the investment in joint venture.
Where there is objective evidence that the investment in a joint venture has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
The Group accounts for its interests joint operations by recognising its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with its contractually conferred rights and obligations.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group does not hold any financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to customers e. g. trade receivables, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
The Groups receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and loans to customers in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables which principally represent amounts due from licensees are carried at original invoice value less an estimate made for bad and doubtful debts based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year-end.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Where cash is on deposit with maturity dates greater than three months, it is disclosed within other receivables.
Loans to customers are in respect of formal loan agreements entered into between the Group and its customers, which are carried at original advanced value less provision for impairment.
They are classified between current and non-current assets in accordance with the contractual repayment terms of each loan agreement.
98 | Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Note 2 Significant accounting policies continued Financial assets continued Available-for-sale financial assets Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value generally recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available for sale reserve.
In accordance with IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Several of the Groups licensees participate in progressive jackpot games.
Each time a progressive jackpot game is played, a preset amount is added to a cumulative jackpot for that specific game.
The accrual for the jackpot at the consolidated balance sheet date is included in progressive jackpot and other operators jackpot liabilities.
The Groups liability in connection with client funds includes customer deposits offset by the fair value of open positions, the movement on which is recognised through profit or loss.
Such open positions are classified as short term financial derivatives in the balance sheet.
Liability components of convertible loan notes are measured as described further below.
Loans and bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated balance sheet.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premia payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
Fair value measurement hierarchy IFRS 7 requires certain disclosure which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement see note 30.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: a Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : b Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 2 : and c Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 3.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorized is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
The Group measures its Available-for-sale investments at fair value refer to Note 15 for more detailed information in respect of the fair value measurement.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity and are stated at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Employee Benefit Trust Consideration paid received for the purchase sale of shares subsequently put in the Employee Benefit Trust is recognised directly in equity.
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve the Employee Benefit Trust reserve.
Any excess of the consideration received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to retained earnings.
Convertible bond The proceeds received on issue of the Groups convertible bond are allocated into their liability and equity components.
The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that does not include an option to convert.
Subsequently, the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond, where the option meets the definition of an equity instrument.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in the Convertible bond option reserve within shareholders equity.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 | 99 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Note 2 Significant accounting policies continued Long term liabilities Long term liabilities are those liabilities that are due for repayment or settlement in more than twelve months from balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions, which are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable that an outflow of funds will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Leases Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group an operating lease, the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interest is recognised at the present ownership instruments proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Adjusted results Adjusted results are amended for income or expense that helps to better understand the trading performance of the business.
Such exclusions include: Material non-cash items, e. g. amortisation of intangibles on acquisition, change in fair value of available-for-sale investments in the income statement and Employee Share Option Plan expenses.
Material one-off items, e. g. gain on sale of investment in associates, professional services cost related to acquisitions, irrecoverable deposit and professional fees on abandoned acquisitions and other exceptional projects.
Underlying adjusted results excludes the following items in order to present a more accurate like for like comparison over the comparable period: The impact of acquisitions made in the period or in the comparable period: and Specific material agreements, adjustments to previous years or currency fluctuations affecting the results in the period and the comparable period.
A full reconciliation of adjustments is included in note 5.
Note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgments that may potentially have a significant impact on the Groups earnings and financial position are detailed below.
Estimates and assumptions Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill, intangible assets not yet in use and indefinite life assets have suffered any impairment.
The Group is required to test other intangibles if events of changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Such estimates are based on managements experience of the business, but actual outcomes may vary.
More details including carrying values are included in Note 12.
Amortisation of development costs and other intangible assets and the useful life of property, plant and equipment Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives.
Useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness.
Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the amounts charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.
More details including carrying values are included in Notes 11 and 12.
100 | Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Compliance risk Legal, regulatory and taxation Legal proceedings and contingent liabilities Management regularly monitors the key risks affecting the Group, including the regulatory environment in which the Group operates.
A provision will be made where there is a present obligation from a past event, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and the amount of costs of the transfer can be estimated reliably.
In instances where the criteria are not met, a contingent liability may be disclosed in the notes to the financial information.
More details are included in Note 31.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income tax in jurisdictions in which its companies are incorporated and registered and judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group is basing its tax provisions on current and enacted but not yet implemented tax rules and practices, together with advice received from professional advisers, and believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open enquiry years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law.
The Group constantly monitors changes in legislation and update its accruals accordingly.
The principal risks relating to the Groups tax liabilities, and the sustainability of the underlying effective tax rate, arise from domestic and international tax laws and practices in the e-commerce environment continuing to evolve, including the corporate tax rates in jurisdictions where the Group has a significant asset or people presence.
More details are included in Note 8.
Regulatory The Groups subsidiary, Safecap investments Limited Safecap, is primarily regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.
The regulatory environment is regularly changing and imposes significant demands of the resources of the subsidiary.
As the subsidiarys activities expand, offering new products and penetrating new markets, these regulatory demands will inevitably increase.
The increasing complexity of the Groups operations require training and recruitment be tailored to meet these regulatory demands and the costs of compliance are expected to increase.
In addition to the above, Safecap manages it capital resources on the basis of capital adequacy requirements as prescribed it regulator, together with its own assessment of other business risks and sensitivities which may impact the business.
Capital adequacy requirements are monitored on a real-time basis, including a buffer which is deemed sufficient by management to ensure that capital requirements are not breached at any time.
Structured agreements For all arrangements structured in separate vehicles the Group must assess the substance of the arrangement in determining whether it meets the definition to be classified as an associate or joint venture.
Factors the group must consider include: Structure Legal form Contractual agreement Other facts and circumstances.
Upon consideration of these factors, the Group has determined that all of its arrangements structured through separate vehicles give it significant influence but not joint control rights to the net assets and are therefore classified as associates.
Share-based payments The Group has a share-based remuneration scheme for employees.
The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Black-Scholes and Binomial models, on the date of grant based on certain assumptions.
Those assumptions are described in Note 10 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate, expected share price volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest.
Determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired on business combinations The fair value of the intangible assets acquired is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset.
Further information in relation to the determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired is given in Notes 26 and 27.
Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration The fair value of contingent consideration is based on the probability of expected cash flow outcomes and the assessment of present values using appropriate discount rates.
Further information in relation to the determination of the fair value of contingent consideration is given in Note 26 and 27.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 | 101 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Note 4 Segment information The Groups reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
The operating segments identified are: Gaming: including Casino, Services, Sport, Bingo, Poker and Land-based Financial: including CFD The Group-wide profit measures are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net profit see Note 5.
Management believes the adjusted profit measures represent more closely the underlying trading performance of the business.
No other differences exist between the basis of preparation of the performance measures used by management and the figures in the Group financial information.
There is no allocation of operating expenses, profit measures, assets and liabilities to individual products within the segments.
Aggregate revenue from these licensees totalled 192.3 million 2014: 185.9 million.

Acquisition of Markets Limited previously named TradeFX Limited continued The key assumptions used by management to determine the value in use of the IP Technology, Customer lists and Domains within these acquisitions are as follows: The income approach, in particular, the multi period excess earnings method.
The royalty rate was based on a third party market participant assumption for use of the IP Technology and Domains, considering market competition, quality, absolute and relative profitability.
The discount rate assumed is equivalent to the WACC for the IP Technology, Customer lists and Domains.
The non-controlling interest calculation was based on the net identified assets, and also included fair value adjustment due to unvested share options as of the date of acquisition.
This adjustment has increased the goodwill.
Following the acquisition of Markets Limited formerly TradeFX Limited on 7 May 2015, the Group recognised the provisional fair value of certain intangible assets including goodwill in the interim accounts at 30 June 2015.
Subsequently, additional information became available which impacted the provisional fair values recognised on the acquisition date and, in accordance with IFRS3, the Group has taken the additional information into account in computing the final fair value of the related assets recognised in these financial statements.
The effect of amending the provisional fair values as described above was to: i decrease intangible assets including goodwill by 95m: and ii decrease contingent consideration by 95m.
Accordingly, there was no impact on net assets.
Since the acquisition date, Markets has contributed 60.0 million to the Group revenue in the period, 14.2 million to the adjusted net profits and 15.9 million and adjusted EBITDA.
The combined Group revenues as if the Markets acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2015 would have been higher by 90.2 million, the combined Group adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net profit would have been higher by 25.9 million and 19.1 million respectively.

The objective of financial risk management is to contain, where appropriate, exposures in these financial risks to limit any negative impact on the Groups financial performance and position.
The Groups financial instruments are its cash, available-for-sale financial assets, trade receivables, loan receivables, bank borrowings, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operation.
The Group actively measures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to the segregation of duties and principals.
The risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk and market price risk, which include interest rate risk, currency risk and equity price risk.
The risk management policies employed by the Group to manage these risks are discussed below.
Market risk Market risk changes in line with fluctuations in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equities and commodities prices.
These market prices affect the Groups income or the value of its holding in financial instruments.
Exposure to market risk In the financial trading division, the Group has exposure to market risk to the extent that it has open positions.
The Groups exposure to market risk at any point in time depends primarily on short-term market conditions and client activities during the trading day.
The exposure at each reporting date is therefore not considered representative of the market risk exposure faced by the Group over the year.
The Groups exposure to market risk is mainly determined by the clients open position.
The most significant market risk faced by the Group on the CFD products it offers changes in line with market changes and the volume of clients transactions.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest changes.
The management monitors interest rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and acts accordingly.
Where the Group has generated a significant amount of cash, it will invest in higher earning interest deposit accounts.
These deposit accounts are short term and the Group is not unduly exposed to market interest rate fluctuations.
During the year the group advanced loans to affiliates and customers for a total amount of 2.3 million 2014: 3.1 million.
The average interest on the loans is 5%.
A 1% change in deposit interest rates would impact on the profit before tax by 23 thousands.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 | 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Note 30 Financial instruments and risk management continued B.
Credit risk Credit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial assets on hand at the balance sheet date.
The Group closely monitors the activities of its counterparties and controls the access to its intellectual property which enables it to ensure the prompt collection of customers balances.
The Groups main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents as well as trade and other receivables and represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in connection with its financial assets.
Trade and other receivables are carried on the balance sheet net of bad debt provisions estimated by the Directors based on prior year experience and an evaluation of prevailing economic circumstances.
Wherever possible and commercially practical the Group invests cash with major financial institutions that have a rating of at least Aas defined by Standard & Poors.
While the majority of money is held in line with the above policy, a small amount is held at various institutions with no rating.
The Group also holds small deposits in Cypriot and Spanish financial institutions, as required by the respective gaming regulators that have a rating below A-.
The Group holds approximately 2% of its funds 2014: 3% in financial institutions below Arate and 3% in payment methods with no rating.
Financial Financial institutions institutions with Aand below Arating Total above rating and no rating 000 000 000 At 31 December 2015 857,898 813,164 44,734 At 31 December 2014 692,347 674,925 17,422 The Group has no credit risk to clients since all accounts have an automatic margin call, which relates to a guaranteed stop such that the clients maximum loss is covered by the deposit.
The Group has risk management and monitoring processes for clients accounts and this is achieved via margin calling and close-out process.
The ageing of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired can be analysed as follows: More than 1-2 months 2 months Total Not past due overdue past due 000 000 000 000 At 31 December 2015 74,632 47,945 12,849 13,838 At 31 December 2014 45,056 30,605 8,423 6,028 The above balances relate to customers with no default history and management estimate full recoverability given the provision below.
A provision for doubtful debtors is included within trade receivables that can be reconciled as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Provision at the beginning of the year 908 932 Charged to income statement Utilised 822 24 Provision at end of year 86 908 Related party receivables included in Note 16 are not past due.
124 | Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Note 30 Financial instruments and risk management continued C. Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world.
However, the functional currency of those operations is the same as the Groups primary functional currency Euro and the Group is not substantially exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates in respect of assets held overseas.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when Group operations are entered into, and when the Group holds cash balances, in currencies denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
The Groups policy is not to enter into any currency hedging transactions.
D. Equity price risk The Groups balance sheet is exposed to market risk by way of holding some investments in other companies on a short term basis Note 14.
Variations in market value over the life of these investments have or will have an impact on the balance sheet and the income statement.
The Directors believe that the exposure to market price risk is acceptable in the Groups circumstances.
The Groups balance sheet at 31 December 2015 includes available-for-sale investments with a value of 237.1 million 2014: 24.2 million which are subject to fluctuations in the underlying share price.
A change of 1% in shares price will have an impact of 23.7 million on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the fair value of the available for sale investments will change by the same amount.
E. Capital disclosures The Group seeks to maintain a capital structure which enables it to continue as a going concern and which supports its business strategy.
The Groups capital is provided by equity and debt funding.
The Group manages its capital structure through cash flow from operations, returns to shareholders primarily in the form of dividends and the raising or repayment of debt.
F. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the financial charges on its debt instruments.
Financial division liquidity risk Positions can be closed at any time by clients and can also be closed by the Group, in accordance with the Groups margining rules.
If after closing a position a client is in surplus, then the amount owing is repayable on demand by the Group.
When client positions are closed, any corresponding positions relating to the hedged position if applicable are closed with brokers.
Liquidity risk arises if the Group encounters difficulty in meeting obligations which arise following profitable positions being closed by clients.
This risk is managed through the Group holding client funds in separately segregated accounts whereby cash is transferred to or from the segregated accounts on a daily basis to ensure that no material mismatch arises between the aggregate of client deposits and the fair value of open positions, and segregated cash.
Through this risk management process, the Group considers liquidity risk to be low.

Note 31 Contingent liabilities As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments and their potential impact on the Group.
Management is not aware of any contingencies that may have a significant impact on the financial position of the Group.
