The above is stated for the UK portfolio only.
EPRA Net Initial Yield NIY basis of calculation EPRA NIY is calculated as the annualised net rent on a cash flow basis, divided by the gross value of the completed property portfolio.
The valuation of our completed property portfolio is determined by our external valuers as at 31 March 2015, plus an allowance for estimated purchasers costs.
Estimated purchasers costs are determined by the relevant stamp duty liability, plus an estimate by our valuers of agent and legal fees on notional acquisition.
The net rent deduction allowed for property outgoings is based on our valuers assumptions on future recurring non-recoverable revenue expenditure.
176 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Table B continued In calculating the EPRA topped-up NIY, the annualised net rent is increased by the total contracted rent from expiry of rent-free periods and future contracted rental uplifts where defined as not in lieu of growth.
Overall topped-up NIY is calculated by adding any other contracted future uplift to the topped-up net annualised rent.
The net reversionary yield is calculated by dividing the total estimated rental value ERV for the completed property portfolio, as determined by our external valuers, by the gross completed property portfolio valuation.
The EPRA vacancy rate is calculated as the ERV of the unrented, lettable space as a proportion of the total rental value of the completed property portfolio.
